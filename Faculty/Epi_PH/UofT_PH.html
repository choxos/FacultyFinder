interested in aging attention and memory and how environmental factors and traits such as circadian rhythms or second language acquisition can alter what we believe to be true of all the above a major goal for the lab is to explore the intersection between more long term lifestyle factors and short term contextual factors research in the lab uses behavior and neuroimaging techniques together to explore the themes outlined above how depression impacts grey and white matter microstructural organization depression is a significant risk factor for conversion from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment mci and from mci to alzheimer s disease ad the pathways affected by depression and dementia are thought to overlap however evidence linking the two is tenuous at camh i explored how depression affects grey and white matter microstructure across the spectrum of healthy aging to dementia time of day effects circadian rhythms from circa diem or about a day occur everywhere in nature and affect most biological systems importantly for psychologists they also affect behavior particularly attention humans tend to be most alert and able to respond to demanding situations at their circadian peak and this peak in arousal shifts across the lifespan older adults get up early in the morning and tend to go to bed early while adolescents do the opposite many research studies fail to consider that testing older adults late in the day puts them at a disadvantage we show that when you test older adults at their optimal time of day the morning they have younger looking brain activity patterns and networks this research suggests that what we typically think of as age may be partially attributed to other factors bilingualism and cogitive reserve managing two languages in one mind is cognitively demanding bilingual individuals must select the appropriate language for a given context from two or more competing representations over a lifetime it is thought that practice managing and selecting the proper linguistic response leads to domain general cognitive benefits by way of example being bilingual has been shown to delay the onset of dementia by up to 4 years one current project is examining the functional and structural correlates of bilingualism in aging we are employing a multitude of different imaging and behavioral techniques our preliminary results align with our findings from a recent review bilinguals rely on frontal circuits less than monolinguals do this pattern of responding may help to explain why bilinguals weather aging better than monolinguals do

following transplantation 2 real time exposure of ambient air pollutants and vehicular exhaust and their effect on respiratory and cardiac function in vivo using different animal models of chronic

low and middle income countries effectiveness is heterogeneous in some cases these programs are efficacious during development and testing but not when implemented the designs might not account for culture logistical challenges local government influence support structures and the complexity of poverty as a result there are two angles of research and implementation science that i am intrigued by 1 informing intervention design and strategy and 2 innovating implementation methods that complement and leverage the existing social cultural and contextual structures of each community i have extensive experience in a variety of low and middle income countries lmics where commendable efforts have been made to tackle challenges such as tuberculosis and child malnutrition but a disconnect between national health systems and the poorest communities persist for households in these communities it appears that social networks and cohesion are critical factors to healthcare access utilization and intervention success at the same time trust knowledge attitudes and psychosocial factors must be addressed too innovating programs to address these factors could significantly improve outcomes and ultimately the health of the community these complex topics require inter disciplinary teams collaborating with dynamic network analysts behavioural economists mathematical modelers etc i am exploring a range of topics focused on improving interventions for households marginalized by poverty the overarching goal is for the findings from the body of research that i conduct to be
