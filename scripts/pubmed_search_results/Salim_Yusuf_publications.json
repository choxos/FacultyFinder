We assessed the associations of macronutrient consumption, including carbohydrate, protein, total fat, saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, with vascular brain injury and cognitive scores. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 9886 middle-aged adults in four countries free of clinically apparent cardiovascular disease from the Canadian Alliance ...",

Single-pill combination (SPC) therapies consisting of a statin and 1 or more antihypertensive drugs, with or without aspirin, can reduce rates of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease, but their use is currently limited. The authors modeled the potential impact of widespread adoption of SPC therapies over 2023 to 2050. We used state-transition and demographic modeling approaches to projec...",
