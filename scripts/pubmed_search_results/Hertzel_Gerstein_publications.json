Adapting Cox models to account for between-subject heterogeneity in multiple events and understanding its impact plays crucial roles in total event analysis. This study compares effect sizes from first event and total event analyses in three cardiovascular trials: ORIGIN (N = 12,537, median follow-up of 6.2 years), COMPASS (N = 18,278, median ...",

With the availability of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, basal insulin (BI) therapy is no longer the first-line option after lifestyle modification plus oral agents is insufficient. In contrast to BI, the newer medications require minor titration, lower hyperglycemia in a glucose-dependent manner, and reduce body weight. Importantly, the...",

Data were linked with the Israeli National Diabetes Registry. Glucosuria was confirmed following normal renal function and glucose tolerance tests. Cox models were applied. The study included 1,611,467 adolescents, of whom 755 (0.05%) had glucosuria. The latter group had a higher proportion of males (75% vs. 57%) and a lo...",
