TI  - Greater child dental health inequality in England compared to Wales and Northern 
      Ireland, despite lower average disease levels.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental caries and inequalities in dental health are major public 
      health concerns. AIM: To report variation in dental caries experience across 
      deprivation quintiles and the magnitude of inequalities between countries. 
      DESIGN: Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the 2013 Child Dental 
      Health Survey (CDHS) in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Distribution of dental caries across deprivation quintiles were 
      estimated using as proportions and means. The magnitude of inequalities was 
      calculated using the Relative Index of Inequality (RII). MAIN OUTCOMES: Dental 
      caries experience as indicated by the prevalence (%dmft/DMFT>0) and severity 
      (dmft/DMFT) of 'obvious' and 'clinical' decay experience in both primary and 
      permanent dentitions. RESULTS: Children from more deprived quintiles showed 
      higher prevalence and severity of dental caries. RIIs for dental caries were 
      greater in England than Wales or Northern Ireland, indicating greater relative 
      inequalities despite lower average dental caries experience. The prevalence and 
      severity of dental caries among the most deprived children in England were 1.7 to 
      3.7 times greater than those of the least deprived. CONCLUSION: There is a 
      deprivation gradient in child dental caries in all three countries, with England 
      showing the greatest inequalities.

TI  - Novel Coronavirus Infection (COVID-19) in Humans: A Scoping Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.

AB  - A growing body of literature on the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is 
      becoming available, but a synthesis of available data has not been conducted. We 
      performed a scoping review of currently available clinical, epidemiological, 
      laboratory, and chest imaging data related to the SARS-CoV-2 infection. We 
      searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, EMBASE, Scopus and LILACS from 01 January 
      2019 to 24 February 2020. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias 
      assessment were performed by two independent reviewers. Qualitative synthesis and 
      meta-analysis were conducted using the clinical and laboratory data, and 
      random-effects models were applied to estimate pooled results. A total of 61 
      studies were included (59,254 patients). The most common disease-related symptoms 
      were fever (82%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 56%-99%; n = 4410), cough (61%, 95% 
      CI 39%-81%; n = 3985), muscle aches and/or fatigue (36%, 95% CI 18%-55%; n = 
      3778), dyspnea (26%, 95% CI 12%-41%; n = 3700), headache in 12% (95% CI 4%-23%, n 
      = 3598 patients), sore throat in 10% (95% CI 5%-17%, n = 1387) and 
      gastrointestinal symptoms in 9% (95% CI 3%-17%, n = 1744). Laboratory findings 
      were described in a lower number of patients and revealed lymphopenia (0.93 x 
      10(9)/L, 95% CI 0.83-1.03 x 10(9)/L, n = 464) and abnormal C-reactive protein 
      (33.72 mg/dL, 95% CI 21.54-45.91 mg/dL; n = 1637). Radiological findings varied, 
      but mostly described ground-glass opacities and consolidation. Data on treatment 
      options were limited. All-cause mortality was 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%-1.0%; n = 
      53,631). Epidemiological studies showed that mortality was higher in males and 
      elderly patients. The majority of reported clinical symptoms and laboratory 
      findings related to SARS-CoV-2 infection are non-specific. Clinical suspicion, 
      accompanied by a relevant epidemiological history, should be followed by early 
      imaging and virological assay.

AB  - Healthcare decision-making is a process that mainly depends on evidence and 
      involves increasing numbers of stakeholders, including the consumers. Cochrane 
      evidence responds to this challenge by identifying, appraising, integrating and 
      synthesizing high-quality evidence. Recently, a collaborative effort has been 
      initiated in Iran with Cochrane to establish a representative local entity. A 
      variety of multifaceted interventions were conducted according to Cochrane's 
      strategy to 2020, such as producing evidence, making Cochrane evidence 
      accessible, advocating for evidence and building an effective and sustainable 
      organization. In this report, the authors present the two and half year 
      performance and achievements of Cochrane Iran based on a comprehensive and 
      systematic approach. This case might be an example of health diplomacy, which is 
      initiated by a successful international collaboration and proceed with 
      recognizing the importance of adherence to the strategic action plans and goals.

AB  - Data sources Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline 
      (Ovid), Embase, Web of Science, Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences 
      Literature (LILACS) and SIGLE database.Study selection Randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs), cohort studies, case-control 
      studies and cross-sectional studies.Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers 
      screened papers independently and assessed the risk of bias. Data categorised 
      based on the study design. The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR)/relative 
      risk (RR) and confidence interval (CI) for hypertension in individuals with 
      periodontitis.Results Diagnoses of moderate-to-severe (OR = 1.22; 95% CI: 
      1.10-1.35) and severe periodontitis (OR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.09-2.05) were 
      associated with hypertension. Diagnosis of periodontitis increased odds of 
      occurring hypertension (OR = 1.68; 95% CI: 0.85-3.35). Patients with 
      periodontitis exhibited higher mean systolic (weighted mean difference [WMD] of 
      4.49 mmHg; 95% CI: 2.88-6.11) and diastolic blood pressures (2.03 mmHg; 95% CI: 
      1.25-2.81). There was inconclusive evidence that periodontal therapy reduces 
      blood pressure (3-12.5 mmHg of systolic and 0-10 mmHg of diastolic blood 
      pressures).Conclusions Periodontitis could be associated with increased risk of 
      hypertension. Further, the management of periodontitis could impact on the 
      management of hypertension. However, there is still a need for more high-quality 
      research.

      many ways worldwide, including access to oral health services. This study aims to 
      assess the association between lockdown due to COVID-19 and online searches for 
      toothache in Iran using Google Trends (GT). METHODS: We investigated GT online 
      searches for toothache within the past five years. The time frame for data 
      gathering was considered as the initiation and end dates of the national lockdown 
      in Iran. We performed one-way ANOVA statistical test to compare relative search 
      volumes (RSVs) between the year 2020 and 2016-2019 for the whole country. Then we 
      investigated the possible association of RSVs in provinces with dentists' 
      density, prevalence of current daily smokers, Human Development Index (HDI), 
      Internet access, and fluoride concentration in water using linear regression. 
      RESULTS: When comparing 2020 with the previous four years, there was a rise of 
      2020 RSVs versus all previous years combined and each year (P < 0.001 for all of 
      them). In the linear model for the year 2020, HDI (B = - 3.29, 95% CI: (- 5.80, 
      - 0.78), P = 0.012) had a strong negative relationship with provincial RSVs. HDI 
      mostly had strong positive relationship with provincial RSVs in prior years. 
      Fluoride concentration (B = - 0.13, 95% CI: (- 0.24, - 0.03), P = 0.017) and 
      dentists' density (B = - 0.04, 95% CI: (- 0.25, 0.17), P = 0.669) were also 
      negatively associated with RSVs in 2020. These associations were mostly negative 
      in the previous years as well. Internet access (B = 0.36, 95% CI: (- 0.38, 1.09), 
      P = 0.325) and prevalence of daily smokers (B = 0.33, 95% CI: (0.13, 0.53), 
      P = 0.002) were positively associated with RSVs. CONCLUSION: The RSVs for 
      toothache in 2020 have increased due to COVID-19-imposed lockdown compared with 
      the same period in the past four years. This increase was related to 
      socioeconomic factors.

AB  - Although health is mostly determined by socio-political factors, the need for 
      providing reliable health recommendations to the public should not be neglected. 
      There has been a considerable void in delivering evidence-informed oral health 
      recommendations in Iran; whilst there is a significant gap in oral health 
      knowledge among socioeconomic classes, recommendations are neither fully 
      compatible with each other nor up-to-date. To fill in this void, we started 
      Dahaan (meaning "mouth" in Persian) with the aim of providing the latest easily 
      accessed evidence-informed dentistry recommendations and advocating dental public 
      health in the Iranian community. In this paper, we as the authors present the 
      performance and achievements of this group, which is a member of the NCD Alliance 
      and the Informed Health Choices project with a reasonable number of readers 
      across the country, and illustrate the way ahead towards our goals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research misconduct is a global concern in biomedical science. There 
      are no comprehensive data regarding the perception and situation of scientific 
      misconduct among the Iranian medical faculty members. We conducted a nationwide 
      survey to assess the research misconduct among the medical faculty members in 
      Iran. METHODS: We used the Persian version of the research misconduct 
      questionnaire (PRMQ) on the Google Forms platform. We sent the survey link to a 
      systematic random sample of medical faculty members in Iran (N = 4986). 
      Descriptive analyses were performed on the individual items of the PRMQ, with 
      frequencies and percentages for categorical and Likert-type response items, and 
      means and standard deviation (S.D.) for continuous variables. Chi-square analysis 
      was conducted to test hypotheses examining differences in the frequency of 
      responses related to factors influencing misconduct. We also defined four tenure 
      categories (TC) based on the working years of the participants as tenured faculty 
      members. All the analyses were performed using R 3.6.0. RESULTS: The response 
      rate was 13.8% (692 responses). Nearly 70% of the respondents agreed that their 
      publication output would be of higher quality if there were no publication 
      pressure. Approximately three-quarters (N =499, 72.1%) of the respondents had 
      been aware of some instances of research misconduct during the previous year 
      according to their understanding of misconduct. Among the participants, 18.5% 
      perceived the effectiveness of their associated organisation's rules for reducing 
      research misconduct to be high or very high. Pressure for tenure was identified 
      as the item most frequently perceived with a strong behavioural influence on 
      engaging in research misconduct (80.2%). CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that 
      research misconduct needs to be actively addressed among the medical faculty 
      members. Making policies with a focus on boosting awareness regarding the 
      occasions of scientific misconduct and its management seems to be indispensable 
      in the future in Iran.

AB  - Data sources Medline (using PubMed) and Google Scholar. Also, a case was reported 
      by the authors.Study selection Case reports dealing with oral manifestations of 
      COVID-19.Data extraction and synthesis Two reviewers independently reviewed 
      articles and papers which reported any oral lesions in patients with COVID-19 and 
      summarised the data. In addition, they collated all relevant information about 
      each case.Results The authors described a case history in which oral symptoms 
      were observed which included dry mouth, acute dysgeusia, mild pain and burning 
      sensation in lower lip mucosa, then after two days, vesicles appeared in the same 
      region with simultaneous systemic symptoms of COVID-19. The patient reported a 
      previous history of herpetic infections. After seven days, oral lesions were 
      healed and systemic symptoms regressed on day 14.Literature review Seventeen 
      studies reporting 226 confirmed cases, and the case reported by the review 
      authors, were included. The age range was between 9-90 years. More than 170 cases 
      developed oral manifestations. The most common oral manifestations were dry mouth 
      (n = 75), dysgeusia (n = 71) and pseudomembranous fungal structure (n = 67). 
      Changes in tongue sensation (n = 48) and ulceration (n = 28), muscle pain during 
      mastication (n = 15), swelling in the oral cavity (n = 10) and herpetic lesions 
      (n = 6) were other common symptoms. The mean onset time of the oral manifestation 
      was 7.21 days after systemic symptoms (range: 10-42 days). In 42 cases, oral 
      lesions resolved spontaneously or with some basic treatment within three 
      weeks.Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 may present oral manifestations 
      during their course of the disease; however, we do not know if there is a causal 
      relationship between COVID-19 and these manifestations or not.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the Risk of Bias (RoB) and other characteristics of 
      published randomised clinical trials within Cochrane oral health systematic 
      reviews. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All the published clinical trials within Cochrane 
      oral health systematic reviews until 1 June 2020 were identified and examined. 
      RoB was assessed for all the included clinical trials according to the Cochrane 
      review standards. The Overall Risk of Bias (ORoB) was defined in this study using 
      Cochrane's RoB tool-v2. Descriptive analyses were carried out to determine the 
      frequency of each variable in the study sample. RESULTS: Out of a total of 2565 
      included studies, the majority (n = 1600) had sample sizes of 50 or higher. 
      Regarding blinding, 907 studies were labelled as double-blind. Among the various 
      domains of bias, the performance bias showed the highest rate of high risk 
      (31.4%). Almost half of the studies had a high ORoB, compared to 11.1% with a low 
      ORoB. The studies that used placebos had a higher percentage of low ORoB (14.8% 
      vs. 10.7%). Additionally, the double- and triple-blind studies had higher 
      percentages of low ORoB (23.6% and 23.3%, respectively), while the studies with a 
      crossover design had the highest percentage of low ORoB (28.8%). CONCLUSION: The 
      RoB of oral health studies published as Cochrane reviews was deemed high.

      Effects.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph18157859 [doi]
LID - 7859
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine-related side effects have a 
      determinant role in the public decision regarding vaccination. Therefore, this 
      study has been designed to actively monitor the safety and effectiveness of 
      COVID-19 vaccines globally. METHODS: A multi-country, three-phase study including 
      a cross-sectional survey to test for the short-term side effects of COVID-19 
      vaccines among target population groups. In the second phase, we will monitor the 
      booster doses' side effects, while in the third phase, the long-term safety and 
      effectiveness will be investigated. A validated, self-administered questionnaire 
      will be used to collect data from the target population; Results: The study 
      protocol has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, with the identifier 
      NCT04834869. CONCLUSIONS: CoVaST is the first independent study aiming to monitor 
      the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines following booster doses, and the long-term 
      safety and effectiveness of said vaccines.

TI  - Global, regional, and national burden and quality of care index (QCI) of lip and 
      oral cavity cancer: a systematic analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 
      1990-2017.
PG  - 558

AB  - BACKGROUND: To measure the quality of care for lip and oral cavity cancer 
      worldwide using the data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2017. 
      METHODS: After devising four main indices of quality of care for lip and oral 
      cavity cancer using GBD 2017 study's measures, including prevalence, incidence, 
      years of life lost, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life 
      years, we utilised principal component analysis (PCA) to determine a component 
      that bears the most proportion of info among the others. This component of the 
      PCA was considered as the Quality-of-Care Index (QCI) for lip and oral cavity 
      cancer. The QCI score was then reported in both men and women worldwide and 
      different countries based on the socio-demographic index (SDI) and World Bank 
      classifications. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2017, care quality continuously 
      increased globally (from 53.7 to 59.6). In 1990, QCI was higher for men (53.5 for 
      men compared with 50.8 for women), and in 2017 QCI increased for both men and 
      women, albeit a slightly higher rise for women (57.2 for men compared with 59.9 
      for women). During the same period, age-standardised QCI for lip and oral cavity 
      cancer increased in all regions (classified by SDI and World Bank). Globally, the 
      highest QCI scores were observed in the elderly age group, whereas the least were 
      in the adult age group. Five countries with the least amount of QCIs were all 
      African. In contrast, North American countries, West European countries and 
      Australia had the highest indices. CONCLUSION: The quality of care for lip and 
      oral cavity cancer showed a rise from 1990 to 2017, a promising outcome that 
      supports patient-oriented and preventive treatment policies previously advised in 
      the literature. However, not all countries enjoyed such an increase in the QCI to 
      the same extent. This alarming finding could imply a necessary need for better 
      access to high-quality treatments for lip and oral cavity cancer, especially in 
      central African countries and Afghanistan. More policies with a preventive 
      approach and paying more heed to the early diagnosis, broad insurance coverage, 
      and effective screening programs are recommended worldwide. More focus should 
      also be given to the adulthood age group as they had the least QCI scores 
      globally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In estimating the global burden of cancer, adolescents and young 
      adults with cancer are often overlooked, despite being a distinct subgroup with 
      unique epidemiology, clinical care needs, and societal impact. Comprehensive 
      estimates of the global cancer burden in adolescents and young adults (aged 15-39 
      years) are lacking. To address this gap, we analysed results from the Global 
      Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019, with a focus on 
      the outcome of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), to inform global cancer 
      control measures in adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Using the GBD 2019 
      methodology, international mortality data were collected from vital registration 
      systems, verbal autopsies, and population-based cancer registry inputs modelled 
      with mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). Incidence was computed with mortality 
      estimates and corresponding MIRs. Prevalence estimates were calculated using 
      modelled survival and multiplied by disability weights to obtain years lived with 
      disability (YLDs). Years of life lost (YLLs) were calculated as age-specific 
      cancer deaths multiplied by the standard life expectancy at the age of death. The 
      main outcome was DALYs (the sum of YLLs and YLDs). Estimates were presented 
      globally and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintiles (countries ranked and 
      divided into five equal SDI groups), and all estimates were presented with 
      corresponding 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). For this analysis, we used the age 
      range of 15-39 years to define adolescents and young adults. FINDINGS: There were 
      1.19 million (95% UI 1.11-1.28) incident cancer cases and 396 000 
      (370 000-425 000) deaths due to cancer among people aged 15-39 years worldwide in 
      2019. The highest age-standardised incidence rates occurred in high SDI (59.6 
      [54.5-65.7] per 100 000 person-years) and high-middle SDI countries (53.2 
      [48.8-57.9] per 100 000 person-years), while the highest age-standardised 
      mortality rates were in low-middle SDI (14.2 [12.9-15.6] per 100 000 
      person-years) and middle SDI (13.6 [12.6-14.8] per 100 000 person-years) 
      countries. In 2019, adolescent and young adult cancers contributed 23.5 million 
      (21.9-25.2) DALYs to the global burden of disease, of which 2.7% (1.9-3.6) came 
      from YLDs and 97.3% (96.4-98.1) from YLLs. Cancer was the fourth leading cause of 
      death and tenth leading cause of DALYs in adolescents and young adults globally. 
      INTERPRETATION: Adolescent and young adult cancers contributed substantially to 
      the overall adolescent and young adult disease burden globally in 2019. These 
      results provide new insights into the distribution and magnitude of the 
      adolescent and young adult cancer burden around the world. With notable 
      differences observed across SDI settings, these estimates can inform global and 
      country-level cancer control efforts. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, 
      American Lebanese Syrian Associated Charities, St Baldrick's Foundation, and the

TI  - Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and 
      Disability-Adjusted Life Years for 29 Cancer Groups From 2010 to 2019: A 
      Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
PG  - 420-444
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.6987 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 
      (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality 
      to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and 
      territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. 
      EVIDENCE REVIEW: The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer 
      incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and 
      disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. 
      Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of 
      educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those 
      younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). 
      FINDINGS: In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 
      million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) 
      and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an 
      estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these 
      represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 
      14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in 
      DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was 
      second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life 
      lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. 
      The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased 
      with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% 
      (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest 
      number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of 
      cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in 
      the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this systematic analysis suggest that 
      the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by 
      SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can 
      potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes, particularly type 1 diabetes, at younger ages can be a 
      largely preventable cause of death with the correct health care and services. We 
      aimed to evaluate diabetes mortality and trends at ages younger than 25 years 
      globally using data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
      Factors Study (GBD) 2019. METHODS: We used estimates of GBD 2019 to calculate 
      international diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years in 1990 and 2019. 
      Data sources for causes of death were obtained from vital registration systems, 
      verbal autopsies, and other surveillance systems for 1990-2019. We estimated 
      death rates for each location using the GBD Cause of Death Ensemble model. We 
      analysed the association of age-standardised death rates per 100 000 population 
      with the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a measure of universal health coverage 
      (UHC) and described the variability within SDI quintiles. We present estimates 
      with their 95% uncertainty intervals. FINDINGS: In 2019, 16 300 (95% uncertainty 
      interval 14 200 to 18 900) global deaths due to diabetes (type 1 and 2 combined) 
      occurred in people younger than 25 years and 73.7% (68.3 to 77.4) were classified 
      as due to type 1 diabetes. The age-standardised death rate was 0.50 (0.44 to 
      0.58) per 100 000 population, and 15 900 (97.5%) of these deaths occurred in low 
      to high-middle SDI countries. The rate was 0.13 (0.12 to 0.14) per 100 000 
      population in the high SDI quintile, 0.60 (0.51 to 0.70) per 100 000 population 
      in the low-middle SDI quintile, and 0.71 (0.60 to 0.86) per 100 000 population in 
      the low SDI quintile. Within SDI quintiles, we observed large variability in 
      rates across countries, in part explained by the extent of UHC (r(2)=0.62). From 
      1990 to 2019, age-standardised death rates decreased globally by 17.0% (-28.4 to 
      -2.9) for all diabetes, and by 21.0% (-33.0 to -5.9) when considering only type 1 
      diabetes. However, the low SDI quintile had the lowest decline for both all 
      diabetes (-13.6% [-28.4 to 3.4]) and for type 1 diabetes (-13.6% [-29.3 to 8.9]). 
      INTERPRETATION: Decreasing diabetes mortality at ages younger than 25 years 
      remains an important challenge, especially in low and low-middle SDI countries. 
      Inadequate diagnosis and treatment of diabetes is likely to be major contributor 
      to these early deaths, highlighting the urgent need to provide better access to 
      insulin and basic diabetes education and care. This mortality metric, derived 
      from readily available and frequently updated GBD data, can help to monitor 
      preventable diabetes-related deaths over time globally, aligned with the UN's 
      Sustainable Development Targets, and serve as an indicator of the adequacy of 
      basic diabetes care for type 1 and type 2 diabetes across nations. FUNDING: Bill

TI  - Health system performance in Iran: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Better evaluation of existing health programmes, appropriate policy 
      making against emerging health threats, and reducing inequalities in Iran rely on 
      a comprehensive national and subnational breakdown of the burden of diseases, 
      injuries, and risk factors. METHODS: In this systematic analysis, we present the 
      national and subnational estimates of the burden of disease in Iran using the 
      Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. We report trends in demographics, all-cause 
      and cause-specific mortality, as well as years of life lost (YLLs), years lived 
      with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) caused by 
      major diseases and risk factors. A multi-intervention segmented-regression model 
      was used to explore the overall impact of health sector changes and sanctions. 
      For this analysis, we used a variety of sources and reports, including vital 
      registration, census, and survey data to provide estimates of mortality and 
      morbidity at the national and subnational level in Iran. FINDINGS: Iran, which 
      had 84.3 million inhabitants in 2019, had a life expectancy of 79.6 years (95% 
      uncertainty interval 79.2-79.9) in female individuals and 76.1 (75.6-76.5) in 
      male individuals, an increase compared with 1990. The number of DALYs remained 
      stable and reached 19.8 million (17.3-22.6) in 2019, of which 78.1% were caused 
      by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) compared with 43.0% in 1990. During the study 
      period, age-standardised DALY rates and YLL rates decreased considerably; 
      however, YLDs remained nearly constant. The share of age-standardised YLDs 
      contributing to the DALY rate steadily increased to 44.5% by 2019. With regard to 
      the DALY rates of different provinces, inequalities were decreasing. From 1990 to 
      2019, although the number of DALYs attributed to all risk factors decreased by 
      16.8%, deaths attributable to all risk factors substantially grew by 43.8%. The 
      regression results revealed a significant negative association between sanctions 
      and health status. INTERPRETATION: The Iranian health-care system is encountering 
      NCDs as its new challenge, which necessitates a coordinated multisectoral 
      approach. Although the Iranian health-care system has been successful to some 
      extent in controlling mortality, it has overlooked the burden of morbidity and 
      need for rehabilitation. We did not capture alleviation of the burden of diseases 
      in Iran following the 2004 and 2014 health sector reforms; however, the sanctions 
      were associated with deaths of Iranians caused by NCDs. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the adherence to transparency practices (data 
      availability, code availability, statements of protocol registration and 
      conflicts of interest and funding disclosures) and FAIRness (Findable, 
      Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) of shared data from open access 
      COVID-19-related articles published in dental journals available from the Europe 
      PubMed Central (PMC) database. METHODS: We searched and exported all 
      COVID-19-related open-access articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals 
      available in the Europe PMC database in 2020 and 2021. We detected transparency 
      indicators with a validated and automated tool developed to extract the 
      indicators from the downloaded articles. Basic journal- and article-related 
      information was retrieved from the PMC database. Then, from those which had 
      shared data, we assessed their accordance with FAIR data principles using the 
      F-UJI online tool (f-uji.net). RESULTS: Of 650 available articles published in 59 
      dental journals, 74% provided conflicts of interest disclosure and 40% funding 
      disclosure and 4% were preregistered. One study shared raw data (0.15%) and no 
      study shared code. Transparent practices were more common in articles published 
      in journals with higher impact factors, and in 2020 than in 2021. Adherence to 
      the FAIR principles in the only paper that shared data was moderate. CONCLUSION: 
      While the majority of the papers had a COI disclosure, the prevalence of the 
      other transparency practices was far from the acceptable level. A much stronger 
      commitment to open science practices, particularly to preregistration, data and 
      code sharing, is needed from all stakeholders.

PG  - 1307-1313

AB  - According to the FAIR principles, data produced by scientific research should be 
      findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable-for instance, to be used in 
      machine learning algorithms. However, to date, there is no estimate of the 
      quantity or quality of dental research data evaluated via the FAIR principles. We 
      aimed to determine the availability of open data in dental research and to assess 
      compliance with the FAIR principles (or FAIRness) of shared dental research data. 
      We downloaded all available articles published in PubMed-indexed dental journals 
      from 2016 to 2021 as open access from Europe PubMed Central. In addition, we took 
      a random sample of 500 dental articles that were not open access through Europe 
      PubMed Central. We assessed data sharing in the articles and compliance of shared 
      data to the FAIR principles programmatically. Results showed that of 7,509 
      investigated articles, 112 (1.5%) shared data. The average (SD) level of 
      compliance with the FAIR metrics was 32.6% (31.9%). The average for each metric 
      was as follows: findability, 3.4 (2.7) of 7; accessibility, 1.0 (1.0) of 3; 
      interoperability, 1.1 (1.2) of 4; and reusability, 2.4 (2.6) of 10. No 
      considerable changes in data sharing or quality of shared data occurred over the 
      years. Our findings indicated that dental researchers rarely shared data, and 
      when they did share, the FAIR quality was suboptimal. Machine learning algorithms 
      could understand 1% of available dental research data. These undermine the 
      reproducibility of dental research and hinder gaining the knowledge that can be 
      gleaned from machine learning algorithms and applications.

TI  - Self-reported side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine among 
      healthcare workers in Ethiopia, Africa: A cross-sectional study.
PG  - 937794

LID - 937794
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa. Ethiopia 
      received most of its COVID-19 vaccines through donations. The Oxford AstraZeneca 
      vaccine is the first to be donated to Ethiopia by the COVAX facility. Healthcare 
      workers were the priority population that received the Oxford AstraZeneca 
      COVID-19 vaccine. However, there was no nationwide study on the safety of the 
      vaccine in Ethiopia. This study aimed to measure the prevalence and predictors of 
      self-reported side effects of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: The study employed a cross-sectional design. A sample of healthcare 
      workers who took Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was drawn from four regions 
      of Ethiopia; namely, Amhara, Oromia, Somali, and Southwest. Data were collected 
      on sociodemographic characteristics, medical anamnesis, COVID-19 related 
      anamnesis, and COVID-19 vaccine anamnesis via telephone interview. Descriptive 
      and inferential analyses were done. The software, IBM SPSS Statistics v21.0, was 
      used for analyses of data. RESULTS: Out of 384 people, 346 responded (response 
      rate: 90.1%). Female accounted for 34.1% of the respondents. The mean age of the 
      respondents was 31.0 years (Standard Deviation (SD) = 7.4). Nurses accounted for 
      43.7% of the respondents. The prevalence of at least one local- and systemic-side 
      effect was 50.6 and 44.5%, respectively. The most frequent local- and systemic- 
      side effect were injection site pain and headache, respectively. Both types of 
      side effects mostly subsided in the first 3 days. A third of healthcare workers 
      with side effects took at least one medication. Paracetamol followed by 
      diclofenac sodium were taken by healthcare workers to overcome side effects. 
      There was no independent predictor of local side effect. After controlling for 
      age and chronic diseases, the odds of healthcare workers with COVID-19 like 
      symptoms to experience systemic side effects was 1.38 (Confidence Interval (CI): 
      1.04-1.82) times more than that of healthcare workers without COVID-19 like 
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of local- and systemic-side effects of the 
      Oxford AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine was modest. As the symptoms were mostly 
      common in the first 3 days, it is preferable to monitor healthcare workers at 
      least in the first 3 days following the administration of the vaccine.

TI  - Risk of Bias in Iranian Randomized Trials Included in Cochrane Reviews.
PG  - 375-382
LID - 10.34172/aim.2022.61 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among interventional studies, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      provide the highest level of evidence. However, RCTs can be susceptible to the 
      risk of bias (RoB). Systematic reviews can be performed to appraise RoB in the 
      included articles using evaluative tools. This study aimed to describe the main 
      characteristics and focus on the RoB of RCTs conducted in Iran and included in 
      Cochrane Reviews (CRs). METHODS: We searched "Iran" by selecting the "Search All 
      Text" and "Review" fields in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews within 
      Ovid. CRs that included the RCTs conducted in Iran were retrieved. A trial was 
      selected only if it was included in CRs, described as a controlled clinical 
      trial, involved human subjects and CR authors assessed its RoB. The trials were 
      characterized by investigating the relevant articles and the table 
      "Characteristics of included studies" in each CR. The RoB was investigated by 
      collecting the review authors' judgments based on RoB assessment tables in the 
      CRs. RESULTS: Out of 1166 Iranian RCTs included by 571 CRs, low RoB was found in 
      44.9% for random sequence generation, 20.8% for allocation concealment, 32.3% for 
      blinding of participants/personnel, 36.5% for blinding of outcome assessors, 
      56.3% for incomplete outcome data, 41.3% for selective outcome reporting and 
      53.8% for other sources of bias. CONCLUSION: The RoB in Iranian RCTs was found to 
      be mostly high or unclear. While this is similar to the global situation, it is 
      recommended that the methodological quality of conducting and reporting RCTs be 
      addressed in Iran.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The use of phrases such as "data/results not shown" is deemed an 
      obscure way to represent scientific findings. Our aim was to investigate how 
      frequently papers published in dental journals use the phrases and what kind of 
      results the authors referred to with these phrases in 2021. METHODS: We searched 
      the Europe PubMed Central (PMC) database for open-access articles available from 
      studies published in PubMed-indexed dental journals until December 31st, 2021. We 
      searched for "data/results not shown" phrases from the full texts and then 
      calculated the proportion of articles with the phrases in all the available 
      articles. From studies published in 2021, we evaluated whether the phrases 
      referred to confirmatory results, negative results, peripheral results, 
      sensitivity analysis results, future results, or other/unclear results. Journal- 
      and publisher-related differences in publishing studies with the phrases in 2021 
      were tested with Fisher's exact test using the R v4.1.1 software. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of studies with the relevant phrases from the total number of studies 
      in the database decreased from 13% to 3% between 2010 and 2020. In 2021, out of 
      2,434 studies published in 73 different journals by eight publishers, 67 (2.8%) 
      used the phrases. Potential journal- and publisher-related differences in 
      publishing studies with the phrases were detected in 2021 (p = 0.001 and p = 
      0.005, respectively). Most commonly, the phrases referred to negative (n = 16, 
      24%), peripheral (n = 22, 33%) or confirmatory (n = 11, 16%) results. The 
      significance of unpublished results to which the phrases referred considerably 
      varied across studies. CONCLUSION: Over the last decade, there has been a marked 
      decrease in the use of the phrases "data/results not shown" in dental journals. 
      However, the phrases were still notably in use in dental studies in 2021, despite 
      the good availability of accessible free online supplements and repositories.

TI  - The global burden of cancer attributable to risk factors, 2010-19: a systematic 
      analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the magnitude of cancer burden attributable to 
      potentially modifiable risk factors is crucial for development of effective 
      prevention and mitigation strategies. We analysed results from the Global Burden 
      of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019 to inform cancer control 
      planning efforts globally. METHODS: The GBD 2019 comparative risk assessment 
      framework was used to estimate cancer burden attributable to behavioural, 
      environmental and occupational, and metabolic risk factors. A total of 82 
      risk-outcome pairs were included on the basis of the World Cancer Research Fund 
      criteria. Estimated cancer deaths and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in 
      2019 and change in these measures between 2010 and 2019 are presented. FINDINGS: 
      Globally, in 2019, the risk factors included in this analysis accounted for 4.45 
      million (95% uncertainty interval 4.01-4.94) deaths and 105 million (95.0-116) 
      DALYs for both sexes combined, representing 44.4% (41.3-48.4) of all cancer 
      deaths and 42.0% (39.1-45.6) of all DALYs. There were 2.88 million (2.60-3.18) 
      risk-attributable cancer deaths in males (50.6% [47.8-54.1] of all male cancer 
      deaths) and 1.58 million (1.36-1.84) risk-attributable cancer deaths in females 
      (36.3% [32.5-41.3] of all female cancer deaths). The leading risk factors at the 
      most detailed level globally for risk-attributable cancer deaths and DALYs in 
      2019 for both sexes combined were smoking, followed by alcohol use and high BMI. 
      Risk-attributable cancer burden varied by world region and Socio-demographic 
      Index (SDI), with smoking, unsafe sex, and alcohol use being the three leading 
      risk factors for risk-attributable cancer DALYs in low SDI locations in 2019, 
      whereas DALYs in high SDI locations mirrored the top three global risk factor 
      rankings. From 2010 to 2019, global risk-attributable cancer deaths increased by 
      20.4% (12.6-28.4) and DALYs by 16.8% (8.8-25.0), with the greatest percentage 
      increase in metabolic risks (34.7% [27.9-42.8] and 33.3% [25.8-42.0]). 
      INTERPRETATION: The leading risk factors contributing to global cancer burden in 
      2019 were behavioural, whereas metabolic risk factors saw the largest increases 
      between 2010 and 2019. Reducing exposure to these modifiable risk factors would 
      decrease cancer mortality and DALY rates worldwide, and policies should be 
      tailored appropriately to local cancer risk factor burden. FUNDING: Bill & 
      Melinda Gates Foundation.

TI  - Assessing performance of the Healthcare Access and Quality Index, overall and by 
      select age groups, for 204 countries and territories, 1990-2019: a systematic 
      analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-care needs change throughout the life course. It is thus 
      crucial to assess whether health systems provide access to quality health care 
      for all ages. Drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk 
      Factors Study 2019 (GBD 2019), we measured the Healthcare Access and Quality 
      (HAQ) Index overall and for select age groups in 204 locations from 1990 to 2019. 
      METHODS: We distinguished the overall HAQ Index (ages 0-74 years) from scores for 
      select age groups: the young (ages 0-14 years), working (ages 15-64 years), and 
      post-working (ages 65-74 years) groups. For GBD 2019, HAQ Index construction 
      methods were updated to use the arithmetic mean of scaled mortality-to-incidence 
      ratios (MIRs) and risk-standardised death rates (RSDRs) for 32 causes of death 
      that should not occur in the presence of timely, quality health care. Across 
      locations and years, MIRs and RSDRs were scaled from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) 
      separately, putting the HAQ Index on a different relative scale for each age 
      group. We estimated absolute convergence for each group on the basis of whether 
      the HAQ Index grew faster in absolute terms between 1990 and 2019 in countries 
      with lower 1990 HAQ Index scores than countries with higher 1990 HAQ Index scores 
      and by Socio-demographic Index (SDI) quintile. SDI is a summary metric of overall 
      development. FINDINGS: Between 1990 and 2019, the HAQ Index increased overall (by 
      19.6 points, 95% uncertainty interval 17.9-21.3), as well as among the young 
      (22.5, 19.9-24.7), working (17.2, 15.2-19.1), and post-working (15.1, 13.2-17.0) 
      age groups. Large differences in HAQ Index scores were present across SDI levels 
      in 2019, with the overall index ranging from 30.7 (28.6-33.0) on average in 
      low-SDI countries to 83.4 (82.4-84.3) on average in high-SDI countries. Similarly 
      large ranges between low-SDI and high-SDI countries, respectively, were estimated 
      in the HAQ Index for the young (40.4-89.0), working (33.8-82.8), and post-working 
      (30.4-79.1) groups. Absolute convergence in HAQ Index was estimated in the young 
      group only. In contrast, divergence was estimated among the working and 
      post-working groups, driven by slow progress in low-SDI countries. 
      INTERPRETATION: Although major gaps remain across levels of social and economic 
      development, convergence in the young group is an encouraging sign of reduced 
      disparities in health-care access and quality. However, divergence in the working 
      and post-working groups indicates that health-care access and quality is lagging 
      at lower levels of social and economic development. To meet the needs of ageing 
      populations, health systems need to improve health-care access and quality for 
      working-age adults and older populations while continuing to realise gains among 
      the young. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

AB  - We assessed adherence to five transparency practices-data sharing, code sharing, 
      conflict of interest disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol registration-in 
      articles in dental journals. We searched and exported the full text of all 
      research articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals available in the Europe 
      PubMed Central database until the end of 2021. We programmatically assessed their 
      adherence to the five transparency practices using a validated and automated 
      tool. Journal- and article-related information was retrieved from ScimagoJR and 
      Journal Citation Reports. Of all 329,784 articles published in PubMed-indexed 
      dental journals, 10,659 (3.2%) were available to download. Of those, 77% included 
      a conflict of interest disclosure, and 62% included a funding disclosure. Seven 
      percent of the articles had a registered protocol. Data sharing (2.0%) and code 
      sharing (0.1%) were rarer. Sixteen percent of articles did not adhere to any of 
      the five transparency practices, 29% adhered to one, 48% adhered to two, 7.0% 
      adhered to three, 0.3% adhered to four, and no article adhered to all five 
      practices. Adherence to transparency practices increased over time; however, data 
      and code sharing especially remained rare. Coordinated efforts involving all 
      stakeholders are needed to change current transparency practices in dental 
      research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dental caries is the most prevalent child affliction in the world and 
      can be reduced through effective preventive interventions. To plan cost-effective 
      interventions, clear and integrated data are needed. This study has been designed 
      to overcome the lack of national trend in deciduous dental caries in Iran. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate the dental caries trend in deciduous teeth in the Iranian 
      population at different ages from 1990 to 2017. METHODS: From 1990 to 2017 a 
      literature search about dmf and its components (decayed, missed, and filled 
      tooth, abbreviated as dt, mt, and ft) as well as dental caries was done in the 
      Iranian population in three English (PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus) and 
      three national databases (in Persian). All eligible national oral health surveys 
      in these 28 years were included. National dmft data were categorised based on age 
      (1-4, 5-9, and 10-14), sex, province and year. The final trends were estimated 
      using an age-spatio-temporal hierarchical model. We used the bootstrap method in 
      multilevel models to predict the uncertainty interval (UI) of the modelled 
      results. Finally, the estimations of dmft, dt, mt, and ft with a 95% UI were 
      reported from 1990 to 2017. RESULTS: Almost 22% of the Iranian deciduous teeth 
      were involved with dental caries in 1990 [dmft = 4.37; (95% UI 2.23, 6.62)] which 
      more than 83% of it was dt [3.64 (1.53, 5.88)] and less than 7% was ft [0.30 
      (0.06, 0.65)]. During 1990-2017, dmft increased by more than 15% [in 2017, 
      dmft = 5.03 (2.82, 7.29)]. The highest increase was seen in dt which was more 
      than 17% [in 2017, dt = 4.27 (1.96, 6.57)]. CONCLUSION: Increasing dental caries 
      among Iranian children over 28 years shows that oral health policies in Iran need 
      critical evaluation. We need cost-effective nationwide interventions (e.g., 
      supervised tooth brushing and improving dietary habits) and training 
      well-experienced intermediate manpower (e.g., dental hygienists) to reduce dental 
      caries.

AB  - Nosocomial myiasis is a rare event that has a higher incidence in the hospitals 
      of poor and developing countries. The presence of nosocomial myiasis reflects the 
      need for improved medical facilities and increased awareness among healthcare 
      personnel. Severely ill patients are more susceptible, such as those with 
      impaired consciousness, paralysis, and underlying diseases. The two cases here in 
      described represent the first report of nosocomial myiasis in the Kurdistan 
      Province, in Western Iran and one of them is the first report of myiasis 
      involving a COVID-19-infected patient. The causal agent was Lucilia sericata. The 
      taxonomical identification of the larvae of the second and third instar was based 
      on the morphology of the cephaloskeleton, anterior spiracles, and peritreme 
      plaques.

TI  - Assessing Google Searches for Toothache during COVID-19 Lockdowns.
PG  - 36
LID - 10.47176/mjiri.37.36 [doi]
LID - 36
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lockdowns due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic 
      forced many dental offices to be closed. This study aims to investigate the 
      association between COVID-19 imposed lockdowns and online searches for toothache 
      using Google Trends (GT). METHODS: We investigated GT online searches for the 
      term "toothache" within the past 5 years. The time frame for data gathering was 
      considered as the initiation and end dates of national/regional lockdowns in each 
      country. We used 1-way analysis of variance to identify statistical differences 
      in relative search volumes (RSVs) between 2020 and 2016-2019 for each country. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 16 countries were included in our analyses. Among all 
      countries, Indonesia (n = 100), Jamaica (n = 56), Philippines (n = 56), Iran (n = 
      52), and Turkey (47) had the highest RSVs for toothache in the specified period. 
      Compared with the previous 4 years, higher RSVs were seen in the world (as a 
      whole) (2020 RSVs, 94.4; vs 2019 RSVs, 77.8 [ P < 0.001]) and 13 countries (81.3% 
      of the included countries). CONCLUSION: Generally, searching for the term 
      "toothache" showed an increase during the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020 compared 
      with the past 4 years. This can imply the importance of dental care as urgent 
      medical care during public health emergencies such as COVID-19.

AB  - STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Zirconia can be used either monolithically or veneered with 
      porcelain. However, whether veneering zirconia affects marginal fit is unclear. 
      PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the marginal fit of 
      the monolithic and layered zirconia prostheses using 2 different assessment 
      methods. MATERIAL AND METHODS: An ideal complete crown with a chamfer finish line 
      was prepared on an extracted maxillary central incisor. Two prosthesis designs, a 
      framework and a monolithic design, and 2 marginal fit evaluation methods, the 
      silicone replica and the triple scanning techniques, were used. In the first 
      group, 10 crowns were fabricated with the framework design followed by porcelain 
      veneering, and 10 crowns were fabricated monolithically in the second group. The 
      marginal gap in each group was evaluated with both the silicone replica and 
      triple scan methods. Data were statistically analyzed with a 2-way repeated 
      measures ANOVA (alpha=.05). RESULTS: A significant difference was found in the mean 
      marginal gap by design type (P=.003), with the monolithic prostheses having lower 
      mean marginal gaps (31.0 and 84.0 microm). However, both groups showed clinically 
      acceptable marginal fit. No significant difference was found between the 
      assessment methods (P=.092). CONCLUSIONS: Monolithic zirconia crowns had a better 
      marginal fit than veneered zirconia frameworks. Both the replica and triple scan 
      techniques for marginal gap assessment yielded similar results.

LID - e0288406
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the adherence to five transparency practices (data 
      availability, code availability, protocol registration and conflicts of interest 
      (COI), and funding disclosures) from open access Coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) related articles. METHODS: We searched and exported all open access 
      COVID-19-related articles from PubMed-indexed journals in the Europe PubMed 
      Central database published from January 2020 to June 9, 2022. With a validated 
      and automated tool, we detected transparent practices of three paper types: 
      research articles, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and reviews. Basic 
      journal- and article-related information were retrieved from the database. We 
      used R for the descriptive analyses. RESULTS: The total number of articles was 
      258,678, of which we were able to retrieve full texts of 186,157 (72%) articles 
      from the database Over half of the papers (55.7%, n = 103,732) were research 
      articles, 10.9% (n = 20,229) were review articles, and less than one percent (n = 
      1,202) were RCTs. Approximately nine-tenths of articles (in all three paper 
      types) had a statement to disclose COI. Funding disclosure (83.9%, confidence 
      interval (CI): 81.7-85.8 95%) and protocol registration (53.5%, 95% CI: 
      50.7-56.3) were more frequent in RCTs than in reviews or research articles. 
      Reviews shared data (2.5%, 95% CI: 2.3-2.8) and code (0.4%, 95% CI: 0.4-0.5) less 
      frequently than RCTs or research articles. Articles published in 2022 had the 
      highest adherence to all five transparency practices. Most of the reviews (62%) 
      and research articles (58%) adhered to two transparency practices, whereas almost 
      half of the RCTs (47%) adhered to three practices. There were journal- and 
      publisher-related differences in all five practices, and articles that did not 
      adhere to transparency practices were more likely published in lowest impact 
      journals and were less likely cited. CONCLUSION: While most articles were freely 
      available and had a COI disclosure, adherence to other transparent practices was 
      far from acceptable. A much stronger commitment to open science practices, 
      particularly to protocol registration, data and code sharing, is needed from all 
      stakeholders.

TI  - Neonate, Infant, and Child Mortality by Cause in Provinces of Iran: An Analysis 
      for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
PG  - 484-495
LID - 10.34172/aim.2022.80 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since 1990, neonatal, infant, and child mortality has substantially 
      decreased in Iran. However, estimates for mortality by cause at subnational scale 
      are not available. METHODS: This study is part of the Global Burden of Diseases, 
      Injuries, and Risk Factors study (GBD) 2019. Here we report the number and rates 
      of neonate, infant, and child deaths by cause across provinces of Iran from 1990 
      to 2019. RESULTS: Between 1990 and 2019, the neonatal mortality rate per 1000 
      live births decreased from 31.8 (95% UI: 28.1-35.5) to 6.8 (6.1-7.4). The child 
      mortality rates decreased from 71.2 (63.6-79.1) to 11.1 (10.2-12.0) per 1000 live 
      births. Mortality rates among neonates per 1000 live births ranged from 3.1 
      (2.6-3.7) to 10.0 (9.2-10.8) across provinces in 2019. Child mortality rate per 
      1000 live births ranged from 5.5 (4.6-6.5) to 17.9 (16.4-19.4) across provinces 
      in 2019. Neonatal disorders, congenital birth defects, and lower respiratory 
      infections were the three main causes of mortality in almost all provinces of 
      Iran. The majority of neonatal disorders were due to neonatal preterm birth and 
      neonatal asphyxia, trauma, and infections. The trends of mortality across 
      provinces from 1990 to 2019 were converging and decreased along with increase in 
      sociodemographic index (SDI). CONCLUSION: All provinces achieved the Sustainable 
      Development Goal 3.2 of neonatal mortality less than 12 and child mortality less 
      than 25 per 1000 live births. However, disparities still exist across provinces, 
      specifically in low-SDI provinces.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are currently no integrated data on the trend of dental caries 
      amongst distinct age groups in Iran. We aimed to assess the national and 
      subnational trend of dental caries of permanent teeth in Iran from 1990 to 2017. 
      METHODS: A literature search about dental caries and the decayed-missing-filled 
      teeth index (DMFT) was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and 3 
      national databases (in Persian). All eligible national oral health surveys in 
      these 28 years were included. We categorised and aggregated the DMFT values and 
      their components based on age (5-year-based groups from 5 to 9 to 60+ years), 
      sex, year, and province. The data for missing spots were estimated using the 
      spatiotemporal Bayesian hierarchical model. We used the bootstrap method in 
      multilevel models to predict the uncertainty interval (UI) of the modelled 
      results. RESULTS: Nationally, the all-ages mean DMFT increased by nearly 58.0% 
      (6.8 [95% UI, 4.1-10.5] in 1990 to 10.8 [95% UI, 7.5-14.5] in 2017). Decayed 
      teeth (DT) and missing teeth (MT) rose by 84.5% and 31.6% during this period, 
      respectively. Filled teeth (FT) showed almost a 2.6-fold increase in the same 
      period from 0.6 (95% UI, 0.01-1.6) in 1990 to 1.7 (95% UI, 0.6-2.8) in 2017. The 
      proportion of DT and FT continuously increased in both sexes. In 2017, the 
      highest DT, MT, and FT were estimated in the 25-29 (4.9 [95% UI, 2.5-7.2]), 60+ 
      (21.5 [95% UI, 17.5-25.4]), and 35-39 (2.6 [95% UI, 1.3-4.0]) year age groups. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Caries of permanent dentition levies a growing burden on the Iranian 
      population. Considering the continuous increase in caries during the 1990-2017 
      period, Iranian policymakers should pay heed to these findings and react more 
      proactively to mitigate this perpetuating issue. Implementing nationwide 
      interventions such as sugar consumption management should be encouraged to 
      achieve sustainable outcomes in this regards.

TI  - Nasopharyngeal Branchial Cyst and Thornwaldt Cyst in a Patient with Hearing Loss 
      after Coronavirus Infection.
PG  - 289-293

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The majority of nasopharyngeal cysts are asymptomatic and rare. 
      Nevertheless, these lesions are rarely discovered during regular endoscopies and 
      imaging tests. An upper nasopharyngeal Thornwaldt cyst is a benign, mucosal 
      congenital cyst. Even less frequently, they can cause unexplained sinonasal 
      symptoms such as rhinorrhea, vision problems, and nasal blockage. CASE REPORT: 
      Here, we report a case with new-onset hearing loss after the coronavirus 
      infection, in which his imaging investigation showed a nasopharyngeal mass. 
      CONCLUSION: After covid-19 infection we should consider branchial Cyst and 
      Thornwaldt Cyst in a high-risk patients. On the other hand, the progressive 
      hearing loss after covid-19 can occur due to activation of this kind of cysts.

TI  - Global, regional, and national burden and quality of care index (QCI) of oral 
      disorders: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 1990-2017.
PG  - 116
LID - 10.1186/s12903-023-03808-z [doi]
LID - 116
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oral disorders are still a major global public health challenge, 
      considering their perpetuating and chronic nature. Currently, there is no direct 
      index to measure the quality of care on a population scale. Hence, we aim to 
      propose a new index to measure the quality of care for oral disorders worldwide. 
      METHODS: We generated our database using the data from the Global Burden of 
      Disease (GBD) study 2017. Among different variables such as prevalence, 
      incidence, years lived with disability, and disability-adjusted life years, we 
      utilised principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the component that bears 
      the greatest proportion of information to generate the novel quality of care 
      index (QCI) for oral disorders. RESULTS: Global QCI for oral disorders gradually 
      increased from 1990 to 2017 (from 70.5 to 74.6). No significant gender disparity 
      was observed during this period, and the gender disparity ratio (GDR) was 
      considered optimal in 1990 and 2017. Between 1990 and 2017, the age-standardised 
      QCI for all oral disorders increased in all the SDI regions. The highest QCI for 
      all oral disorders in 2017 belonged to high-middle SDI countries (=80.24), and 
      the lowest YLDs rate was seen in the low SDI quintile. In 1990, the quality of 
      care in European, Central Asian, and Central and South American countries was in 
      the lowest quintiles, whereas the North American, East Asian, Middle Eastern, and 
      some African countries had the highest quality of dental care. Maynmar (=100), 
      Uganda (=92.5), Taiwan (=92.0), China (=92.5), and the United States (=89.2) were 
      the five countries with the highest age-standardised QCI. Nicaragua (=41.3), 
      Belgium (=40.2), Venezuela (=38.4), Sierra Leone (=30.5), and the Gambia (=30.3) 
      were the five countries with the least age-standardised QCI values. CONCLUSION: 
      The quality of care for all oral disorders showed an increasing trend on a global 
      scale from 1990 to 2017. However, the QCI distribution was not homogenous among 
      various regions. To prevent the exacerbation of imminent disparities in this 
      regard, better attention to total tooth loss in high-income countries and 
      prioritising primary healthcare provision in low-income countries are recommended 
      for oral disorders.

TI  - Dental Caries among the Elderly in Iran: A Meta-analysis.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.47176/mjiri.38.11 [doi]
LID - 11
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of dental caries among the elderly is high worldwide, 
      and dental caries cause the major burden of oral diseases. This meta-analysis 
      aimed to determine the dental caries experience among the elderly in Iran. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of the published and grey literature on Iranians 
      aged 65 years or older was performed. Six international and local databases 
      provided the most comprehensive population-based studies. National oral health 
      surveys and national disease and health surveys were considered other primary 
      data sources. The quality of remained studies was assessed by a modified tool 
      designed based on the STROBE statement checklist to evaluate the cross-sectional 
      studies. R Version 3.6.0 was used for statistical analysis. Heterogeneity was 
      assessed using Cochran's Q and F statistics. Subgroup analysis was performed to 
      detect the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plots and Egger's regression intercept 
      test were used to assess publication bias and selective reporting. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 3099 sources were found. After excluding ineligible studies, 46 data 
      points with 10411 people >/=65 years were included in the meta-analysis. The mean 
      pooled decayed, missing, and filled teeth (DMFT) among older people was 26.84 
      (range, 26.41-27.28). The DMFT was 26.78 (range, 26.12-27.43) in women and 26.91 
      (range, 26.32-27.50) in men. The mean number of decayed teeth was 1.48 (range, 
      1.32-1.65). The mean pooled missing teeth was 24.83 (range, 24.20-25.46), and the 
      mean pooled filled teeth was 0.14 (range, 0.12-0.17). The majority (92%) of the 
      DMFT was related to missing teeth. CONCLUSION: Iranian elderly have almost 5 
      sound teeth in their mouth on average. The Iranian oral health policymakers 
      should address this considerable burden of dental caries in designing and 
      implementing better oral health policies for the population, especially older 
      Iranian adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for 
      chronic knee pain secondary to osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, 
      EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central to September 2023 for trials that (1) 
      enrolled patients with chronic pain associated with knee OA, and (2) randomized 
      them to MSC therapy vs. placebo or usual care. We performed random-effects 
      meta-analysis and used Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and 
      Evaluation to assess the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We included 16 trials 
      (807 participants). At 3-6 months, MSC therapy probably results in little to no 
      difference in pain relief (weighted mean difference [WMD] -0.74 cm on a 10 cm 
      visual analog scale [VAS], 95% confidence interval [95%CI] -1.16 to -0.33; 
      minimally important difference [MID] 1.5 cm) or physical functioning (WMD 2.23 
      points on 100-point 36-item Short Form Survey (SF-36) physical functioning 
      subscale, 95%CI -0.97 to 5.43; MID 10-points; both moderate certainty). At 12 
      months, injection of MSCs probably results in little to no difference in pain 
      (WMD -0.73 cm on a 10 cm VAS, 95%CI -1.69 to 0.24; moderate certainty) and may 
      improve physical functioning (WMD 19.36 points on 100-point SF-36 PF subscale, 
      95%CI -0.19 to 38.9; low certainty). MSC therapy may increase risk of any adverse 
      events (risk ratio [RR] 2.67, 95%CI 1.19 to 5.99; low certainty) and pain and 
      swelling of the knee joint (RR 1.58, 95%CI 1.04 to 2.38; low certainty). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Intra-articular injection of MSCs for chronic knee pain associated 
      with OA probably provides little to no improvement in pain or physical function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on gender inequality is crucial as it unveils the pervasive 
      disparities that persist across various domains, shedding light on societal 
      imbalances and providing a foundation for informed policy-making. AIM: To 
      investigate gender differences in scientometric indices among faculty members in 
      dental schools across Iran. This included overall data and speciality-specific 
      data. METHODS: The publication profiles of academic staff in all dental schools 
      were examined using the Iranian Scientometric Information Database (ISID, 
      http://isid.research.ac.ir). Variables analyzed were working field, academic 
      degree, the total number of papers, papers per year, total number of citations, 
      percentage of self-citation, h-index, g-index, citations per paper, gender, 
      university type, number of years publishing, proportion of international papers, 
      first-author papers, and corresponding-author papers. Mann-Whitney and 
      Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests were used to analyze the relationship between 
      background characteristics and scientometric indicators. The extracted data were 
      analyzed using R v4.0.1. RESULTS: The database included 1850 faculty members, of 
      which about 60% (1104 of 1850) were women. Men (n = 746) had a higher number of 
      papers (6583 vs. 6255) and citations (60410 vs. 39559) compared with women; 234 
      of the 376 faculty members with no papers were women. Almost half of the women (N 
      = 517 of 1104) were in Type 2 universities, and nearly half of the men (N = 361 
      of the 746) were faculty members at Type 1 universities (Type 1 universities 
      ranking higher than Type 2 and 3 universities). The medians of scientometric 
      indices were higher in men, except for self-citation percentage (0 (IQR = 2) vs. 
      0 (IQR = 3), P = 0.083), international papers percentage (0 (IQR = 7.5) vs. 0 
      (IQR = 16.7), P<0.001). The proportion of corresponding-author papers was more 
      than 62% higher in women (25 (IQR = 50) vs. 15.4 (IQR = 40), P<0.001). Men had a 
      two-fold higher median h-index (2 (IQR = 4) vs. 1 (IQR = 3), P<0.001). 
      Restorative dentistry and pediatric dentistry had the highest men-to-women ratios 
      (1.5 for both). Dental materials and oral and maxillofacial surgery showed the 
      lowest men-to-women ratios (0.42 and 0.5, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Women made 
      up the majority of dental faculty members in Iran. Nevertheless, men showed 
      better scientometric results in several significant indices. Having identified 
      scientometric information reflecting differences across faculty members, further 
      research is now needed to better understand the drivers of these differences.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the magnitude and shape of the relationship between 
      dental caries experience and the source of oral health information in England. 
      METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study using the Child Dental Health Survey 
      2013 in England. Using a negative binomial model, the relationship between the 
      number of decayed, missing, filled teeth (DMFT) of 12- and 15-year-old students 
      and their primary source of oral health information was assessed. The sources of 
      oral health information included parents, television, newspapers, the Internet, 
      and social media. The adjusted model included age, sex, and the Index of Multiple 
      Deprivation (IMD). R was used for data handling, analysis and reporting. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 2,372 children were assessed (48.7% female, 48.6% 12-year-old). For the 
      majority, the primary source of oral health information was their parents (89.5%) 
      followed by the Internet (43.4%). Over nine-tenth of the participants had a DMFT 
      = 0. The adjusted model showed that the prevalence rate of DMFT for the children 
      whose primary source of information is their parents (0.45) or television (0.62) 
      is lower than 1. The prevalence rate for the Internet (1.17) and social media 
      (1.67) was higher than 1, but they were removed from the final model due to being 
      non-statistically significant. Age and deprivation had a direct relationship with 
      the prevalence rate of DMFT, meaning that 15-year-olds and children from more 
      deprived areas had a higher prevalence rate of DMFT. CONCLUSION: Children whose 
      primary source of oral health information was their parents or television had a 
      lower DMFT. On the contrary, using the Internet or social media as the source of 
      oral health information was associated with higher caries experience among 
      schoolchildren.

TI  - Publicly Available Dental Image Datasets for Artificial Intelligence.
PG  - 1365-1374
LID - 10.1177/00220345241272052 [doi]
AB  - The development of artificial intelligence (AI) in dentistry requires large and 
      well-annotated datasets. However, the availability of public dental imaging 
      datasets remains unclear. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of 
      all publicly available dental imaging datasets to address this gap and support AI 
      development. This observational study searched all publicly available dataset 
      resources (academic databases, preprints, and AI challenges), focusing on 
      datasets/articles from 2020 to 2023, with PubMed searches extending back to 2011. 
      We comprehensively searched for dental AI datasets containing images (intraoral 
      photos, scans, radiographs, etc.) using relevant keywords. We included datasets 
      of >50 images obtained from publicly available sources. We extracted dataset 
      characteristics, patient demographics, country of origin, dataset size, ethical 
      clearance, image details, FAIRness metrics, and metadata completeness. We 
      screened 131,028 records and extracted 16 unique dental imaging datasets. The 
      datasets were obtained from Kaggle (18.8%), GitHub, Google, Mendeley, PubMed, 
      Zenodo (each 12.5%), Grand-Challenge, OSF, and arXiv (each 6.25%). The primary 
      focus was tooth segmentation (62.5%) and labeling (56.2%). Panoramic radiography 
      was the most common imaging modality (58.8%). Of the 13 countries, China 
      contributed the most images (2,413). Of the datasets, 75% contained annotations, 
      whereas the methods used to establish labels were often unclear and inconsistent. 
      Only 31.2% of the datasets reported ethical approval, and 56.25% did not specify 
      a license. Most data were obtained from dental clinics (50%). Intraoral 
      radiographs had the highest findability score in the FAIR assessment, whereas 
      cone-beam computed tomography datasets scored the lowest in all categories. These 
      findings revealed a scarcity of publicly available imaging dental data and 
      inconsistent metadata reporting. To promote the development of robust, equitable, 
      and generalizable AI tools for dental diagnostics, treatment, and research, 
      efforts are needed to address data scarcity, increase diversity, mandate metadata 
      completeness, and ensure FAIRness in AI dental imaging research.

TI  - Reevaluating antibiotic prophylaxis: insights from a network meta-analysis on dry 
      socket and surgical site infections.
PG  - 178-179
LID - 10.1038/s41432-024-01067-7 [doi]
AB  - DATA SOURCES: Three databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus) were 
      searched in December 2021 for 16 Randomised Clinical Trials (RCTs). STUDY 
      SELECTION: Three reviewers reviewed the articles on oral antibiotic prophylaxis 
      (ABP) for the prevention of surgical site infection (SSI) and dry socket (DS) 
      after lower third molar (L3M) extraction using the PICO framework. From 1999 to 
      2021, RCTs involving healthy patients undergoing L3M extraction with ABP, 
      placebo, or no therapy were included. Adverse effects (AEs) associated with 
      antibiotic usage, along with the main outcomes (DS and SSI), were also 
      documented. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Three independent investigators 
      selected articles based on pre-established inclusion criteria, with any 
      disagreements resolved by consensus or additional researchers. PRISMA guidelines 
      were followed, involving initial title and abstract screening, followed by 
      full-text evaluation. Exclusion reasons were documented, and the most recent 
      report was included when multiple reports on the same patients were found, with 
      no language restrictions applied. Two investigators evaluated studies quality and 
      quality of evidence respectively using the Cochrane Collaboration tool and 
      GRADEpro GDT. They independently extracted data, focusing on the type of 
      extraction and the number of extracted L3M. They also detailed the use of 
      antibiotics, including dosage, dosage regimen, timing, and duration. Among 16 
      articles, 15 used a parallel arm design, while one used a crossover design. The 
      antibiotics studied included Amoxicillin+Clavulanic acid (7 articles), 
      Amoxicillin (6), Metronidazole (2), Azithromycin (1), and Clindamycin (2), all 
      compared with no treatment or placebo. A pairwise meta-analysis was used to 
      combine studies with equivalent treatment (direct estimation), and a network 
      meta-analysis compared outcome variables across different treatments (indirect 
      comparison). RESULTS: Two included articles had a low risk of bias and the level 
      of evidence was low according to GRADE. Pooled results supported the use of 
      antibiotics to reduce DS and SSI following L3M extraction with a number needed to 
      treat 25 and 18, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the fact that ABP reduces the 
      risk of DS and SSI, it is recommended to consider systemic conditions and 
      individual patient risk factors before prescribing antibiotics, due to global 
      health threat.

TI  - COVID-19-related research data availability and quality according to the FAIR 
      principles: A meta-research study.
PG  - e0313991

LID - e0313991
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, 
      Interoperable, and Reusable), scientific research data should be findable, 
      accessible, interoperable, and reusable. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to massive 
      research activities and an unprecedented number of topical publications in a 
      short time. However, no evaluation has assessed whether this COVID-19-related 
      research data has complied with FAIR principles (or FAIRness). OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objective was to investigate the availability of open data in COVID-19-related 
      research and to assess compliance with FAIRness. METHODS: We conducted a 
      comprehensive search and retrieved all open-access articles related to COVID-19 
      from journals indexed in PubMed, available in the Europe PubMed Central database, 
      published from January 2020 through June 2023, using the metareadr package. Using 
      rtransparent, a validated automated tool, we identified articles with links to 
      their raw data hosted in a public repository. We then screened the link and 
      included those repositories that included data specifically for their pertaining 
      paper. Subsequently, we automatically assessed the adherence of the repositories 
      to the FAIR principles using FAIRsFAIR Research Data Object Assessment Service 
      (F-UJI) and rfuji package. The FAIR scores ranged from 1-22 and had four 
      components. We reported descriptive analysis for each article type, journal 
      category, and repository. We used linear regression models to find the most 
      influential factors on the FAIRness of data. RESULTS: 5,700 URLs were included in 
      the final analysis, sharing their data in a general-purpose repository. The mean 
      (standard deviation, SD) level of compliance with FAIR metrics was 9.4 (4.88). 
      The percentages of moderate or advanced compliance were as follows: Findability: 
      100.0%, Accessibility: 21.5%, Interoperability: 46.7%, and Reusability: 61.3%. 
      The overall and component-wise monthly trends were consistent over the follow-up. 
      Reviews (9.80, SD = 5.06, n = 160), articles in dental journals (13.67, SD = 
      3.51, n = 3) and Harvard Dataverse (15.79, SD = 3.65, n = 244) had the highest 
      mean FAIRness scores, whereas letters (7.83, SD = 4.30, n = 55), articles in 
      neuroscience journals (8.16, SD = 3.73, n = 63), and those deposited in GitHub 
      (4.50, SD = 0.13, n = 2,152) showed the lowest scores. Regression models showed 
      that the repository was the most influential factor on FAIRness scores (R2 = 
      0.809). CONCLUSION: This paper underscored the potential for improvement across 
      all facets of FAIR principles, specifically emphasizing Interoperability and 
      Reusability in the data shared within general repositories during the COVID-19 
      pandemic.

      of orofacial clefts: Global burden of disease systematic analysis 1990-2019.
PG  - e0317267

AB  - BACKGROUND: Orofacial clefts are the most common craniofacial anomalies that 
      include a variety of conditions affecting the lips and oral cavity. They remain a 
      significant global public health challenge. Despite this, the quality of care for 
      orofacial clefts has not been investigated at global and country levels. 
      OBJECTIVE: We aimed to measure the quality-of-care index (QCI) for orofacial 
      clefts worldwide. METHODS: We used the 2019 Global Burden of Disease data to 
      create a multifactorial index (QCI) to assess orofacial clefts globally and 
      nationally. By utilizing data on incidence, prevalence, years of life lost, and 
      years lived with disability, we defined four ratios to indirectly reflect the 
      quality of healthcare. Subsequently, we conducted a principal component analysis 
      to identify the most critical variables that could account for the observed 
      variability. The outcome of this analysis was defined as the QCI for orofacial 
      clefts. Following this, we tracked the QCI trends among males and females 
      worldwide across various regions and countries, considering factors such as the 
      socio-demographic index and World Bank classifications. RESULTS: Globally, the 
      QCI for orofacial clefts exhibited a consistent upward trend from 1990 to 2019 
      (66.4 to 90.2) overall and for females (82.9 to 94.3) and males (72.8 to 93.6). 
      In the year 2019, the top five countries with the highest QCI scores were as 
      follows: Norway (QCI = 99.9), Ireland (99.4), France (99.4), Germany (99.3), the 
      Netherlands (99.3), and Malta (99.3). Conversely, the five countries with the 
      lowest QCI scores on a global scale in 2019 were Somalia (59.1), Niger (67.6), 
      Burkina Faso (72.6), Ethiopia (73.0), and Mali (74.4). Gender difference showed a 
      converging trend from 1990 to 2019 (optimal gender disparity ratio (GDR): 123 vs. 
      163 countries), and the GDR showed a move toward optimization (between 0.95 and 
      1.05) in the better and worse parts of the world. CONCLUSION: Despite the 
      positive results regarding the QCI for orofacial clefts worldwide, some countries 
      showed a slight negative trend.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to examine the distribution of country, 
      region, language, and gender diversity in the authorship of Cochrane reviews and 
      compare it to non-Cochrane systematic reviews. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We 
      retrieved all published articles from the Cochrane Library (until November 6, 
      2023) using a web crawling technique that extracted prespecified data fields, 
      including publication date, review category, and author affiliations. For 
      comparison, non-Cochrane systematic reviews were identified through PubMed using 
      E-utility calls. We determined the country, region of affiliations and gender of 
      the first, corresponding, and last authors for Cochrane reviews; the same fields 
      were determined for first authors only for non-Cochrane reviews due to data 
      availability. Trends in geographical and gender diversity over time were 
      evaluated using logistic regression. Fisher's exact test was used for 
      comparisons. Diversity trends between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews were 
      explored through visual presentation, Pearson's product-moment correlation, and 
      the Granger Causality Test. RESULTS: This comprehensive analysis included 22,681 
      Cochrane reviews and 224,484 non-Cochrane reviews. Cochrane reviews showed 
      increasing diversity in several areas: representation of first authors from 
      non-English speaking countries rose substantially (from 16.7% in 1996 to 42.8% in 
      2023), and female first authorship more than tripled (from 15.0% in 1996 to 55.6% 
      in 2023). Representation from lower-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) in 
      Cochrane reviews has declined recently (from a peak of 23.2% in 2012 to 18.4% in 
      2023). Among Cochrane Review Groups, diversity varied notably, with Sexually 
      Transmitted Infections achieving the highest representation from LMICs (68.1% of 
      first authors). In 2023, non-Cochrane reviews showed higher representation from 
      non-English speaking countries (56.9%) and LMICs (50.8%) compared to Cochrane 
      reviews. The patterns of gender diversity between Cochrane and non-Cochrane 
      reviews showed strong correlations for female first authorship (r = 0.829, P < 
      .001), suggesting parallel evolution over time. CONCLUSION: Both Cochrane and 
      non-Cochrane reviews demonstrate important progress in author diversity, 
      particularly in gender representation and inclusion of authors from non-English 
      speaking countries. While non-Cochrane reviews show stronger representation from 
      LMICs, both review sources reflect the evolving landscape of global evidence 
      synthesis.
