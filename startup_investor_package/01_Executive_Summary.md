# Executive Summary
**FacultyFinder.io - AI-Powered Academic Intelligence Platform**

---

## Company Overview
**FacultyFinder.io** is a cutting-edge EdTech and research intelligence company that has built the world's most comprehensive AI-powered academic faculty database. Founded in 2024 by Dr. Ahmad Sofi-Mahmudi, we are revolutionizing academic recruitment, research collaboration, and higher education intelligence through advanced AI and automated data systems.

## The Problem
The global higher education and research recruitment sector faces critical inefficiencies:
