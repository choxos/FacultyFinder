# Faculty PubMed Search System - Dual Strategy

## 🎯 **Enhanced Dual Search Approach!**

The system now implements **two complementary search strategies** for each faculty member:

1. **All Publications**: Finds all career publications by the author
2. **Current Affiliation**: Finds publications specifically at their current university

This gives you **comprehensive vs. institution-specific** publication data!

## 📊 **What the Updated System Does**

The enhanced `pubmed_faculty_searcher.py` script:
- ✅ **Loads 281 faculty** from your CSV file automatically
- ✅ **Uses proper university folder structure** (`data/publications/pubmed/CA/ON/CA-ON-002_mcmaster.ca/`)
- ✅ **Removes quotations** from author searches (as you requested)
- ✅ **Runs dual searches** per faculty member:
  - `Julia Abelson[Author]` (all career publications)
  - `Julia Abelson[Author] AND McMaster University[Affiliation]` (current institution only)
- ✅ **Creates 2 files per faculty** with different publication sets
- ✅ **Intelligent query selection** (automatically picks the query with most results)
- ✅ **Detailed progress tracking** for both search types

## 🧠 **Dual Search Strategy**

### **For Each Faculty Member:**

#### **All Publications Search:**
1. `Julia Abelson[Author]`
2. `Abelson J[Author]` 
3. `Julia Abelson[Author]`

#### **Current Affiliation Search:**
1. `Julia Abelson[Author] AND McMaster University[Affiliation]`
2. `Abelson J[Author] AND McMaster University[Affiliation]`
3. `Julia Abelson[Author] AND McMaster University[Affiliation]`

**System automatically uses the query that finds the MOST publications for each search type.**

## 📁 **Enhanced File Organization**

Creates **2 files per faculty member**:

```
data/publications/pubmed/CA/ON/CA-ON-002_mcmaster.ca/
├── Julia_Abelson_all_publications.txt (604 publications - entire career)
├── Julia_Abelson_current_affiliation.txt (106 publications - at McMaster)
├── Muhammad_Afzal_all_publications.txt (1622 publications - entire career)
├── Muhammad_Afzal_current_affiliation.txt (8 publications - at McMaster)
└── ... (2 files × 281 faculty = 562 total files)
```

## 📊 **Real Test Results**

From 2 faculty members tested:

### **Julia Abelson**
- **All publications**: 604 (entire career)
- **McMaster publications**: 106 (current affiliation)
- **Ratio**: 17.5% of publications are at McMaster

### **Muhammad Afzal**  
- **All publications**: 1622 (entire career)
- **McMaster publications**: 8 (current affiliation)
- **Ratio**: 0.5% of publications are at McMaster (likely new faculty)

**This data is much more valuable for analysis!**

```

## 🚨 **Updated Time Estimates**

### **Processing Times** (Dual searches take ~2x longer)
- **5 faculty**: ~1 minute (10 files)
- **50 faculty**: ~10 minutes (100 files)
- **281 faculty**: ~3-4 hours (562 files)

### **File Counts**
- **Traditional approach**: 281 files
- **New dual approach**: 562 files (2 per faculty)
- **Storage**: ~2-3x more data (comprehensive coverage)

## 🎉 **Database Integration**

The parsing and import system will automatically handle both file types:

### **All Publications Table**
- Complete career publication history

The dual approach reveals important patterns:
- **Established faculty**: Higher current affiliation ratios
- **New recruits**: Lower current affiliation ratios  
- **Institutional impact**: Publications specifically at McMaster
- **Career trajectory**: Total academic output across institutions

This data is invaluable for **faculty evaluation, recruitment decisions, and institutional research metrics**.
