## Output Structure

### Publication JSON Files
Each publication is saved as an individual JSON file containing comprehensive metadata extracted from PubMed XML:

**Location**: `data/publications/pubmed/[pmid].json`

### Faculty Tracking CSVs
Each faculty member gets a tracking CSV that links them to their publications:

**Location**: `data/faculties/[country]/[province]/[university_code_website]/publications/[faculty_id].csv`

**Important**: The folder naming follows the pattern `university_code_website` (e.g., `CA-ON-002_mcmaster.ca`), where:
- `university_code`: From the universities CSV (e.g., CA-ON-002) 
- `website`: From the universities CSV (e.g., mcmaster.ca)

Example path: `data/faculties/CA/ON/CA-ON-002_mcmaster.ca/publications/CA-ON-002-00001.csv`

**CSV Format**:
```csv
pmid,current_affiliation
34567890,TRUE
34567891,FALSE
34567892,TRUE
```

**Affiliation Status**:
- `TRUE`: Publication found in both author-only AND author+affiliation searches (current institution)
- `FALSE`: Publication found only in author-only search (likely from previous affiliation)
