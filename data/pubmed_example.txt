TI  - Understanding the Conceptualization and Operationalization of Trauma-Informed 
      Care Within and Across Systems: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis.
PG  - 785-853
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12579 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points In order to achieve successful operationalization of 
      trauma-informed care (TIC), TIC policies must include conceptual clarity 
      regarding the definition of both trauma and TIC. Furthermore, TIC requires clear 
      and cohesive policies that address operational factors such as clearly delineated 
      roles of service providers, protocol for positive trauma screens, necessary 
      financial infrastructure, and mechanisms of intersectoral collaboration. 
      Additionally, policy procedures need to be considered for how TIC is provided at 
      the program and service level as well as what TIC means at the organizational, 
      system, and intersectoral level. CONTEXT: Increased recognition of the 
      epidemiology of trauma and its impact on individuals within and across human 
      service delivery systems has contributed to the development of trauma-informed 
      care (TIC). How TIC can be conceptualized and implemented, however, remains 
      unclear. This study seeks to review and analyze the TIC literature from within 
      and across systems of care and to generate a conceptual framework regarding TIC. 
      METHODS: Our study followed a critical interpretive synthesis methodology. We 
      searched multiple databases (Campbell Collaboration, Econlit, Health Systems 
      Evidence, Embase, ERIC, HealthSTAR, IPSA, JSTOR, Medline, PsychINFO, Social 
      Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science),as well as 
      relevant gray literature and information-rich websites. We used a coding tool, 
      adapted to the TIC literature, for data extraction. FINDINGS: Electronic database 
      searches yielded 2,439 results and after inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
      applied, a purposive sample of 98 information-rich articles was generated. 
      Conceptual clarity and definitional understanding of TIC is lacking in the 
      literature, which has led to poor operationalization of TIC. Additionally, 
      infrastructural and ideological barriers, such as insufficient funding and 
      service provider "buy-in," have hindered TIC implementation. The resulting 
      conceptual framework defines trauma and depicts critical elements of vertical 
      TIC, including the bidirectional relationship between the trauma-affected 
      individual and the system, and horizontal TIC, which requires intersectoral 
      collaboration, an established referral network, and standardized TIC language. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Successful operationalization of TIC requires policies that address 
      current gaps in systems arrangements, such as the lack of funding structures for 
      TIC, and political factors, such as the role of policy legacies. The emergent 
      conceptual framework acknowledges critical factors affecting operationalization.

AB  - Canada has a rich history of public engagement in the health policy sector. 
      However, current political, economic and social challenges call for critical 
      reflection on this history, to assess whether current approaches to engaging 
      Canadian publics are up to the task, and what adaptations or new approaches might 
      be needed. If the persisting inequities in health systems across Canada are going 
      to be addressed, it is imperative that those designing, developing and 
      implementing policies find ways to reflect the needs and preferences of the 
      communities and populations most adversely affected by these inequities in their 
      decisions. The purpose of this special issue is to address this important topic 
      through a series of research papers and commentaries. Our work is targeted to 
      health policy makers across Canada who are seeking to engage with various publics 
      on a wide array of health policy issues. We offer key insights into what more 
      purposeful and equitable public engagement might look like, as well as common 
      pitfalls in public engagement practices and how they can be avoided.

TI  - Was priority setting included in the Canadian COVID-19 pandemic planning and 
      preparedness? A comparative analysis of COVID-19 pandemic plans from eight 
      provinces and three territories.
PG  - 104817
LID - S0168-8510(23)00102-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2023.104817 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variation in priorities during pandemic planning among the federal, 
      provincial and territorial jurisdictions are thought to have impacted Canada's 
      ability to effectively control the spread of the COVID-19 virus, and protect the 
      most vulnerable. The potential influence of diverse and divergent political, 
      cultural, and behavioural factors, regarding inclusion of priority setting (PS) 
      in pandemic preparedness planning across the country is not well understood. This 
      study aimed to examine how the Canadian federal, provincial and territorial 
      COVID-19 pandemic preparedness planning documents integrated PS. METHODS: A 
      documentary analysis of the federal, eight provincial, three territorial COVID-19 
      preparedness and response plans. We assessed the degree to which the documented 
      PS processes fulfilled established quality requirements of effective PS using the 
      Kapiriri & Martin framework. RESULTS: While the federal plan included most of the 
      parameters of effective PS, the provinces and territories reflected few. The lack 
      of obligation for the provinces and territories to emulate the federal plan is 
      one of the possible reasons for the varying inclusion of these parameters. The 
      parameters included did not vary systematically with the jurisdiction's context. 
      CONCLUSION: Provinces could consider using the framework of the federal plan and 
      the WHO guidelines to guide future pandemic planning. Regular evaluation of the 
      instituted PS would provide a mechanism through which lessons can be harnessed 
      and improvement strategies developed. Future studies should describe and evaluate 
      what PS mechanisms were implemented.

      systematic review of evaluation tools.
PG  - 1075-1084
LID - 10.1111/hex.12804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts 
      remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in 
      individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and 
      health systems have been published. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and appraise 
      evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system 
      decision making. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 1980 
      and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database 
      of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey 
      literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and 
      engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the 
      evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and 
      public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. RESULTS: In total, 10 663 
      unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were 
      developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of 
      engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature 
      review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the 
      public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, 
      and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the 
      public. CONCLUSION: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support 
      patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. 
      However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed 
      could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their 
      design and reporting.

TI  - Advanced practice nursing in Canada: overview of a decision support synthesis.
PG  - 15-34
AB  - The objective of this decision support synthesis was to identify and review 
      published and grey literature and to conduct stakeholder interviews to (1) 
      describe the distinguishing characteristics of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) 
      and nurse practitioner (NP) role definitions and competencies relevant to 
      Canadian contexts, (2) identify the key barriers and facilitators for the 
      effective development and utilization of CNS and NP roles and (3) inform the 
      development of evidence-based recommendations for the individual, organizational 
      and system supports required to better integrate CNS and NP roles into the 
      Canadian healthcare system and advance the delivery of nursing and patient care 
      services in Canada. Four types of advanced practice nurses (APNs) were the focus: 
      CNSs, primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), acute care nurse 
      practitioners (ACNPs) and a blended CNS/NP role. We worked with a 
      multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional advisory board that helped identify 
      documents and key informant interviewees, develop interview questions and 
      formulate implications from our findings. We included 468 published and 
      unpublished English- and French-language papers in a scoping review of the 
      literature. We conducted interviews in English and French with 62 Canadian and 
      international key informants (APNs, healthcare administrators, policy makers, 
      nursing regulators, educators, physicians and other team members). We conducted 
      four focus groups with a total of 19 APNs, educators, administrators and policy 
      makers. A multidisciplinary roundtable convened by the Canadian Health Services 
      Research Foundation formulated evidence-informed policy and practice 
      recommendations based on the synthesis findings. This paper forms the foundation 
      for this special issue, which contains 10 papers summarizing different dimensions 
      of our synthesis. Here, we summarize the synthesis methods and the 
      recommendations formulated at the roundtable.

LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in advanced 
      health systems remain understudied. In particular, the ethical and social values 
      dimensions of health technology assessment (HTA) and drug coverage decisions for 
      children have received almost no attention in research or policy. METHODS: To 
      elicit and understand the social values that influence decision-making for public 
      funding of paediatric drugs, we undertook a series of in-depth, semi-structured 
      interviews with a stratified purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders involved 
      with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the provincial 
      (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Constructivist grounded theory 
      methodology guided data collection and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our study 
      provides empirical evidence about the unique ethical and social values dimensions 
      of HTA for children, and describes a novel social values typology for paediatric 
      drug policy decision-making. Three principal categories of values emerged from 
      stakeholder reflections on HTA and drug policy-making for children: procedural 
      values, structural values, and sociocultural values. Key findings include the 
      importance of attention to the procedural legitimacy of HTA for children, with 
      emphasis on the inclusion of child health voices in processes of technology 
      appraisal and policy uptake; a role for HTA institutions to consider the equity 
      impacts of technologies, both in setting review priorities and in assessing the 
      value of technologies for public coverage; and the potential benefits of a 
      distinct national framework to guide drug policy for children. CONCLUSION: 
      Current approaches to HTA are not well designed for the realities of child health 
      and illness, nor the societal priorities regarding children that our study 
      identified. This research generates new knowledge to inform decision-making on 
      paediatric drugs by HTA institutions and government payers in Canada and other 
      publicly-funded health systems, through insights into the relevant social values 
      for child drug funding decisions from varied stakeholder groups.

TI  - Towards conceptualizing patients as partners in health systems: a systematic 
      review and descriptive synthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the sharp increase in the involvement of patients (including 
      family and informal caregivers) as active participants, collaborators, advisors 
      and decision-makers in health systems, a new role has emerged: the patient 
      partner. The role of patient partner differs from other forms of patient 
      engagement in its longitudinal and bidirectional nature. This systematic review 
      describes extant work on how patient partners are conceptualized and engaged in 
      health systems. In doing so, it furthers the understanding of the role and 
      activities of patient partners, and best practices for future patient partnership 
      activities. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed 
      literature published in English or French that describes patient partner roles 
      between 2000 and 2021 in any country or sector of the health system. We used a 
      broad search strategy to capture descriptions of longitudinal patient engagement 
      that may not have used words such as "partner" or "advisor". RESULTS: A total of 
      506 eligible papers were identified, representing patient partnership activities 
      in mostly high-income countries. These studies overwhelmingly described patient 
      partnership in health research. We identified clusters of literature about 
      patient partnership in cancer and mental health. The literature is saturated with 
      single-site descriptive studies of patient partnership on individual projects or 
      initiatives. There is a lack of work synthesizing impacts, facilitating factors 
      and outcomes of patient partnership in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: There is not yet 
      a consolidated understanding of the role, activities or impacts of patient 
      partners. Advancement of the literature has been stymied by a lack of 
      consistently used terminology. The literature is ready to move beyond single-site 
      descriptions, and synthesis of existing pockets of high-quality theoretical work 
      will be essential to this evolution.

TI  - How contexts and issues influence the use of policy-relevant research syntheses: 
      a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 604-48
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12026 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Evidence briefs have emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing the 
      best available research evidence for health system policymakers and stakeholders. 
      An evidence brief may draw on systematic reviews and many other types of 
      policy-relevant information, including local data and studies, to describe a 
      problem, options for addressing it, and key implementation considerations. We 
      conducted a systematic review to examine the ways in which context- and 
      issue-related factors influence the perceived usefulness of evidence briefs among 
      their intended users. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis approach 
      to review both empirical and nonempirical literature and to develop a model that 
      explains how context and issues influence policymakers' and stakeholders' views 
      of the utility of evidence briefs prepared for priority policy issues. We used a 
      "compass" question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic 
      searches in CINAHL, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, IPSA, MEDLINE, OAIster (gray literature), 
      ProQuest A&I Theses, ProQuest (Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences 
      Index and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International 
      Bibliography of Social Sciences, PAIS, Political Science), PsychInfo, Web of 
      Science, and WilsonWeb (Social Science Abstracts). Finally, we used a grounded 
      and interpretive analytic approach to synthesize the results. FINDINGS: Of the 
      4,461 papers retrieved, 3,908 were excluded and 553 were assessed for 
      "relevance," with 137 included in the initial sample of papers to be analyzed and 
      an additional 23 purposively sampled to fill conceptual gaps. Several themes 
      emerged: (1) many established types of "evidence" are viewed as useful content in 
      an evidence brief, along with several promising formatting features; (2) 
      contextual factors, particularly the institutions, interests, and values of a 
      given context, can influence views of evidence briefs; (3) whether an issue is 
      polarizing and whether it is salient (or not) and familiar (or not) to actors in 
      the policy arena can influence views of evidence briefs prepared for that issue; 
      (4) influential factors can emerge in several ways (as context driven, issue 
      driven, or a result of issue-context resonance); (5) these factors work through 
      two primary pathways, affecting either the users or the producers of briefs; and 
      (6) these factors influence views of evidence briefs through a variety of 
      mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Those persons funding and preparing evidence briefs need 
      to consider a variety of context- and issue-related factors when deciding how to 
      make them most useful in policymaking.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the sociodemographic characteristics, activities, 
      motivations, experiences, skills and challenges of patient partners working 
      across multiple health system settings in Canada. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional 
      survey of self-identified patient partners. SETTING: Patient partners in multiple 
      jurisdictions and health system organisations. PARTICIPANTS: 603 patient partners 
      who had drawn on their experiences with the health system as a patient, family 
      member or informal caregiver to try to improve it in some way, through their 
      involvement in the activities of a group, organisation or government. RESULTS: 
      Survey respondents predominantly identified as female (76.6%), white (84%) and 
      university educated (70.2%) but were a heterogeneous group in the scope 
      (activities and organisations), intensity (number of hours) and longevity (number 
      of years) of their role. Primary motivations for becoming a patient partner were 
      the desire to improve the health system based on either a negative (36.2%) or 
      positive (23.3%) experience. Respondents reported feeling enthusiastic (83.6%), 
      valued (76.9%) and needed (63.3%) always or most of the time; just under half 
      felt they had always or often been adequately compensated in their role. 
      Knowledge of the health system and the organisation they partner with are key 
      skills needed. Two-thirds faced barriers in their role with over half identifying 
      power imbalances. Less than half were able to see how their input was reflected 
      in decisions or changes always or most of the time, and 40.3% had thought about 
      quitting. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first of its kind to examine at a 
      population level, the characteristics, experiences and dynamics of a large sample 
      of self-identified patient partners. Patient partners in this sample are a 
      sociodemographically homogenous group, yet heterogeneous in the scope, intensity 
      and longevity of roles. Our findings provide key insights at a critical time, to 
      inform the future of patient partnership in health systems.
