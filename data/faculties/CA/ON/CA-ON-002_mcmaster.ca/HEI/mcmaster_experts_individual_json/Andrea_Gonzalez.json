  "overview": "Dr. Gonzalez’ research program focuses on the developmental consequences of early life adversity; the impact of traumatic experience on brain development, behavioural outcomes and health; the intergenerational transmission of risk; and developing and evaluating evidence-based preventive interventions. Her previous training encompasses psychology, neuroscience and epidemiology with specific emphasis on assessing preventive interventions, stress physiology, parenting, and statistical modelling including structural equation modelling and hierarchical linear modelling. She holds a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Family Health and Preventive Interventions and has been funded by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, and the Behavioral Brain Foundation.  She is the co-Principal Investigator on several evaluations of parenting programs where she collects both behavioural and biological measures from mothers and their children (ages 0-6 years) within the context of evidence-based interventions.  Together with her colleagues, Strong Families research team and trainees, her overall mission is to generate high quality evidence and programs to build stronger families and communities, thereby creating the best possible foundation for all children.",
