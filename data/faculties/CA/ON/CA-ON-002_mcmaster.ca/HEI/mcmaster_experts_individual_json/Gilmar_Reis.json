  "overview": "Dr. Reis received his MD at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1989 and Cardiology Fellowship/  cardiology board certification at Hospital Vera Cruz, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 1992.  He went to University of Michigan, Ann Arbor MI, USA for a Research fellowship and Masters Degree in 1.993. His research on Rheumatic Diseases was the basis for his Ph.D. at the Heart Institute, University of São Paulo Medical School, São Paulo, Brazil, He has current appointments as Associate Professor of Medicine at Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais since 2.003 and Associate Professor (part time) at Faculty of Sciences, Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact, McMaster University. He is fellow of the American College of Cardiology and European Society of Cardiology since  2.011.Dr. Reis has been involved in several multicentric clinical trials in cardiology and Intensive Care Medicine since his returning to Brazil. During the COVID-19 pandemics Dr Reis designed an adaptive clinical research trial for interventional therapies in early COVID-19 diseased patients. He led a group of Brazilian scientists and built up a solid research capacity. This growing research network are now based in more than 40 cities across the country, with close partnership with public health authorities, Unified Health System - SUS. The stablished partnership with McMaster researchers was pivotal for the success of this trial, named TOGETHER Trial and his invite to be part of the McMaster Community.TOGETHER Trial turned out to be one of the most successful trials in the pandemic, with multiple publications and outstanding contributions, saving thousands of lives, and being nominated for a DAVID SACKETT award as the \"Best Trial of the Year 2021\" by the Society for Clinical Trials. The award was presented at the annual meeting held in San Diego in May 2022.",
