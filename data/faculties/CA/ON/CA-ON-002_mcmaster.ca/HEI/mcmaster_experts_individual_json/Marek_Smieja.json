  "overview": "My primary research interests are in the diagnosis of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, and in the role of chronic infections in respiratory and cardiovascular disease.I am involved in the development and evaluation of respiratory diagnostic tests for SARS-Coronavirus, influenza, and rhinovirus.  Our lab develops tests for respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, in Canada and in Botswana.My HIV studies have examined the interaction with HIV infection and cardiovascular disease, with current studies focusing on smoking cessation, inflammation, and dental health.",
