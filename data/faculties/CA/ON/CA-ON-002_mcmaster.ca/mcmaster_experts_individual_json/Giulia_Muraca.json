  "overview": "Dr. Giulia Muraca received her B.Sc. in Biological Anthropology and African Studies from the University of Toronto and her M.P.H. and Ph.D. degrees from the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia. Dr. Muraca’s doctoral research used population-based data to characterize maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality in deliveries requiring forceps, vacuum, and cesarean delivery. She completed a Postdoctoral Fellowship in the Clinical Epidemiology Unit at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, where she developed epidemiologic approaches to identify optimal intervention rates (e.g., cesarean delivery rate, induction rate) that minimize the frequency of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes (e.g., postpartum hemorrhage, obstetric anal sphincter injury, maternal sepsis, neonatal sepsis, birth injury). Dr. Muraca’s research program at McMaster aims to continue this work and to, more broadly, produce evidence to support enhanced safety and satisfaction in the care of pregnant individuals and their children, with emphasis on care quality, accessibility and equity.",
