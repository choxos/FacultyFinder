  "overview": "Dr. Imran Satia graduated in Medicine from the University of Cambridge in 2006. He gained his Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (London, UK) and completed his specialist training in general internal medicine and respiratory medicine in the North-West Deanery. In 2017 he was awarded a PhD from the University of Manchester in the mechanisms of cough in asthma and was awarded the British Medical Association James Trust Award. Imran was subsequently awarded the European Respiratory Society Respire 3 Marie Curie Post-Doctoral Fellowship. Imran is currently on Faculty at McMaster University, Canada and the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health. He consults on patients with asthma, refractory chronic cough, complex airways diseases and has a broad research interest in understanding the mechanisms and developing treatments for these troublesome conditions.",
