  "overview": "Dr. Jolly is a clinical trialist and interventional cardiologist at McMaster University who has led several important international randomized trials in interventional cardiology (TOTAL, N=10,732 and RIVAL, N=7021). He completed Internal Medicine, Cardiology and Interventional Cardiology training at the University of Toronto. Dr. Jolly completed a MSc in research methodology in 2007 under the guidance of Shamir Mehta and Salim Yusuf at McMaster University. He is currently the global principal investigator for the CLEAR OASIS 9 trial a 2x2 factorial randomized trial of colchicine and spironolactone in acute myocardial infarction.Dr. Jolly also specializes in chronic total occlusion and complex percutaneous coronary intervention.",
