  "overview": "Dr. Sandra Monteiro is a Faculty of Health Sciences MERIT Scientist appointed to the Department of Medicine. She has a second appointment to the Centre for Simulation Based Learning as the Assistant Director of Simulation Scholarship. Dr. Monteiro is internationally recognized for her research program on clinical reasoning and her expertise in measurement principles and competency assessment. In a prior secondment to Touchstone Institute, (2014 - 2021), she served as the Director of Research and Analysis, and supported the development of several competency based assessments for various regulated healthcare professions in Canada. At McMaster University, she teaches and supervises students in various graduate programs, including Rehabilitation Sciences, Health Sciences Education and Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour. In 2021, she was recognized for her contributions to education and mentorship with a Canadian Association of Medical Education Meridith Marks New Educator Award.Sandra has established a successful international collaboration investigating theoretical models of cognitive processes behind clinical reasoning with application for education and assessment. In 2023 she was awarded a KIPRIME fellowship as recognition of her contribution to medical education. Sandra is currently expanding her research focus to translate evidence into strategies that address inequity in healthcare and medical education. Her dedication to equity is clear through her advocacy for fair and equitable evaluations of junior faculty and learners.",
