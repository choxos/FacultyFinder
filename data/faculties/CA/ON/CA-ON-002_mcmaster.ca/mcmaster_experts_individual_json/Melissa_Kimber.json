  "overview": "Dr. Kimber is a Registered Social Worker with the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers. She received her PhD (2015) in Health Research Methodology (Population and Public Health Specialization) from the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact at McMaster University. Informed by clinical and research training and experience, her program of work focuses on mental disorders and violence among children and adolescents. To this end, her research studies utilize qualitative, quantitative and mixed method research designs to: (a) understand and characterize the epidemiology of violence and mental disorders among children and adolescents; (b) support practitioners to safely recognize and respond to children’s mental health concerns and their exposure to violence; and (c) develop, implement and evaluate preventative interventions. Her transdisciplinary training includes social work, population and public health, and health research methodology; with a specialized emphasis on implementation science, and mixed methods research. In the last five years, Dr. Kimber has received funding from provincial and federal funding authorities, including the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and the Public Health Agency of Canada.",
