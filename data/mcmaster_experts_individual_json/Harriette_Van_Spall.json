She then obtained a Master of Public Health degree at the Harvard School of Public Health. She is a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, with certification in Internal Medicine, Cardiology, and Level III Echocardiography. She is appointed in the Department of Medicine and the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact at McMaster University.Clinical activitiesDr. Van Spall is a full-time cardiologist in the Department of Medicine. Her clinical focus is in Heart Failure, Echocardiography, and Acute Care Cardiology. She is actively involved in the clinical education of medical students, residents, and clinical fellows.Research interestsDr. Van Spall is a data scientist and clinical trialist, with expertise in heart failure, health research methods, and implementation science. She is also well known for her work in diversity and inclusion in the research enterprise. She is a primary research supervisor and mentor to several postgraduate fellows, graduate students, and medical residents. Her research is funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, among others. She has garnered more than $6.0 million in research funding, and has won several research awards, including the prestigious CIHR-Institute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health Mid-Career Lectureship Award in Cardiovascular Sciences and the American Heart Association Nanette Wenger Research Award. Her work is published in high-impact medical journals, including JAMA, Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine, Circulation, JACC, and European Heart Journal. She is an invited speaker at major cardiovascular conferences; a media correspondent; a member of the College of Reviewers at CIHR; and an editorial board member, associate editor, or peer reviewer at several leading journals.",
