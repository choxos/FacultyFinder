  "overview": "Catherine Clase completed degrees in pathology and medicine at Christ’s College, Cambridge, UK, and postgraduate training in internal medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland, and in nephrology and research methodology at McMaster University. Her first faculty appointment was at Dalhousie University from 1997-2001. She is a professor of medicine at McMaster University, and an associate member of the department of Health Research Methods, Evidence and Impact. She is interested in the optimization of medical management and of transitions in people with CKD, in diet and potassium in people with CKD.In 2019 she co-chaired the Canadian commentary on KDIGO metabolic bone disease guidelines and co-chaired the KDIGO potassium controversies conference. She cofounded and leads the St Joseph’s Hamilton Healthcare program for transitioning young people with kidney disease from pediatric to adult practice. She is an advocate for the use of masks in healthcare and the community to preserve health, and editor-in-chief of the website maskevidence.org. She is an ACPJC associate editor, Cochrane senior editor, and former EiC of CJKHD. She is a member of several humanitarian organizations. She is grateful to live and work on the traditional territory shared between the Haudenosaunee confederacy and the Anishinabe nations, acknowledged in the Dish with One Spoon wampum.",
