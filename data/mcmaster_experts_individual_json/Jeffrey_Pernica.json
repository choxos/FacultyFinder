  "overview": "Dr. Jeffrey Pernica, MSc MD FRCPC DTMH, is past Head of the Division of Infectious Disease and Associate Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at McMaster University. His clinical interests, aside from infectious disease in general, include tropical medicine (he is a member of the Canadian Committee to Advise on Tropical Medicine and Travel), immunization (he is the co-chair of the Ontario Immunization Advisory Committee), and congenital CMV (he is the regional lead for the Ontario CMV newborn screening program).His research interests relate to the optimization of the diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections, enteric infections, and sepsis, both for children living in resource-rich as well as resource-limited settings. He has long been involved in global child health and global health research, having worked on retrospective cohort studies, prospective cohort studies, and randomized trials in Botswana and other low- and middle-income countries. He was the recipient of a Hamilton Health Sciences Early Career Award and an IDWeek 2020 Investigator Award. He has received research funding as PI from Hamilton Health Sciences, the Physicians’ Services Incorporated Foundation, the Hamilton Academic Health Sciences Organization Innovation Fund, Grand Challenges Canada, and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.",
