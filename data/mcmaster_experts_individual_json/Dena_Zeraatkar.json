  "overview": "I am an Assistant Professor based at McMaster University.My research centers on evidence synthesis and evaluation to guide complex healthcare and public health decisions.People all over the world are conducting research to address important health or public health problems. These studies, however, often produce conflicting findings, are published faster than people can keep read them and make sense of them, and come with strengths and limitations that may not be immediately apparent. I take all of these studies, evaluate their quality, and use them to optimally inform healthcare and public health decisions.",
