  "overview": "Dr. Khan is an Associate Professor of Orthopaedic Surgery at McMaster University with a focus in shoulder surgery and sports medicine. He completed his undergraduate education in the Bachelor of Health Sciences program at McMaster University where he graduated Summa Cum Laude and went on to complete his medical training at Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine . He remained in Hamilton to pursue residency training in Orthopaedic Surgery at McMaster University and completed a Master’s Degree in Health Research Methodology. Following this he completed fellowship training in Orthopaedic Trauma Surgery from McMaster University and a Sports Medicine and Shoulder Surgery fellowship at the University of Michigan.While at the University of Michigan he gained expertise in open and arthroscopic techniques of the shoulder, elbow, hip and knee as well as complex ligament reconstruction and cartilage restoration procedures. He served as an assistant team physician for two Division 1 NCAA football teams (University of Michigan Wolverines and Eastern Michigan Eagles) while gaining experience in the treatment of the elite athlete.Dr. Khan's research interests relate to orthopaedic sports medicine and clinical outcomes with a focus on the shoulder. He has published over one hundred eighty peer-reviewed papers in top ranking journals. He has received national and international media attention for his research, presented at conferences globally and received multiple research awards for his work.",
