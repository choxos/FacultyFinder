  "overview": "Dr. Rahul Chanchlani is an Associate Professor in the Division of Nephrology, Department of Pediatrics at McMaster Children’s Hospital. After finishing his initial medical training from India, he completed a clinical fellowship in pediatric nephrology at the Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, and also pursued a Master's in Clinical Epidemiology and Clinician Investigator Program from the University of Toronto. He is an associate faculty in the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact (HEI), and cross appointed as a Scientist at ICES and at the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), McMaster University.Dr. Chanchlani is one of the 14 participants selected from 12 countries by the International Society of Nephrology for the Emerging Leader’s Program, which helps early-career nephrologists to become qualified for a leadership role in the advancement of global kidney care. In addition to clinical and teaching commitments, Dr. Chanchlani has an established research program that aims to promote interdisciplinary collaborations among peers and experts to address key knowledge gaps in common kidney diseases such as acute kidney injury, kidney transplantation, hypertension and nephrotic syndrome among children.As principal investigator, his research program is supported by grants from various local, provincial and national organizations including CIHR and Kidney Foundation of Canada. He has so far published >80 peer-reviewed papers and has supervised learners at all levels of training. He is also the recipient of the prestigious Renee Habib Young Investigator Award from the International Pediatric Nephrology Association (IPNA).",
