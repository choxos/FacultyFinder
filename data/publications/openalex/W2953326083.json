  "title": "AB1382-HPR COMPARISON OF EFFICACY OF DIFFERENT REHABILITATION APPROACHES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS",
  "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common rheumatologic disease in the world, resulting primarily in progressive cartilage destruction. OA-induced changes are the main cause of disability and are mostly seen in the knee joint. <h3>Objectives</h3> To investigate the effects of different rehabilitation practices on the range of motion, muscle strength, pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee OA. <h3>Methods</h3> Thirty patients between the ages of 40-65 with knee OA were included in the study and divided into 3 groups. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), ultrasound, hotpack/coldpack and home exercise program were given to the 1. group (n=10) for 15 days. 2. group (n=10) received three doses of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) followed by home exercise program for 15 days. The control group (n=10) received only home exercise program for 15 days. All individuals were evaluated using 'Goniometer' for Range of Motion (ROM), 'Manual Muscle Test' for M. Quadriceps femoris muscle strength, 'Visual Analogue Scale' for pain, 'The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis (WOMAC) Scale' for physical function and 'Short Form-12 Quality of Life Scale Mental (SF-12 - MC) and Physical Component (SF-12 - PC)' for quality of life at baseline and end of treatment. <h3>Results</h3> Statistically significant difference was found at pain and WOMAC score at the time of activity in all groups (Table 1). Statistically significant difference was found at ROM and SF-12 MC score in group 1 and 2; at resting pain and SF-12 PC score in control group (p &lt;0.05) (Table 2). <h3>Conclusion</h3> In addition to electrotherapy treatment and PRP in knee OA treatment, it is thought that home exercise program can be used to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life in knee OA. <h3>References</h3> [1] Huang GL, Hua S, Yang TM, et al.
