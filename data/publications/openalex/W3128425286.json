The news of pronouncement of prophethood by Muhammad s.a.w. was listened by the people of subcontinent through the Arab and Indian traders. The arrival of regular troops of Muslims was started in subcontinent in the era of Omar Farooq (R.A). The history communicates that the commanders of these initial groups of Muslim militants were three brothers belonged to the valley of Taaif, Usman bin Abu Al’asi (R.A), Hakm bin Abu Ala’asi (R.A) and Mugerah bin Abu Ala’asi (R.A). Later, Muslim forces again appeared in the subcontinent for spreading and promoting Islamic teachings and this was also organized by a person of Taaif, Hajjaj bin Yusuf Thaqafi. This army was headed by young worrier of Taaif Muhammad bin Qasim Thaqafi. People of Taaif contributed a lot to establish Islam in subcontinent. This research is focusing on those people who belong to Taaif city and served in subcontinent for Islam and they played pivotal role in this regard.
