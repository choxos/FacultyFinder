  "title": "The Masson Trichrome Staining Methods in Routine Laboratory Use",
  "abstract": "A resume of Masson's trichrome staining methods is given, with detailed directions for carrying out all of his procedures. The results obtained thru their use in a routine laboratory are discussed at length, as well as the fact that they also work very well on tissues fixed in ways other than those he prescribes, and stained with chemicals and dyes other than those he uses. The fact is stressed, however, that the closer one adheres to his precepts, the better will be the results.The stains described include bis hematozylin-phloxine-saffron, his iron-hematozylin-ponceau-anilin-blue, his variants of this stain (of which the light green stain is excellent), his metanil yellow and his modification of the familiar Van Gieson technic. All these stains are based on familiar laboratory methods, improved and rendered trichrome, so that they present no great obstacles in technic.Of the methods cited, the writer prefers the \"light green\" procedure. Sections are prestained in Regaud's iron-hematoxylin, followed by a mixture of ponceau de xylidine and acid fuchsin. This is followed by mordanting in phosphomolybdic acid and the sections are finally stained in light green. The results are very precise and pleasing and afford immediate orientation as the connective tissue is green, the nuclei black or dark purple, the cytoplasm of the cells is in varying tones of red. The method may be used after fixation in almost any good medium; altho the results are not as brilliant as those obtained after one of Masson's prescribed fixations, it is believed that they are even then superior to those following the routine hematoxylin-eosin method.",
