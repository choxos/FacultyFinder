Evidence-Based Mental Health is one of a number of resources being developed to help clinicians who want to use the strategies of evidence-based practice (EBP).1 EBP harnesses recent advances in clinical epidemiology, biostatistics, and information science to produce a coherent and comprehensive approach to allow clinicians to base their practice on the best available evidence.\n\nEBP, far from being an esoteric activity pursued by ivory tower academics with too much time on their hands, meets a real clinical need. Evidence suggests that clinicians tend to underestimate their information requirements and, when they do recognise a need for information, they do not access the most reliable and least biased sources.2 This leads to a gap between research and clinical practice which manifests as unwarranted variations in clinical practice. There are only 2 explanations for these variations: either there is no evidence on which to base practice, or that there is evidence, but at least some of us are not using it.3 The inevitable result of these variations is that some patients are not receiving the best available care.\n\nThere are several examples of the existence of such variations. One of the clearest findings in the field of mental health is the under recognition and diversity in the treatment of depression in various healthcare settings. It has proved difficult to narrow this gap between research and practice despite the production of increasingly emphatic consensus statements.4, 5 Within specialist psychiatric practice, there are the unexplained variations in the rates of use of electroconvulsive treatment both in the United States and the United Kingdom.6, 7 There are …",
