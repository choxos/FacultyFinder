  "title": "The Hudson County Court House and Hugh Roberts: A Building and Architect in Perspective",
  "abstract": "Hugh Roberts, the architect of the Hudson County Court House, has had his career identified in totality with this building that brought him fame for its artistic stature and shame for his envelopment in the graft scandal that followed its 1910 opening. History has been kinder to him than were his contemporaries. Accusations against him are now considered to have been unjustified, but the imbroglio derailed his practice. The court house and much of the Roberts oeuvre originated through the influence of and his relationships with the politically powerful. Examination of the court house project, Robertsâ€™ other work and the law suit place both architect and building in sharper focus.",
