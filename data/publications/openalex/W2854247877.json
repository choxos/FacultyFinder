  "title": "Veils and Lap Cloths: The Great Cover Up of Bynum and the Bible in Black Churches",
  "abstract": "Dr. Juanita Bynum serves as a proxy for modern-day patriarchal men who police women’s bodies in much the same way men policed women’s bodies in the biblical world. In sum, Bynum and biblical writers advance the patriarchal agenda of controlling the female body by employing barriers in the form of veils and lap cloths. In this article, I challenge the “cover up” projects of Bynum and the Black Church(es) by examining the use of veils in the Old Testament. After considering the five Hebrew words most often translated as “veil” in the Old Testament, I employ the exegetical tools of sociohistorical and rhetorical criticism to read these biblical stories of veiling, which undoubtedly undergird the practices of covering up (physically and metaphorically) in Black Church traditions. I also connect Bynum’s project to a history of stereotyping Black women and respectability politics.",
