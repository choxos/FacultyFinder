We examined the utilization of PSA within a large multi-specialty hospital system before and after the recommendation. METHODS MultiCare (MHS) is a large multi-specialty health care system with nearly 600 providers and 5 employed urologists. We counted and reviewed all new PSA consultations, prostate biopsy procedures (new, not as part of an active surveillance protocol), and PSA tests ordered by the entire system between April 1, 2011 and October 31, 2012 in an effort to document the impact of the USPSTF PSA rating. RESULTS A total of 240 referrals for elevated PSA were seen and 164 prostate biopsies were performed during the study period. In the 6 months following the USPSTF recommendations, a 17% decrease in referrals for elevated PSA and a 16% decrease in the numbers of biopsies performed was documented. At 12 months following the recommendations, a 28% decrease in elevated PSA referrals and a 64% decrease in number of biopsies performed was measured. There was a more modest decline of 5% in the number of PSA tests performed overall at our institution. CONCLUSIONS The USPSTF ‘D' rating of PSA made a substantial impact on PSA utilization, both as a screening tool and an indicator for prostate biopsy, within the our integrated health care system. Additional study on a broader scale is necessary to confirm these findings. © 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 189Issue 4SApril 2013Page: e513 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Richard Greene Tacoma, WA More articles by this author Timothy Tausch Tacoma, WA More articles by this author Deo Perez Tacoma, WA More articles by this author Mark Shellmyer Tacoma, WA More articles by this author Douglas Sutherland Tacoma, WA More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
