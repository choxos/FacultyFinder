  "abstract": "exhibition in its new quarters on the seventh floor of the W.A.C. Bennett Library.The works on display were on loan from a larger collection owned by an anonymous collector from Vancouver who was dubbed 'The Renaissance Collector.'The modest catalogue of this exhibition provides some biographical information on Aldus and comments on the editions of the Aldine Press in terms of format, type, scholarship, and status.There is also a brief checklist at the end.Only twenty-five items were apparently on display; approximately half were actual imprints of the press, the earliest being Valerius Maximus's Dictorum et factorum memorabilium libri novem (I502), and the remaining items exhibited were secondary literature.Unfortunately, the catalogue has no illustrations, although internet users can obtain a visual understanding of the richness of the exhibition at Simon Fraser's Web site (http://www.1ib.sfu.ca/proj/aldus.htm).Rare book libraries sometimes mount exhibitions on loan from collectors in the hope that the collector in question will then decide to make a donation of the material.In this particular case, the collector, Hugh McDonald, in fact decided to donate his collection with the financial assistance of the Vancouver businessman, Morris J. Woak.McDonald's donation of I30 editions was appraised at $5oo,ooo in March 1996.Ralph Stanton and his colleagues at Simon Fraser University are to be congratulated for preparing the groundwork to this important donation and for making it accessible to researchers.",
