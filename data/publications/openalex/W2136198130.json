We describe the incidence, management and outcomes of surgically treated kidney stones after SCI. We also evaluated the impact of the injury level and past history of kidney stones on the occurrence of kidney stones. METHODS We conducted a retrospective cohort study using linked, population-based healthcare data from Ontario, Canada. 5121 patients were followed a median of 4 years after an incident SCI (occurring between 2002-2011). The primary outcome was surgical intervention for upper tract kidney stones. RESULTS In follow-up, 66 patients (1.3%) had 89 episodes of surgically treated kidney stones. Treatments included: ureteroscopy (34%), ureteral stent/percutaneous nephrostomy (30%), shockwave lithotripsy (19%), or percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (17%). Following stone treatment, the 30-day mortality rate was low, and the 30-day admission rate to an intensive care unit was 12%. The risk of surgically treated kidney stones was no different between patients with cervical versus thoracolumbar SCI (3.4 vs. 3.9 per 1000 person-years, HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.49-1.61). A history of surgically treated kidney stones prior to SCI (compared to no such history) was associated with a higher risk of kidney stones after SCI (27 vs. 3 per 1000 person-years; adjusted HR 14.74, 95% CI 5.69-38.22). CONCLUSIONS During intermediate followup after SCI, surgically treated upper tract kidney stones occur in 1.3% of patients. Ureteroscopy is the most common treatment. A history of surgically managed kidney stones prior to SCI portends a higher risk of stones after SCI. © 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 189Issue 4SApril 2013Page: e696-e697 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Blayne Welk London, Canada More articles by this author Salimah Shariff London, Canada More articles by this author Michael Ordon Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Catherine Craven Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Sender Herschorn Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Amit Garg London, Canada More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
