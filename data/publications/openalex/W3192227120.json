We evaluated the definition of clinically significant hydroureter, its association with UTI and whether continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) impacted UTI risk. METHODS: Patients with prenatal hydronephrosis from seven centers were enrolled into the Society for Fetal Urology Hydronephrosis Registry from 2008-2020. Patients with ureteral measurement on ultrasound were included. Patients with ureterocele, ectopic ureter, neurogenic bladder, posterior urethral valves, horseshoe or solitary kidney, known ureteropelvic junction obstruction, or follow-up <1 month were excluded. Primary outcome was UTI. Analyses were performed using Cox regression. RESULTS: Of 1406 enrollees, 237 met inclusion criteria. Hydroureter of 7 mm was a significant threshold to differentiate patients at higher UTI risk. Patients with ureters ≥7 mm had almost three times the risk of UTI adjusting for sex, circumcision, CAP, and hydronephrosis grade (HR=2.7, 95% CI:1.1-6.5, p=0.03). In patients without vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), ureteral dilation ≥7 mm corresponded with higher UTI risk compared to ureteral diameter <7 mm on multivariable analysis (HR=4.6, 95% CI: 1.1-19.5, p=0.04; Figure 1). Conversely, in patients with VUR, ureteral diameter ≥7 mm did not impact UTI risk (HR=1.1, 95% CI:0.31-3.6, p =0.93). CAP was significantly protective against UTI for patients with hydroureter (HR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.28-0.87, p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first prospectively collected, multicenter study to show that prenatal hydronephrosis with hydroureter ≥7 mm identifies a high UTI risk group who would benefit from antibiotic prophylaxis. In contrast, patients with prenatal hydronephrosis and non-refluxing hydroureter <7 mm may be managed more conservatively.
