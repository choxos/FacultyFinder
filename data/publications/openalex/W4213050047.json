  "title": "Typical Girls: The Rhetoric of Womanhood in Comic Strips",
  "abstract": "As a bookworm girl, I relished the friends I found in the pages of the comics.I felt a profound kinship with Charlie Brown and his longing to kick the football, although I must admit that, strangely enough, I identified most strongly with the quiet loyalty of Woodstock.I also adored Opus the Penguin and shared his love of odd infotainment devices.Later, I connected with the tragic melodrama of Rogue of the X-Men, imagining myself a similarly lonely spirit who was cursed to suck the energy from others.Over time I formed attachments to Grendel, Concrete, Tankgirl, and Dream, to name only a few.These fictional friends sustained and encouraged me, and, in ways I never could have imagined, led me to new friends and mentors, many of whom inspired this book.It turns out that the creators behind the comics are just as amazing as their characters, and I'm grateful to",
