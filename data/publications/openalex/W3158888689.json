  "title": "Health Risk Assessment of Abamectin and Buprofezin Residues in Eggplant and Pepper Plants",
  "abstract": "Eggplant and pepper plants were sprayed with abamectin and buprofezin, respectively once at the recommended rate to study the residues and effect of tap water and acetic acid (1%) treatment as washing solution on their residues. Their risk assessment was also studied and summarized results show the following: The initial amounts of each pesticide in leaves of eggplant and pepper were much higher than the fruits. Loss percentages in residue amounts were higher in eggplant and pepper fruits than leaves. The washing of treated fruits (eggplant and pepper) with tap water and acetic acid 1% reduced considerable amounts of abamectin and buprofezin residues and it was noticed that the effect of acetic acid 1% was better than tap water in removing pesticide residues. Abamectin half-life values were 2.23 and 3.58 days on eggplant fruits and eggplant leaves, respectively. Data also revealed that fruits were consumed safely after 9 days of treatment, according to the MRL (EU Pesticides database - European Commission was 0.09 mg/kg) and risk quotient (RQ). Washing with tap water and acetic acid (1%) doesn't change this period. The calculated half-life values of buprofezin were 1.94 and 2.55 days in pepper fruits and leaves, respectively. This indicated that only 1 day was long enough to reduce the residues below the maximum residue limits (2mg/kg) on pepper according to the EU Pesticides database â€“ European Commission and RQ. While washing with tap water and acetic acid (1%) reduced this period to two hours.",
