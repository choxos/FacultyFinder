Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a risk factor for CVD. The objectives of this study were to describe the CVD characteristics and risk factors in PC patients and the relationship between CVD risk and how ADT is used in real-world practice. METHODS: RADICAL-PC (Role of Androgen Deprivation Therapy in CArdiovascular Disease – A Longitudinal Prostate Cancer Study) is an ongoing prospective cohort study. We recruited 2395 consecutive men (mean age 68 years) with newly diagnosed PC or with a plan to prescribe ADT for the first time. Cardiovascular risk was estimated by calculating Framingham risk scores. A Framingham score >17 (corresponding with a predicted 10-year CVD risk of >30%) was considered high-risk. Multivariable logistic regression was performed with ADT use as the outcome variable and CVD risk factors as the exposures of interest. RESULTS: The prevalence of known CVD for the entire cohort was 22% and 35% had a Framingham risk score >17. Most participants (58%) were current or former smokers; 16% had diabetes; 45% had hypertension and 23% had high blood pressure but had not received a diagnosis of hypertension; 31% were obese (BMI ≥30kg/m2); 24% had low levels of physical activity. There was a positive relationship between each major cardiovascular risk factor and the use of ADT. However, after adjustment for age, education, alcohol use, BMI and time from PC diagnosis to eligibility assessment, these associations were significantly attenuated. Participants in whom ADT was planned had higher Framingham risk scores than those not intending to receive ADT. This risk was abolished after adjustment for confounders. CONCLUSIONS: One in three men with PC is at high cardiovascular risk. Men receiving ADT are a priori at higher CVD risk than PC patients whose treatment strategy does not include ADT. These differences are explained by confounding factors.
