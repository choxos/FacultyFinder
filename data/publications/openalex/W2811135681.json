  "title": "Viral Diseases of Crops in Nepal",
  "abstract": "Viral diseases are the important diseases next to the fungal and bacterial in Nepal. The increase in incidence and severity of viral diseases and emergence of new viral diseases causes the significant yield losses of different crops in Nepal. But the research and studies on plant viral diseases are limited. Most of the studies were focused in viral diseases of rice (Rice tungro virus and Rice dwarf virus), tomato (Yellow leaf curl virus) and potato (PVX and PVY). Maize leaf fleck virus and mosaic caused by Maize mosaic virus were recorded as minor disease of maize. Citrus Tristeza Virus is an important virus of citrus fruit in Nepal while Papaya ringspot potyvirus, Ageratum yellow vein virus (AYVV), Tomato leaf curlJava betasatellite and Sida yellow vein Chinaalphasatellite were recorded from the papaya fruit. The Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) and Zucchini yellow mosaic potyvirus (ZYMV) are the viral diseases of cucurbitaceous crop reported in Nepal. Mungbean yellow mosaic India virus (MYMIV) found to infect the many crops Limabean, Kidney bean, blackgram and Mungbean. Bean common mosaic necrosis virus in sweet bean, Pea leaf distortion virus (PLDV), Cowpea aphid‚Äêborne mosaic potyvirus (CABMV), Peanut bud necrosis virus (PBNV) in groundnut, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Chili veinal mottle potyvirus (CVMV) and Tomatoyellow leaf curl gemini virus (TYLCV) were only reported and no any further works have been carried out. The 3 virus diseases Soyabean mosaic (SMV), Soybean yellow mosaic virus and Bud blight tobacco ring spot virus (TRSV) were found in soybean.Int. J. Appl. Sci. Biotechnol. Vol 6(2): 75-80",
