  "title": "Air purification in highly-urbanized areas with the use of TiO<sub>2.</sub> New approach in designing urban public space with beneficial human condition",
  "abstract": "Abstract This paper deals with the possibilities of architectural design benefiting human conditions, which encompasses physical well-being, environmental quality of life in highly-urbanized areas. Nowadays, the urban pollution is rising on a global scale. The paper is focused on a new possibility to resolve the problem of air purification in big cities by advanced architectural design of public use spaces in the urban environment. The first part of the paper depicts possible usage of Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) technology - nanoparticles of TiO 2 , as a building materials component. These components are the latest findings in the field of nanomaterials development, and their effectiveness due to the usage of the photocatalysis, which depends on eliminating various atmospheric pollutants and especially clears the atmosphere from nitrogen oxides. These components, together with calcium carbonate which neutralizes any acidic gasses that may be absorbed, are beneficial. Photoactive construction materials are mainly activated under UV light irradiation. The second part presents the results of the research program Climate Change Adapted Architecture and Building Structures, which has been conducted by Krystyna Januszkiewicz (the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture for a few years at West Pomeranian University of Technology (WPUT) in Szczecin). The presented designs were developed with co-operation of Magdalena Janus and Kamila Bogacz (Institute of Chemical and Environmental Engineering) as applications samples of titanium dioxide technology (photocatalytic active building materials) in the urban space. In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the usage of titanium technology, as a construction materials component such as concrete and gypsum, or as a component of active membrane fabrics, opening a new way in architecture and structure designing in the urban public space. This is all indispensable to improve citizensâ€™ health and to clear the atmosphere from nitrogen oxides or the volatile organic compounds. Moreover, it also serves as the basis for newly-built communities.",
