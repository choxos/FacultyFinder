  "title": "Picture Naming and Lexical Access in Italian Children and Adults",
  "abstract": "Abstract Italian-speaking adults and 5- to 6-year-old children were compared in a timed picture-naming task, measuring latency as well as name agreement, in relation to frequency, age of acquisition (AoA), picture complexity, word length, word complexity, semantic category, phonological characteristics, and grammatical gender. Although children were slower and less accurate than adults, correlations of dependent variables with lexical predictors were similar in both groups. However, word complexity had effects on adults that were not seen in children, and grammatical gender had effects on children that were not seen in adults. Adult ratings of AoA had strong effects on both groups, but an objective measure of AoA only affected children. Adult and child reaction times were also differentially affected by semantic category (especially animal names). Results have implications for developmental and cross-linguistic studies of lexical access, in and out of context.",
