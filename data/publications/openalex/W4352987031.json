  "title": "The Intimate Ironies of the Wifey: Material Religion and the Body",
  "abstract": "In August 2020, Zoom was still something of a strange place.Like the gender performances we summoned as we spoke-the wife and the wifey, the artist and the influencer-Zoom evokes intimacy as well as expanse.Our contributions took us from the familiarity of scent to the spread of colonial space/time, pulling us into Black vernacular culture and \"linking\" us to divine power through the digital.As we saw our heads appearing side by side, Toronto (Suzanne van Geuns), New Haven (Dustin Gavin), and Hamilton (Ellen Amster) suddenly close enough to touch, we were struck by the ironies that stack up in the gender performances we discussed.Continually drawing in and refusing their audiences, they never quite stay fixed in the frame. Key wordsGender performances as openings or windows-into colonial space/time, into Black vernacular culture, into divine power Intimacy-of the body, its smells and familiarities, of affiliation and connection as gendered performances Space-as calling on religious histories, gendered embodiment as enmeshment with space, as existing online in dynamics of perusing/browsing, as circulation in or out of control Irony-gender performance and irony as they become possible by taking on the perspective of the watching audience, humor as happening through being a gender and not being it, performances that are always removed from their audience, performances that are always already refusing any other perspective",
