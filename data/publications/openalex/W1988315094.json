  "title": "The afferent connections of the inferior olivary complex in rats: A study using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase",
  "abstract": "Abstract Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was used to define the origin of afferents to the inferior olivary complex (IOC) in rats. Using both ventral and dorsal surgical approaches to the brainstem, HRP was injected into the IOC through a micropipette affixed to the tip of a 1‐μl Hamilton syringe. After a 2‐day postoperative survival, animals were sacrificed by transcardiac perfusion with a 1% paraformaldehyde‐1.25% gluteraldehyde solution, and brains were processed according to the DeOlmos protocol (1977), using o‐dianisidine as the chromogen. Labeled cells were found at many levels of the nervous system extending from lumbar spinal cord to cerebral cortex. This wide‐ranging input from numerous regions clearly underscores the complexity of the IOC and its apparent involvement in several functions. Within the spinal cord, labeled neurons were identified from cervical to lumbar but not at sacral levels. These neurons were found contralaterally in the neck region of the dorsal horn and in the medial portions of the intermediate gray. In the caudal brainstem, reactive cells in the dorsal column nuclei, the spinal trigeminal nucleus, and the subnucleus y of the vestibular complex were observed primarily contralateral to the injection sites. Labeling within the gigantocellular, magnocellular, ventral, and lateral reticular nuclei and the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi was primarily ipsilateral. Reactive neurons in the medial and inferior vestibular nuclei were predominantly ipsilateral or contralateral to HRP injections into the caudal or rostral IOC, respectively. The dentate and interposed nuclei of the cerebellum contained small, lightly labeled neurons primarily contralateral to the injection site, while the fastigial nuclei contained a few relatively large, heavily labeled cells bilateral to caudal olivary injections. Ipsilaterally labeled mesencephalic regions included the periaqueductal gray, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, rostromedial red nucleus, ventral tegmental area, medial terminal nucleus of the accessory optic tract, nucleus of the optic tract, and the lateral deep mesencephalic nucleus. The caudal part of the pretectum and small cells of the stratum profundum of the superior colliculus were labeled predominantly contralateral to the injection. In the caudal diencephalon labeled neurons were most numerous within the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and the subparafascicular nucleus, primarily ipsilateral to olivary injections. Scattered reactive neurons were also found within the ipsilateral zone incerta. With the exception of the zona incerta, all labeled mesencephalic and diencephalic nuclei had some bilateral representation of labeled cells. No labeled neurons were identified within the basal ganglia, while numerous reactive cells were found bilaterally within layer V of the frontal and parietal cerebral cortex.",
