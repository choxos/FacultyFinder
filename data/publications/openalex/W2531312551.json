  "title": "Lake and Reservoir Management Made a Splash at the 2016 ASLO Summer Meeting",
  "abstract": "Human demand for water-related ecosystem services has resulted in extensive management of aquatic ecosystems. One of the most obvious forms of this management is the creation of water reservoirs. Two sessions at the 2016 ASLO Summer Meeting were devoted to understanding how management strategies influence aquatic ecosystems, particularly reservoirs: “Water regulation and reservoir management in a context of global change” and “Disentangling the effects of climate change and management in aquatic ecosystems.” The sessions featured 26 oral and poster presentations. The majority of speakers and co-authors came from academia (90 out of 105), with government agencies and industry less heavily represented (12 and 3 respectively out of 105 speakers and co-authors). Sessions examined the linkages between aquatic ecology, limnology, and management at single-system, regional, and national scales. Several themes emerged across these sessions, including: (1) how management strategies interact with climate change signals, (2) tradeoffs and the importance of considering unintended effects of management efforts, and (3) implications of management within waterbodies, within watersheds, or at the scale of the whole land-water ecosystem. The first theme that emerged from these sessions is how management and climate change may interact. One anticipated outcome of climate change is an increase in the severity and frequency of storm events. Megan Fork (Duke University) and colleagues studied the impact of storm events on a reservoir in Tennessee as a way to understand the potential consequences of increased storm frequency and/or severity. They found that stormwater intrusion was influenced by watershed urban development of the receiving reservoir coves, suggesting watershed management may be used to attenuate local climate change signals. However, a mismatch between current management strategies and predicted climate change impacts could actually exacerbate problems. Peter Isles (University of Vermont) and colleagues modeled climate change with a hydrodynamic water-quality sediment diagenesis model of Lake Champlain and found that current lake management strategies emphasizing phosphorus reductions may be counteracted by predicted shifts in nutrient loads driven by climate change scenarios. Finally, Tanner Williamson (Miami University) and colleagues' work on biogeochemical responses to storm events reminded us of the complexities of measuring impacts of climate events in lakes as there can be pronounced temporal and spatial variability. While management efforts often aim to improve local water quality (via fish production, water clarity, dissolved oxygen, or other metrics) or water quantity (i.e., flood control, irrigation supply), several talks in the session explored the unintended tradeoffs associated with such targeted management regimes. These tradeoffs ranged from species-specific mortality to shifts in whole ecosystem carbon balances. Cayelan Carey (Virginia Tech) and colleagues examined the consequences of hypolimnetic oxygenation—a management technique used to prevent the release of metals and nutrients from sediments into overlying waters—in a temperate drinking water reservoir. The technique indeed improved water quality (e.g. decreases in Fe and Mn concentrations), but doubled the global warming potential of greenhouse gas emissions from the water surface via increased respiration rates. Additionally, in northeastern Canadian reservoirs, Gabrielle Trottier (Polytechnique Montréal, McGill University) and colleagues found that large amplitude winter water level drawdowns can limit spring flooding, but at the cost of macroinvertebrate abundance. Examples of management tradeoffs in these sessions were largely restricted to within-system management techniques. Management strategies can target many different scales; speakers highlighted important considerations of management both within lakes or reservoirs and at the watershed scale. Waterbody management often requires a detailed understanding of the system to be controlled; unfortunately, this understanding is often not available or possible to achieve prior to when management decisions must be made. In lakes and reservoirs, this often means managers apply limnological models from lake studies to the less well-studied reservoirs to inform management decisions. Several of the speakers from these sessions outlined why this may not be appropriate. Using an analysis of waterbodies from the United States, Kristin Strock (Dickinson College) and colleagues discussed several examples of how reservoirs differed fundamentally from lakes (e.g., larger catchment areas, higher light attenuation). Alan Groeger (Texas State University) and colleague also pointed out that unlike lakes, some reservoirs experience a hypolimnion that is in motion. Irrespective of the differences between lakes and reservoirs, speakers further emphasized the importance of better incorporating watershed management into lake or reservoir management strategies. By modeling recent water quality conditions within Wisconsin lakes, Kevin Rose (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) and colleagues found that a watershed characteristic, agricultural buffer strips, was an important predictor of lake water quality. Moving into future scenario modeling, Steve Carpenter (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and colleagues showed how different social or technological policies strongly control water quality in urban lakes and how landscape positioning can determine the extent to which watershed management influences reservoir water quality. By the end of these sessions, it became clear that a better understanding of both waterbody and watershed characteristics is needed to inform management decisions. A lively discussion by participants and speakers at the conclusion of these sessions highlighted the importance of considering management through the lens of ongoing climate change. With an ever increasing number of observations documenting aquatic ecosystem response to climate change, Steve Carpenter (University of Wisconsin-Madison) summarized it best when he said “if we can't adapt, we must transform.” Given the range of possible strategies to influence lake or reservoir characteristics, management techniques may present unique opportunities for climate change adaptation and associated buffering of climate change effects. However, as presented in the talks, it is clear that we may need to change the temporal and spatial scales at which we manage lakes and reservoirs. Furthermore, Carpenter noted that while the whole watershed scale is the relevant scale to deal with nonpoint source pollution, we are short on examples of successful nonpoint management strategies. The research presented at ASLO in Santa Fe highlights the complex relationship between ecosystem management and large-scale drivers, such as climate change. While the talks in these sessions highlighted the academic perspective, it will be critical for academics to work closely with practitioners (i.e., industry and governmental) to place research pertaining to aquatic management and policy in the larger context of what is feasible, probable, and/or desirable for the communities within the watershed and in the face of climate change. Hopefully, we will hear much more about this pressing issue at future meetings as we strive to better understand lakes and reservoirs and the trade-offs associated with our management decisions.
