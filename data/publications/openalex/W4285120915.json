  "title": "Consumer Attitude Towards Digital Health Technology Moderated by Fear of COVID-19",
  "abstract": "Introduction: With the rise in COVID-19 cases, hospitals and other patient-centered healthcare institutes realized the importance of having as few patients as possible on premises. This led to an ever-increasing introduction and awareness of digital health products in the market. To ensure consumers are satisfied with the available digital health products, it is critical to understand their attitude towards the tools.Methods: A quantitative study was conducted using SPSS 25 as the tool for analysis. The study was cross-sectional in nature. The study was conducted between December 2020 to February 2021. Questionnaires were made on google forms and were distributed to the participants through social media platforms. 207 participants were approached for filling out the questionnaires through convenient sampling method.Results: All 207 participants filled the questionnaire. The univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses indicated that the results were not conclusive with the hypothesis as we didn’t achieve significant result during regression analysis. The moderator also didn’t have a significant relationship with consumer attitude towards digital health technology.Conclusion: Consumer attitude towards digital health technology was not positive due to participants comfort in meeting their doctors in clinical settings. Even with COVID-19 cases at its peak, participates felt much more comfortable with walk-in in-person sessions.Funding Information: Author Afifa Muhammad Afzal has no financial disclosures.
