  "abstract": "<JATS1:p>'Like Crécy itself, this book is a triumph and the tale it tells gives an old story new life.’-Bernard Cornwell, bestselling author of The Last Kingdom series</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>A groundbreaking new study of the battle of Crécy, in which the outnumbered English under King Edward III won a decisive victory over the French and changed the course of the Hundred Years War.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>The battle of Crécy in 1346 is one of the most famous and widely studied military engagements in history. The repercussions of this battle were felt for hundreds of years, and the exploits of those fighting reached the status of legend. Yet cutting-edge research has shown that nearly everything that has been written about this dramatic event may be wrong.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>In this new study, Michael Livingston reveals how modern scholars have used archived manuscripts, satellite technologies and traditional fieldwork to help unlock what was arguably the battle’s greatest secret: the location of the now quiet fields where so many thousands died.</JATS1:p> <JATS1:p>Crécy: Battle of Five Kingsis a story of past and present. It is a new history of one of the most important battles of the Middle Ages: a compelling narrative account of the battle of Crécy that still adheres to the highest scholarly standards in its detail. It is also an account that incorporates the most cutting-edge revelations and the personal story of how those discoveries were made.</JATS1:p>",
