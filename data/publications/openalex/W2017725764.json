  "title": "Private Support, Public Alienation: Whistle-Blowers and the Paradox of Social Support",
  "abstract": "Blowing the whistle on organizational wrongdoing is a stressful process, complicated by the prevalence of interpersonal and organizational retaliation, including the possibility of slander, physical intimidation, and death threats. This study provides insight on how whistle-blowers experience and characterize social support throughout the whistle-blowing process. Qualitative analysis of 13 in-depth interviews with whistle-blowers in the collegiate sports industry revealed whistle-blowers experienced reduced social support as a result of blowing the whistle. Problematic conditions related to whistle-blowers' experience of social support included the duality of private support but public alienation, diminished size of social support networks, and apathy from the affected organizations. Although whistle-blowers received some support from friends and colleagues in private settings, those same individuals avoided the whistle-blower in public contexts. Themes of private support/public alienation, diminished support network, and institutional apathy emerged from the data. Whistle-blowers responded through cathartic engagement with the media and seeking community amongst fellow whistle-blowers in an effort to augment public social support. Organizational members stigmatized whistle-blowers for speaking out against the organization, reducing whistle-blowers' experience of social support. Contextual factors negatively affected whistle-blowers' experience of social support, including the heightened role of sports on campus and the presence of external stakeholders in the form of fans and alumni. Results indicate that social support is an integral component of the whistle-blowing process. The authors discuss theoretical and practical implications, including the influences of stigma, taint, and social alienation that \"mark\" whistle-blowers.",
