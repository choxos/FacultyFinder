  "abstract": "To demonstrate that transplant tolerance is donor specific and to illustrate the mechanisms whereby this might occur.METHODS: All limb transplants were from C57BL/6 to BALB/c mice and all received 14 days of monoclonalAB, LF, and rapamycin.Group 1 (n=11) received drugs alone.In Group 2 (n=3), graft bone marrow (BM) was eradicated prior to transplantation using 750 cGy γ-irradiation.Recipients were sacrificed if demonstrating signs of rejection or >day 100 post-transplantation when they were deemed to be tolerant.Donor specific tolerance was assessed by skin grafting with grafts from C57BL/6 and third-party (C3H) mice.Flow cytometry was used to detect donor cell chimerism in limb recipients, repopulation of recipient cells in the graft BM, and serum anti-donor antibodies in recipients.RESULTS: Mean survival time in Group 1 was >100 days.In the radiated group, mean survival was 17 days (p<0.05vs group 1) suggesting that donor bone marrow cells are important for inducing recipient immune hyporesponsiveness.Long-term allograft survivors demonstrated a time-dependent increase in donor cell chimerism as well as low anti-donor antibodies in the serum and in the graft, suggesting that B lymphocyte activity was downregulated.Significant levels of recipient B, T and myeloid cells were found to have re-populated graft BM.In long-term survivors, skin grafts from donor strain mice were accepted whereas grafts from a third strain were rejected demonstrating that tolerance is donor specific.CONCLUSIONS: In this model, induction of tolerance appears to be dependent upon intact donor bone marrow cells.Tolerance is associated with re-population of the grafted bone marrow with recipient cells and low levels of anti-donor antibodies.This may suggest that tolerance is achieved by down-regulating B lymphocyte activity in recipients.LEARNING OBJECTIVES: Participants will learn that transplant survival without long-term immunosuppression is possible and the possible mechanisms by which it occurs.",
