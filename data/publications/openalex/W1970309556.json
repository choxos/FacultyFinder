  "title": "A Preliminary Appraisal of the Personnel of the New CCP Central Committee",
  "abstract": "The so-called Ninth National Congress of the CCP was in fact the First National Congress of the Mao Tse-tung faction; its main task was to legitimatize Mao Tse-tung's personal dictatorship and personal deification, and to produce a new organ of Party leadership. We know that prior to the Ninth Congress, among the 170 regular and alternate members of the Central Committee of the Eighth Congress, 115, or nearly 67 percent of the total membership, had already been classified by the Mao Tse-tung clique as \"traitors,\" or \"capitalist-roaders,\" struggled against, purged, and dismissed from office. (1) Among the 27 members of the Central Committee Politburo, ten were labeled \"capitalist-roaders\" and as \"taking a peripheral stand\"; only a few people, like Mao Tse-tung, Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Ch'en Po-ta, K'ang Sheng, Li Hsien-nien, and Hsieh Fu-chih, continued to function. As to the Central Committee Secretariat, it had long been unable to carry out its responsibilities. Since the Central Committee was thus paralyzed, Mao Tse-tung organized a so-called \"Proletarian Headquarters\" to take the place of the original Central Committee Politiburo and its Standing Committee, and the Central Committee Secretariat. These \"headquarters\" comprised Mao Tse-tung and the \"thirteen thugs\" [t'ai-pao]. Among these thirteen thugs — Lin Piao, Chou En-lai, Ch'en Po-ta, K'ang Shen, Chiang Ch'ing, Chang ch'un-ch'iao, Yao Wen-yüan, Hsieh Fu-chih, Huang Yung-sheng, Wu Fa-hsien, Yeh Ch'ün, Wang Tung-hsing, and Wen Yü-ch'eng — eight were not members of the Central Committee and were therefore not genuine, legitimate CCP Central Committee nuclear elements. The reason the Mao Tse-tung clique wanted to convene the Ninth Congress was to formally create a legitimate central leadership organ, that is, transform several nuclear leaders who were originally illegitimate into legitimate nuclear leaders.",
