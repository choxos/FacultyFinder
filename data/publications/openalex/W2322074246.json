The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in erectile function in a large cohort of men undergoing PVP. METHODS The present analysis was conducted on the PVP arm of a non-randomized clinical trial comparing PVP and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). All procedures were performed by a single surgeon using a 120 W GreenLight HPS laser. Subjects completed the Sexual Healthy Inventory for Men (SHIM) and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) questionnaires prior to surgery and at six months postoperatively. All data were collected prospectively and there was no loss to follow-up. Associations between change in SHIM score and other clinical variables were tested using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient for continuous variables and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests for categorical variables. All tests of association were two-sided and performed at a level of significance of 0.05. RESULTS A total of 140 men with a mean age of 67.4 (range 47.8-85.2) years were included in the analysis. Preoperatively, 20 patients (14.3%) had no ED (SHIM≥22), 30 (21.4%) had mild ED (SHIM=17-21), 26 (18.6%) had mild to moderate ED (SHIM=12-16), 18 (12.9%) had moderate ED (SHIM=8-11), and 46 (32.9%) had severe ED (SHIM=1-7). Preoperative SHIM score was negatively correlated with age (Spearman's r=−0.33, p<0.001) but not preoperative IPSS or any other clinical variables. Mean SHIM score decreased by 0.9 points after PVP. However, wide variation was seen, with 54 patients (38.6%) showing an increase, 23 (16.4%) showing no change, and 63 (45.0%) showing a decrease in SHIM score after PVP. The only significant predictor of change in SHIM score was change in IPSS (Spearman's r=−0.18, p=0.03), with men experiencing a greater improvement in voiding symptoms also reporting better postoperative erectile function. There was no significant correlation between change in SHIM score and age (p=0.62), duration of voiding symptoms (p=0.31), preoperative BPH medical therapy (p=0.96), PDE5-inhibitor therapy (p=0.80), or total energy used (p=0.55). CONCLUSIONS Erectile function outcomes following PVP are highly variable but correlate positively with the degree of improvement in voiding function. The biologic mechanisms linking erectile and voiding function are still poorly understood and deserve further study. © 2012 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 187Issue 4SApril 2012Page: e813-e814 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2012 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Piotr Zareba Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Alym Abdulla Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Jim Bowen Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Rob Hopkins Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Jean-Eric Tarride Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author John Paul Whelan Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
