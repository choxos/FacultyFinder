  "title": "Effectiveness and safety of extracorporeal shock wave treatment for low back pain:a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs",
  "abstract": "Abstract Background Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) has been widely used in musculoskeletal disorders. This meta-analysis was designed to assess the effectiveness and safety of ESWT for patients with low back pain (LBP). Methods Multiple electronic databases including Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane’s library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang Data were searched until December, 2019 to identify studies assessing the effectiveness and safety of EPSW for LBP. The prime outcome is pain intensity measured by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or numeric rating scale (NRS). Other outcomes included functional status, quality of life, psychological outcomes measured by Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), as well as the adverse events. Mean differences were calculated for continuous outcomes, while odd ratios were calculated for binary outcomes. Revman 5.3 software was used for statistical analysis. Results Five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled mean difference in post-treatment pain scores was −2.37 (P &lt;0.0001), indicating that post-treatment pain scores was significantly higher by 2.37 in control group than in ESWT group. At a mean follow-up time of 4-6 weeks, the pooled mean difference in ODI scores was −14.10 (P &lt;0.00001), indicating that the pooled mean difference of post-treatment ODI scores was 14.10 higher in control group than in ESWT group. Conclusions The use of focused ESWT is effective in alleviating pain and improving the general fuctional state for patients with LBP. However, more evidence was needed to verify its safety.",
