  "title": "Therapeutic flora in Holy Quran",
  "abstract": "Civilizations have a tendency to revolve around meaningful concepts of a theoretical nature which more than anything else gives them their distinctive character. Such concepts are to be found at the very beginning of a rising civilization or they may signalize, when they first make their appearance, an entirely new departure towards the eventual transformation of the environment generous to them. This signifies a fundamental change in the structure of the civilization in which it happens. They changed their structure, modified their social laws for the well being of coming human race. On scientific grounds modification and edification of old concepts according to Qur&rsquo;anic teachings helped them to emerge as a true modern and civilized society. Among good number of scientific concepts, one is that related to the plants mentioned in the Holy Quran. The history of Islamic medicine started from 2nd century as applied science which provides ample information about the medicinal plants mentioned in the Quran. These medicinal plants continue to be extensively used as major source of drugs for the treatment of many ailments in medieval period. The present research work is a qualitative analysis one which helps to draw attention to the valuable contribution of divine message in the development of medicinal legacy. A comprehensive reform touches all intellectual fields and help in integration of knowledge which requires a combination of operations: the understanding of the text, the understanding of the context/reality, alongside the proper projection of the text on its relevant context. &nbsp; Key words: Civilizations, Prophet Muhammad, Islamic medicine, Holy Quran.",
