  "abstract": "This book could not have been written without the help of a great many people, to whom I am very much indebted.First among these are the participants in the events, Inuit and others, who allowed me to interview them and who exposed their often painful memories to tell the story.Their names are listed in appendix 2, and I am most grateful to them for their time, understanding, and frankness.All the people approached for information were helpful, some for their stories, some for background information or contacts, and some for disabusing my misperceptions or giving a feeling for the flavour of a world I never experienced.Secondly, I am grateful to the people who took part in the questionnaire study in the hamlets.Because of the nature of the study, the participants were anonymous, but I want to thank them, the students who interviewed them, and the staff who made the arrangements and supervised them from the following schools: Qitiqliq School, Arviat; Quqshuun Ilihakvik Centre, Gjoa Haven; the Gordon Robertson Education Centre,",
