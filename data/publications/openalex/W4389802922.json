  "title": "Early Elementary School Interventions in Reading and Mathematics",
  "abstract": "Supplemental special education support in reading and mathematics is essential for some children who struggle to learn basic reading or mathematics skills in their first years of schooling.Previous research shows that supplemental phonics and early numeracy and arithmetic instruction help students at risk for reading or mathematics difficulties.Few intervention studies have been conducted in the Swedish elementary school context evaluating the effectiveness of early reading and mathematics instruction, limiting evidence-based practices guiding special education in Sweden.This thesis aimed to develop and test the impact of two intensive instructional programs on word reading and reading comprehension skills and number knowledge, arithmetic and problem solving.Transfer-effects of training across the reading and mathematics domains and the long-term impact of the programs were also investigated.The study enrolled 753 first grade students who were screened for low performance (≤25 th percentile) in decoding, spelling, number knowledge and arithmetic.To evaluate how the impact of the interventions differ from regular school instruction, students were randomized to intervention and control groups and pre-tested with extended assessment of reading and mathematics skills (n=32 vs. 30 in mathematics, n=34 vs. 34 in reading).Both interventions were implemented at the start of second grade.The intervention programs spanned 36 lessons of supplemental explicit, one-to-one instruction with a special education teacher.Control group students received support planned by their schools.The results were evaluated at post-test and followed-up after 1 year.Both programs indicated significant intervention effects at post-test compared with controls with the reading intervention showing medium impact on decoding and reading comprehension and a strong effect on word recognition.The mathematics intervention program displayed significant moderate impact on number knowledge, arithmetic and basic problem solving.For both interventions, these effects declined at follow-up one year later.In addition, no transfer across reading and mathematics interventions were found.A main conclusion drawn from these randomized controlled studies is that students' performance in basic reading and mathematics can be substantially accelerated by a time-limited and intense effort, adding to the evidence-base of explicit phonics and early numeracy and arithmetic intervention as recommended practices also in a Swedish school context.As many previous studies have shown, intervention gains tend to fade over time.The longevity of intensive intervention impacts should be considered in post-intervention efforts to support learning.Alignment between supplemental programs and general classroom instruction is suggested.",
