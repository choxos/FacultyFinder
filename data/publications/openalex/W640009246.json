  "title": "Against expression : an anthology of conceptual writing",
  "abstract": "In much same way that photography forced painting to move in new directions, advent of World Wide Web, with its proliferation of easily transferable and manipulated text, forces us to think about writing, creativity, and materiality of language in new ways. In Against Expression, editors Craig Dworkin and Kenneth Goldsmith present most innovative works responding to challenges posed by these developments. Charles Bernstein has described conceptual as poetry pregnant with thought. Against Expression, the premier anthology of conceptual writing, presents work that by turns thoughtful, funny, provocative, and disturbing. Dworkin and Goldsmith, two of leading spokespersons and practitioners of conceptual writing, chart trajectory of conceptual aesthetic from early precursors including Samuel Beckett and Marcel Duchamp to most prominent of today s writers. Nearly all of major avant-garde groups of past century are represented here, including Dada, OuLiPo, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, and Flarf to name just a few, but all writers are united in their imaginative appropriation of found and generated texts and their exploration of nonexpressive language. Against Expression is a timely collection and an invaluable resource for readers and writers alike.",
