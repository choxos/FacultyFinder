This report is based on 45 of these patients with microscopic extension of disease beyond the gland and a minimum 5-year followup. Of the patients 22 received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy and 23 did not. The groups were comparable with regard to significant prognostic variables. Patient selection was by surgeon preference. Local recurrences were seen in 1 of 22 patients (5 per cent) receiving adjuvant radiotherapy and 7 of 23 (30 per cent) undergoing an operation alone (p less than 0.05). Of 8 patients with local recurrence 7 died of the disease. Delayed radiotherapy of a local recurrence generally was not effective in controlling the disease. Of the 11 patients who died of prostatic cancer with a mean followup of 9.2 years 3 received adjuvant radiotherapy and 8 did not. Severe but nonfatal long-term complications were seen in 14 per cent of the irradiated patients and 6 per cent of those treated with an operation alone. Most of the complications occurred in the earlier years of the study in patients who received 60 cobalt radiotherapy. When clinical stage B cancer of the prostate is found to be pathological stage C following radical perineal prostatectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy can decrease the incidence of subsequent local recurrence. The potential risk of adjuvant radiation therapy should be weighed and its use considered, particularly in patients whose tumor extends to the surgical margins or who have seminal vesicle invasion.
