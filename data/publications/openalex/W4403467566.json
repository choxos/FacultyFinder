  "title": "Mobilizing pain care knowledge in Canada",
  "abstract": "Mobilizing pain care knowledge in Canada Norm Buckley and Jason Busse from the Michael G. DeGroote Institute for Pain Research &amp; Care discuss the mobilization of knowledge about the pain environment in Canada, focusing on the role of an ad hoc community-based organization. Approximately every quarter, we bring together a wide variety of individuals involved in aspects of pain care, research, education, healthcare delivery, policymaking, and healthcare regulation. An ad hoc group comprised of individuals who see the understanding of pain as important to their work, the CPCF has had a significant impact on the course of pain policy in Canada. It demonstrates the value that can be created by even a small financial and administrative investment in pain-related knowledge mobilization.",
