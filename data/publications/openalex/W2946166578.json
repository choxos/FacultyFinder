  "title": "The Call From the Stranger on a Journey Home: Curriculum as Creative Transformation of Selfhood.",
  "abstract": "Both utilizing and problematizing the notions of stranger, home, journey, and self through cross-cultural inquiry, gender analysis, psychoanalysis, and autobiography, this study attempts to draw a new picture of the human self and a new vision of curriculum. It draws upon the works of three great thinkers: Michel Foucault, a French philosopher; Confucius, an ancient Chinese sage; and Julia Kristeva, a French psychoanalyst. Traveling through a contradictory yet generative space provided by the Foucaultian subject, the Confucian self, and the Kristevian subject, this study intends to address the issues of differences, connections, and creativity in depicting a new landscape of the self to enrich curriculum as a complicated conversation. The creative, transgressive aspect of the Foucaultian subject and the relational, holistic aspect of the Confucian self are taken to the Kristevian notion of woman as a stranger who creates through differences and dynamic relationships. Traveling back and forth between China and the United States, as a woman in the academic field, my journey across the ocean and through different discourses has already put me in an unsettling position, in contradiction, and in a situation of \"aporia.\" My own experiencing of ambiguity and paradox makes me less interested in building the bridge between and among contradictions than in embracing \"aporia,\" in a journey of creating third spaces and new subjectivities. Such a journey enables me to understand curriculum as a continuous process of reaching out for other worlds and then returning to the self with new gifts of life.",
