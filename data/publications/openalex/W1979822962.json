  "title": "Anthropology and the theorisation of citizenship",
  "abstract": "Abstract In this paper I argue for the importance of theorising citizenship as an independent axis of social inequality in the contemporary world. As a foil, I take two intertwined tendencies within anthropological writings on migration. First is the historical trend of anthropology as a discipline to theorise against the grain of the nation-state. Second is the tendency within anthropological studies of transnationalism and migration to theorise their subject in terms of Marxian understandings of class and exploitation or in terms of the intersecting dimensions of race, class and gender (but not citizenship). The result of these approaches is to elide the role of national boundaries and citizenship as significant theoretical objects in themselves. To build my approach, I contrast the production of migrant 'illegality' in three national contexts: the United States, China and Australia. Keywords: CitizenshipInequalityPolitical EconomyUSAChinaAustralia Acknowledgments I thank audiences at the University of Californiaâ€“Berkeley and Peking University, members of my writing group Tamara Jacka, Francesca Merlan, Alan Rumsey and Don Gardner, three anonymous reviewers for TAPJA, Luke Hambly and especially Katherine Robinson for their questions, advice and input. Notes The literature on the household registration laws in China is vast. For a start, see Solinger (), Kipnis (), Cheng and Selden (), Potter () and Wang (). Similar systems exist(ed) in many present and past socialist countries. Under the new legislative regime of the 'Pacific Solution', two further temporary visa classes were added. Refugees who had been granted a TPV and had not applied for permanent protection before September 2001 were now precluded from doing so. Refugees who had spent seven days in a country where they could have sought 'effective protection' en route to Australia also became ineligible for permanent protection. In short, refugees granted TPVs since 2001 would not have the right to apply for permanent protection (Marston , p.15). Saskia Sassen's wonderful book on the history of migrations and migration policy in Europe (1999) provides a model for the usefulness of such a strategy and also demonstrates that most of these dilemmas have a long history in Europe as well. In China, migrants from rural areas are often disparaged in a eugenics-inspired discourse that constructs them as racially inferior to urban residents. While the literature on meanings and logics of citizenship is too vast to enter here, Goldman and Perry () offer an excellent discussion of the changing meanings of citizenship in China. This definition of class is developed in Kipnis (forthcoming). It is more Weberian than Marxian, but has its deepest roots in Durkheim. Many describe this link in terms of the 'trinity of language, birth and soil' (for example, Solomon , p. 418). While this trinity may be an apt enough description of many forms of popular ideology, it elides the important facts of naturalised citizenship and multilingual nations. In countries like Australia and the United States, where the benefits of permanent residency approach those of full citizenship, this responsibility would have to be extended even to those with permanent residency. By bare life, Agamben means the life of the outsider, the non-citizen, the life which, in ancient Greece, could be taken but not sacrificed and thus lacked political citizenship. The unwillingness of wealthy nations, especially the United States and Australia, to abide by international instruments (like those that define the rights of refugees) is another aspect of how the 'democracy' of wealthy nations does little to promote democracy on a global scale. Even some forms of legal labour migration, such as that of Indonesian domestic servants in the Middle East, produce conditions that amount to a form of indenture.
