  "title": "Physicianship: Educating for Professionalism in the Post-Flexnarian Era",
  "abstract": "Although he did not write extensively about professionalism, Abraham Flexner clearly understood its critical role in medical practice. In discerning the basics of medical education he characterized scientific methodology as the instrumental minimum. He left open to future generations the task of defining its necessary complement, the \"noble behaviors and fine feelings\" required of the medical practitioner. Situated within the current professionalism movement, and informed by previous commentary on the enduring attributes of medicine, a curriculum based on \"Physicianship\"--the physician as healer and professional--can serve as a logical post-Flexnerian curriculum. The conceptual armature of Physicianship and the attributes necessary for the fulfillment of both the professional and healer role can assist in the selection of students and constitute the educational blueprint for medical teaching. The critically important concepts of identity formation and the requirements for the valid and reliable assessment of professional behaviors of students and faculty are essential components. A Physicianship curriculum, as conceived and deployed at the McGill University Faculty of Medicine, might resonate with Flexner.",
