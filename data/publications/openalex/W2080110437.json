METHODS The validated DAN-PSS questionnaire was used for assessment of bother of 12 different LUTS, among 6,000 subjects, randomly drawn from the national population register. Among symptomatic subjects, the proportion of individuals with at least moderate bother was calculated for each symptom (individual level) (Fig. 1). The age-standardised prevalence of subjects with at least moderate bother was also calculated for each symptom (population level) (Fig. 2). To asses statistical significance, 95% confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS Out of 6,000 subjects, 3,727 (62.4%) took part. The LUTS with the greatest bother burden at the population level were: urgency (7.9% prevalence, with at least moderately bothersome), stress urinary incontinence (SUI) (6.5%), nocturia (6.0%), post-micturition dribble (5.8%), urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) (5.0%) and daytime frequency (4.3%). Among symptomatic subjects, UUI was the most bothersome LUTS. No differences between sexes in the perceived bother were found from an individual perspective, whereas the population bother burden from urinary incontinence was higher in women than men, and vice versa for voiding and post-micturition symptoms. (Figs. 1-2) CONCLUSIONS Individuals of both sexes who experience UUI are more likely to rate it as moderately or very bothersome, compared with other LUTS. At the population level, the most prevalent bothersome symptoms are post-micturition dribble, urgency and nocturia among men, and SUI, urgency and UUI among women. Overall, UUI is the most bothersome LUTS from the individual perspective and urgency from the population perspective. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 185Issue 4SApril 2011Page: e782 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Kari A.O.
