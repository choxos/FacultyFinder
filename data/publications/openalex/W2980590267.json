  "title": "P075 STI and HIV infections among MSM reporting exposure to gonorrhea or chlamydia: implications for expedited partner therapy",
  "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Expedited partner therapy (EPT) is not recommended for U.S. men who have sex with men (MSM), due, in part, to concerns that STI and HIV infections may remain undiagnosed in EPT-treated partners who do not seek medical attention. To estimate how often infections might be missed, we assessed bacterial STI and new HIV diagnoses among MSM presenting as contacts to <i>Chlamydia trachomatis</i> (Ct) or <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> (GC). <h3>Methods</h3> MSM attending New York City sexual health clinics are routinely tested for HIV, syphilis, and urogenital and extra-genital Ct and GC. We measured the number and percent of visits, during 2016â€“2018, with diagnoses of new HIV infection, or alternate/additional bacterial STI, among MSM who had: reported contact to STI, a clinician diagnosis of contact to GC or CT, and no reported contact to syphilis. <h3>Results</h3> A total of 3,549 MSM had 4,390 visits eligible for analysis. Overall, 14.6% (640/4,390) visits resulted in bacterial STI diagnoses other than those to which exposure was reported. Among MSM-visits for exposure to Ct-only, 12.4% (177/1,430) resulted in GC diagnoses (including 81 rectal GC infections). Syphilis was diagnosed at 4.4% (159/3,652) of visits for Ct or GC exposure (49 primary/secondary, 49 early latent, 61 late latent). Twenty-eight new HIV diagnoses were made (3 acute, 25 non-acute infections); 8 among visits for Ct-only exposure, 20 for GC exposure. <h3>Conclusion</h3> MSM reporting contact to Ct or GC, have other, concurrent bacterial STI that will be inadequately treated with therapy directed at only the STI to which they report exposure. A substantial number of HIV infections may remain undiagnosed if sex partners to MSM with Ct and GC do not receive HIV testing. Opportunities to offer HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis may also be missed. Our findings support examining and testing MSM exposed to Ct or GC rather than using EPT. <h3>Disclosure</h3> No significant relationships.",
