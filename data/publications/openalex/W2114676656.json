  "title": "The Affinity of a Major Ca2+ Binding Site on GRP78 Is Differentially Enhanced by ADP and ATP",
  "abstract": "GRP78 is a major protein regulated by the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress response, and up-regulation has been shown to be important in protecting cells from challenge with cytotoxic agents. GRP78 has ATPase activity, acts as a chaperone, and interacts specifically with other proteins, such as caspases, as part of a mechanism regulating apoptosis. GRP78 is also reported to have a possible role as a Ca2+ storage protein. In order to understand the potential biological effects of Ca2+ and ATP/ADP binding on the biology of GRP78, we have determined its ligand binding properties. We show here for the first time that GRP78 can bind Ca2+, ATP, and ADP, each with a 1:1 stoichiometry, and that the binding of cation and nucleotide is cooperative. These observations do not support the hypothesis that GRP78 is a dynamic Ca2+ storage protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that whereas Mg2+ enhances GRP78 binding to ADP and ATP to the same extent, Ca2+ shows a differential enhancement. In the presence of Ca2+, the KD for ATP is lowered ∼11-fold, and the KD for ADP is lowered around 930-fold. The KD for Ca2+ is lowered ∼40-fold in the presence of ATP and around 880-fold with ADP. These findings may explain the biological requirement for a nucleotide exchange factor to remove ADP from GRP78. Taken together, our data suggest that the Ca2+-binding property of GRP78 may be part of a signal transduction pathway that modulates complex interactions between GRP78, ATP/ADP, secretory proteins, and caspases, and this ultimately has important consequences for cell viability.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. 3The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; DSC, differential scanning calorimetry; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry. of eukaryotic cells is the site where secreted proteins and proteins targeted to the plasma membrane and secretory organelles are folded and processed. These proteins are translocated into the ER lumen, where they fold correctly. Correct protein folding is of great importance to the health of the cell, so signaling pathways that monitor the ER environment have developed. These pathways monitor the levels of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the ER lumen and transmit signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus, giving rise to what is termed the ER stress or unfolded protein response (1Chen X. Shen J. Prywes R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13045-13052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 2Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Nutrient limitation in cell culture can invoke a subset of the ER stress response with glucose starvation, causing what is termed the glucose-regulated stress response. The glucose-regulated stress response leads to the induction of ER resident proteins referred to as the glucose-regulated proteins. Glucose-regulated proteins are calcium-binding chaperone proteins, a well characterized example being GRP78. This protein is known to form complexes with heterologous proteins that are processed through the ER and has been shown to bind Ca2+ (3Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev.

GRP78 is a member of the Hsp70 protein family and is widely distributed, being found mainly within the ER lumen but also in the cytoplasm and on the cell surface (6Mintz P.J. Kim J. Do K.A. Wang X.

Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar).Calcium ions are important intracellular messengers that travel from intracellular Ca2+ stores (e.g. the ER) and their target proteins located in the cytosol, the mitochondria, or the nucleus (9Demaurex N. Frieden M. Arnaudeau S. Eggleton P. Michalak M. Calreticulin. 2nd Ed. Springer, Berlin, Germany2003: 134-142Google Scholar). It has been proposed that tidal patterns of Ca2+ flux in and out of the ER could contribute to the regulation of protein secretion (10Sambrook J.F. Cell. 1990; 61: 197-199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The storage of Ca2+ is highly regulated, because high concentrations can be toxic; therefore, cells typically make use of calcium storage proteins such as calsequestrins and calreticulins, which are characterized by high capacity but low affinity for Ca2+ ions (11Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The biological significance of the Ca2+ binding ability associated with GRP78 has been the subject of conjecture. GRP78 has been ascribed a direct and important role in the storage of the rapidly exchanging pool of Ca2+ and reported to have a stoichiometry of 1-2 mol of calcium/mol of GRP78 under resting conditions (5Lievremont J.P. Rizzuto R. Hendershot L. Meldolesi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30873-30879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), whereas other reports (9Demaurex N. Frieden M. Arnaudeau S. Eggleton P. Michalak M. Calreticulin. 2nd Ed. Springer, Berlin, Germany2003: 134-142Google Scholar) state that GRP78 is able to bind large quantities of Ca2+.Prolonged ER stress can lead to cell death by inducing the programmed cell death (apoptosis) pathway. Apoptosis plays an essential role in the normal development of multicellular organisms and in the homeostasis of adult tissues (12Horvitz H.R. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1701s-1706sPubMed Google Scholar, 13Jacobson M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 347-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2396) Google Scholar, 14Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). The pathways leading to apoptosis are controlled by a series of signal transduction cascades, and alterations to these pathways have been implicated in many disease states, including cancer and neurodegenerative conditions (15Chai J. Shiozaki E. Srinivasula S.M. Wu Q. Datta P. Alnemri E.S. Shi Y. Dataa P. Cell. 2001; 104: 769-780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar, 16Thompson C.B.

The mechanism of apoptosis is conserved across species and is mediated by a group of cysteine proteases called caspases (18Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Wong W.W. Yuan J. Cell. 1996; 87: 171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2132) Google Scholar). Each of these proteases is synthesized as an inactive proenzyme that is proteolytically cleaved to produce the active form. GRP78 forms complexes with caspase-7 and -12 in the ER compartment, implying that this complex formation prevents release of caspase-12 from the ER (19Rao R.V. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P.C. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). The complex between GRP78 and caspase-12 is sensitive to the addition of ATP and dATP in a cell extract-based system (19Rao R.V. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P.C. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Deletion of the GRP78 ATP binding domain prevents binding to procaspase-7 and results in loss of the protective effects against etoposide-induced apoptosis. Similarly, a missense mutation in the ATP domain that prevents ATP binding causes loss of ability to protect against ER stress and against etoposide-induced apoptosis (4Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 20Morris J.A. Dorner A.J. Edwards C.A. Hendershot L.M. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4327-4334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These observations imply that the binding of relatively small effector molecules such as ATP can modulate the protein binding abilities of GRP78. Studies using overexpression or up-regulation of GRP78 or the use of antisense grp78 RNA show that GRP78 can protect against cell death caused by disturbance of ER homeostasis (4Reddy R.K. Mao C. Baumeister P. Austin R.C. Kaufman R.J. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20915-20924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 21Xu W. Liu L. Charles I.G. Moncada S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1129-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar).Although primarily located within the ER lumen, in response to the addition of ER stress inducers to cell cultures, subpopulations of GRP78 have been reported to redistribute to the cytoplasm and the ER membrane (19Rao R.V. Peel A. Logvinova A. del Rio G. Hermel E. Yokota T. Goldsmith P.C. Ellerby L.M. Ellerby H.M. Bredesen D.E. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). However, these data were unable to distinguish between true redistribution or an effect of up-regulation.Given the previously published data that show that GRP78 interacts with Ca2+ and nucleotides (discussed above), we wished to address the hypothesis that GRP78 acts a dynamic Ca2+ storage protein and that the binding of Ca2+ may be modulated by the binding of nucleotides. To do this, we chose to use a quantitative thermodynamic approach utilizing microcalorimetry. We report here for the first time a quantitative analysis of Ca2+, ADP, and ATP binding to wild type and a fully functional and widely used mutant (G565R) (22King L.S. Berg M. Chevalier M. Carey A. Elguindi E.C. Blond S.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) of mouse GRP78 and show that Ca2+, ADP, and ATP bind cooperatively. Using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), we show that in the absence of ADP or ATP GRP78 binds Ca2+ weakly with a KD of ∼0.7 mm. Using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that in the presence of ADP or ATP, GRP78 is able to bind a single Ca2+ ion and that the KD values for Ca2+ binding are ∼40-fold lower in the presence of saturating levels of ATP and 880-fold lower in the presence of ADP. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we show that in the presence of Ca2+, the KD for ATP is lowered ∼11-fold and that calculations based on data we report here predict a lowering of around 930-fold in the KD for ADP. We further show that ATP or ADP binding to a single site within GRP78 is accompanied by conformational changes that can be detected by CD measurements. Taken together, these observations suggest that the Ca2+ binding properties of GRP78 may be part of a mechanism regulating the interaction between GRP78 and ADP/ATP. This in turn has consequences for the way GRP78 may interact with caspases, resulting ultimately in either cell survival or cell death.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Chemicals and solvents were purchased from local suppliers and were of AnalaR or greater purity.

At midlog growth phase, the cultures were made 0.2 mg ml-1 with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the incubation continued for a further 5 h when the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. Harvested cells were stored at -18 °C until needed, when they were thawed on ice, and ∼50 g of cells were sonicated in 500 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 8.0 (buffer 1). The sonicated material was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 40 min, and the decanted supernatant was loaded onto a 25-ml Probond column. The column was then washed with 500 ml of buffer 1 and subsequently eluted with a 1-liter 0.0-0.3 m imidazole gradient in buffer 1, collecting 10-ml fractions. GRP78-containing fractions were located by SDS-PAGE analysis, and appropriate fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 2× 5-liter changes of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (buffer 2). Using an ÄKTA explorer, the dialyzed pool of protein was then loaded in sixths onto a Mono Q HR 10/10 FPLC column. The column was then washed with 3 column volumes of buffer 2 and eluted with a 20-column volume gradient of 0.0-1.0 m NaCl in buffer 2, collecting 2-ml fractions at a flow rate of 2.5 ml min-1. GRP78-containing fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE and showed that it eluted as two overlapping peaks. Samples from each peak were then analyzed by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column using a buffer consisting of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 150 mm NaCl (buffer 3). Samples from the first peak were found to elute as a single peak from the column at an estimated molecular mass of ∼70 kDa, whereas the second peak showed two species eluting at estimated masses of 70 and >200 kDa. The fractions from the MonoQ column containing the first peak of GRP78 were pooled and pressure-concentrated to a volume of 25 ml. The concentrated pool was loaded on to a Sephacryl S300 column of dimensions 115 × 2.5 cm that had been previously equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.75 m NaCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol (buffer 4). GRP78-containing fractions were located by SDS-PAGE, pooled, and dialyzed against 3× 5-liter changes of buffer 2. The dialyzed protein was then loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column of dimensions 6.5 × 5 cm, washed with 450 ml of buffer 2, and the column was eluted with a 50-400 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.2, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol) gradient. GRP78-containing fractions were located by SDS-PAGE and pooled, with a typical preparation yielding ∼125 mg of GRP78 at a purity greater than 95%. The affinity of the protein for Ca2+ (as measured by DSC) was used as a quality control assay for protein purification. GRP78 purified by this method was found to greatly reduce batch to batch variation (up to a 2-fold difference in the KD for Ca2+ binding) found when alternative purification protocols were used. The cDNA sequences encoding GRP78 in plasmids pHis6-Bip (wild type GRP78) and pHis6-BiP:G565R were determined by direct sequence analysis and were identical to that published previously (24Blond-Elguindi S.

Suppl. 1989; 11: 115-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—The observed change in the tertiary structure of GRP78 in the presence of ATP or ADP was probed by near-UV CD spectroscopy. Near-UV CD spectra were recorded from an average of five cumulative scans at 20 °C from 320 to 250 nm using a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter. Samples of GRP78 in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol were used at concentrations between 8 and 12 μm. The change in the near-UV signal was monitored by the addition of ATP or ADP in the final concentration range 0-100 μm. The change in the near-UV signal was also monitored in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 by the addition of ATP in the final concentration range 0-80 μm. Each set of ATP or ADP titrations was carried out in triplicate, and each spectrum was base line-corrected by subtraction of a comparative blank. Similarly, ATP titrations were carried in triplicate in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2. The 265 nm reading for each titration was used to calculate the KD for binding ATP or ADP in the absence of CaCl2 and ATP in the presence of CaCl2. The 265 nm readings for each sample were corrected by subtracting the 265 nm reading in the absence of ATP or ADP from each of the readings in the data set. The corrected 265 nm data were fitted to a single-site model, by nonlinear least-squares regression, using Scientist as described in Ref. 26Reid S.L. Parry D. Liu H.H. Connolly B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2484-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar. Control experiments were carried out, titrating GTP into GRP78 in the concentration range 0-80 μm and CaCl2 into Grp78 in the concentration range 0-8 mm, and no change in near-UV CD signal at 265 nm was observed.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a nondestructive and noninvasive (label-free) technique that can be used to give a direct measure of the KD and additionally provides information on the enthalpy (ΔH) and stoichiometry (n) of ligand binding. In these ITC experiments, a protein solution is placed in a reaction vessel, and ligands are titrated in from a syringe while constantly stirring the mixture. Any heat absorbed (endothermic reaction) or released (exothermic reaction) when ligand binds to the protein is measured directly. Standard Gibbs free energy (ΔG0) and entropy (ΔS0) of ligand binding are subsequently calculated from the following equations. ΔG0=-RT·lnKb=+RT·lnKD=ΔH-T·ΔS0ITC experiments were performed at 25 °C using a high precision VP-ITC system (Microcal Inc.). GRP78 was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol. The concentrations of GRP78, nucleotides, and CaCl2 used in the injector and cell are shown in Table 3. The heat evolved following each 10-μl injection was obtained from the integral of the calorimetric signal. The heat due to the binding reaction was obtained as the difference between the heat of reaction and the corresponding heat of dilution. Analyses of data were performed using Microcal Origin software.TABLE 3Thermodynamic parameters for the binding of combinations of Ca2+ ADP and ATP to G565R and wild type GRP78 as determined by ITC at 25 °CLigand tested[Ligand] in syringe[GRP78] in cellnKD(app)Average KD(app)ΔHobsΔS0cμMμMkcal mol−1cal K−1 mol−1Ca2+ binding to wild type GRP78 in the presence of ATP1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP36 μm + 1 mm ATP1.0 (0.1)14.417.9 ± 31.7 (0.1)27.92.51 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP36 μm + 1 mm ATP1.1 (0.1)20.61.6 (0.1)26.91.81.2 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP36 μm + 1 mm ATP1.0 (0.1)18.71.8 (0.1)27.51.9Ca2+ binding to wild type GRP78 in the presence of ADP1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP36 μm + 1 mm ADP0.8 (0.1)0.70.8 ± 0.1−5.4 (0.1)9.7400.5 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP36 μm + 1 mm ADP0.7 (0.1)0.9−5.5 (0.1)9.8540.5 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP27 μm + 1 mm ADP0.8 (0.1)0.9−5.1 (0.1)10.022.5ADP binding to wild type GRP781 mm ADP27 μm0.7 (0.1)2.72.5 ± 0.4−10.2 (0.1)−8.89.51 mm ADP27 μm0.8 (0.1)2.0−9.5 (0.1)−5.8121 mm ADP27 μm0.8 (0.1)2.8−9.0 (0.1)−5.09.2Ca2+ binding to G565R GRP78 in the presence of ATP1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP41 μm + 1 mm ATP1.2 (0.1)18.920.1 ± 2.82.7 (0.2)30.62.30.75 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP34 μm + 1 mm ATP1.0 (0.1)18.04.0 (0.2)35.11.90.65 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ATP34 μm + 1 mm ATP1.0 (0.1)23.34.2 (0.5)35.61.5Ca2+ binding to G565R GRP78 in the presence of ADP1 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP34 μm + 1 mm ADP0.9 (0.1)2.42.2 ± 0.3−2.9 (0.1)16.113.81 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP34 μm + 1 mm ADP0.9 (0.1)2.2−2.9 (0.1)16.218.81 mm CaCl2 + 1 mm ADP34 μm + 1 mm ADP0.9 (0.1)1.9−2.8 (0.01)16.815.3ADP binding to G565R GRP781 mm ADP40 μm1.0 (0.1)1.71.4 ± 0.3−9.4 (0.1)−5.223.60.8 mm ADP40 μm0.9 (0.1)1.2−10.0 (0.1)−6.934.50.5 mm ADP40 μm1.0 (0.1)1.2−10.5 (0.1)−8.132.2 Open table in a new tab Differential Scanning Calorimetry—DSC is a sensitive technique that measures the heat energy uptake (excess heat capacity) during thermally induced transitions in solution. In the case of proteins, analysis of the DSC thermogram can give detailed information about the mechanism of the unfolding transition, including the level of cooperativity, reversibility, and number of domains involved, together with the effects of bound ligands. DSC data can be used to give two independent estimates of the thermodynamic enthalpy (heat energy uptake) associated with the unfolding transition; the calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) derives from the integrated area under a thermogram peak and is an absolute measure that depends on the concentration and integrity of the protein sample, whereas the van't Hoff enthalpy (ΔHVH) depends only on the shape of the transition (29Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B. Morimoto R. Joachimiak A. Structure. 1997; 5: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Cooper A. Allen G. Protein: A Comprehensive Treatise. 2. JAI Press Inc, Stamford, CT1999: 217-270Google Scholar). In ideal circumstances, these quantities are the same, and the calorimetric/van't Hoff enthalpy ratio is close to unity. Deviations from this behavior indicate the presence of impure or misfolded protein, irreversibility, and/or lack of cooperativity in the unfolding transition. Binding of ligands to the native protein will naturally stabilize the folded form, and this will be manifest in an observed increase in the midpoint temperature (Tm) for the protein (or domain) involved in the transition. For a ligand that binds to the native (folded) state of a protein, the increase in Tm can be related to the dissociation constant (KD) and concentration of ligand, [L], as shown in the following equation (29Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B. Morimoto R. Joachimiak A. Structure. 1997; 5: 403-414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 30Cooper A. Allen G.

Protein was dialyzed into 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and the dialysis buffer was retained to dissolve ligands and for base line controls. Each sample was heated from 25 to 32 °C and cooled to 25 °C and then heated from 25 to 80 °C. Deconvolution analysis was performed using the non-two-state model provided with Microcal Origin software.Protein Concentrations—Protein concentrations were measured spectrophotometrically as described previously (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H.

Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5031) Google Scholar), using the theoretical molar absorption coefficient calculated by the Vector Nti suite of programs and will therefore have an error of up to 5%.SDS-PAGE Analysis of Proteins—SDS-PAGE, using a 10% acrylamide separating gel, was carried out as previously described (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206225) Google Scholar).RESULTSPurification and Characterization of the Wild Type and G565R Forms of GRP78—Overproduction of the wild type untagged GRP78 protein has previously been reported to be toxic to E. coli, whereas overproduction of a His6-tagged form is less toxic and overproduction of a His6-tagged G565R mutant form is nontoxic (22King L.S. Berg M. Chevalier M. Carey A. Elguindi E.C. Blond S.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The functional integrity of the G565R GRP78 was previously assessed by ATPase activity in the presence of the peptide LSVKFLT and the ability to interact with the J-domain of the DnaJ-like accessory protein MYJ1 and found to have near wild type values (22King L.S. Berg M. Chevalier M. Carey A. Elguindi E.C. Blond S.Y. Protein Expression Purif. 2001; 22: 148-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Since we wished to carry out a full thermodynamic analysis of Ca2+ and nucleotide binding to GRP78, we initiated studies with the G565R mutant form, since this had been reported to be overproduced at a higher level. In order to be confident that the properties of the mutant form were functionally equivalent to the wild type, we planned to purify a small quantity of the wild type protein for a limited comparative analysis. However, under our induction conditions, the wild type His6-tagged GRP78 was not toxic in E. coli, and we were able to purify it in the same quantities as the G565R form. Therefore, we carried out a full comparison of wild type and G565R GRP78 to assess whether the G565R mutation had any significant effects on the binding of Ca2+ and nucleotides. Wild type and G565R GRP78 were purified using the protocol described under \"Experimental Procedures.\" Fig. 1 shows examples of both forms of the protein analyzed by SDS-PAGE. These proteins were compared by far-UV CD analysis and found to be indistinguishable (data not shown). Table 1 shows that independent preparations of both forms of GRP78 purified by this method showed good agreement in terms of the positions of the peaks of the thermal transitions revealed by DSC.TABLE 1Thermodynamic parameters for the unfolding of wild type and G565R GRP78 as determined by DSC in the absence of ligandsSampleTm1ΔHcal1ΔHvh1Tm2ΔHcal2ΔHvh2°Ckcal mol−1kcal mol−1°Ckcal mol−1kcal mol−1Wild type GRP7846.2 (0.5)151 (10)153 (2)67.0 (0.1)125 (5)167 (5)G565R GRP7846.6 (0.2)154 (2)154 (2)66.0 (0.3)128 (9)138 (1) Open table in a new tab Differential Scanning Calorimetry Reveals that GRP78 Unfolds as Two Independent Domains—The purified GRP78 proteins underwent two thermal transitions, and a typical thermogram of unliganded wild type GRP78 is shown in Fig. 2A. Fig. 2B shows an unfolding of the first domain, and a second heating shown in Fig. 2C shows that the unfolding of this domain is partially reversible. This sample was reheated for a third time (Fig. 2D) and again shows the partial reversibility of refolding of the first domain and independent unfolding of the second domain. The sequential scans in Fig. 2, B-D, show that for wild type GRP78 protein, the unfolding of the two domains is independent. However, when GRP78 is heated from 25 to 80 °C (Fig. 2E) and then reheated (Fig. 2F), the unfolding of both domains shows little reversibility. The same unfolding and refolding pattern was observed with G565R mutant GRP78 (data not shown). Table 1 shows that for the G565R GRP78 protein in the unliganded state for both thermal transitions, the ratio of the calorimetric to van't Hoff enthalpies approximates unity. This is consistent with cooperative unfolding of a monomeric protein unit. This ratio deviated from unity for the second transition of the wild type protein. The data in Table 1 also show that the Tm for the first transition is essentially identical for the wild type and mutant proteins and that there is an incre",
