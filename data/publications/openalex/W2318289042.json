  "title": "Executive Function Coaching: Assisting With Transitioning From Secondary to Postsecondary Education",
  "abstract": "ADHD is defined as impairment to self-regulatory behavior and executive functioning (EF). Many students with other learning disabilities (LD) also experience EF impairments. With the rising number of students with ADHD and LD enrolling in higher education, it is important to recognize the challenges these students face and to provide effective support when transitioning from secondary to postsecondary school. This article examines the challenges of the transition from secondary to postsecondary environments, specifically with the student diagnosed with ADHD and/or other LD.Scholarly articles relating to the efficacy of EF coaching as well as students with ADHD and/or other LD transitioning from secondary to postsecondary school were examined and then considered for best practices in EF coaching.Although the literature supports that EF coaching can improve EF skills, there is a paucity of empirical studies that examines the efficacy of EF coaching (Franklin & Franklin, 2012). The literature also supports the use of EF coaching for students with ADHD and/or LD when transitioning from highschool to college, however limited research has been published to date.With the finite research available in the field of coaching, recommendations for future consideration and research is included to support the need for evidence-based programs. An EF coaching model at Lynn University's Institute for Achievement and Learning (IAL) is discussed and addresses how students are supported during their first year at the University.",
