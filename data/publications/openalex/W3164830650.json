In the human body, hormones are chemical messengers, released by specialized cells, that journey through the bloodstream, controlling functional activities of targets throughout the body. They are generated by a variety of tissues in the endocrine system, the last body system to be discovered. This opportunity to meet your hormones is facilitated by Whitlock and Temple’s captivating explanations that introduce their readers to the different types of hormones (proteins, peptides, steroids, and amines), their molecular structures, molecular size variations, manufacture, evolution, functions, techniques of action and interaction, and the ways they help to organize and manage the lives of humans as well as animals, plants, and even microorganisms. Hormones are related to or involved in numerous actions that people experience, even if they are not aware of them. Among many... You do not currently have access to this content.",
