The role of decision-aids in facilitating these decisions is unknown. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of decision aids for localized prostate cancer. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane databases, without language limits up to August 2014. We performed screening, data extraction, risk of bias and quality assessments in duplicate, independently. We sent our data extraction to the original authors for verification. We analyzed treatment effects between decision aids and usual care using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects inverse variance method for continuous outcomes and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method for treatment choice. RESULTS Of 2,737 reports, 14 RCTs proved eligible (n=3,377 men). Of these, 11 RCTs compared decision aids to usual care and 3 to other decision aids. Overall, 12 RCTs were at high risk of bias; only 2 were at low risk of bias. We evaluated 9 decision aids provided by authors. Decision aids reported positive and negative consequences of alternative management strategies well (9 of 9, 100%) but presented event rates less frequently (56%), and did not typically make direct comparison of probabilities possible (33%). Two trials suggested a modest positive reduction in decisional regret (Figure). Results varied widely for decisional conflict (4 trials), satisfaction with decision (2 trials) and knowledge (2 trials). We found no impact on treatment choices (6 trials) (Figure). A values clarification exercise was associated with a reduction in regret and improved preparation for decision making. The decision aids tested in these trials were designed to provide patients with information to prepare for the clinical encounter. No decision aid was primarily designed for use in the clinical encounter and no trial directly assessed the impact of the decision aid on collaborative deliberation and shared decision making. CONCLUSIONS Limited evidence suggests variable impact of existing decision aids on a limited set of decisional processes and outcomes. Work in this area would benefit from user-centered design of decision aids that promote shared decision making. © 2015 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 193Issue 4SApril 2015Page: e516-e517 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2015 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Philippe D.
