  "title": "Don't Count Your Chickens... The Importance of Planning When Making Heavy Oil Decisions",
  "abstract": "One of the most frequently quoted English sayings is, “Don’t count your chickens before they’re hatched.” In other words, do not assume that you will get the things that you want until you have them. Certainly this old idiom can be applied to a range of situations, including heavy oil production. When making decisions about heavy oil, testing, evaluation and planning are essential. Pilot studies provide an insight into reservoir behaviour enabling oil and gas companies to characterize a reservoir and manage it more effectively. For example, crucial knowledge can be gained, such as the depletion profile and by-passed oil zones, oil and water zonal contribution, reservoir pressures, cross-flow, well integrity (cement and casing) and potential issues with commingled flow. When the time comes to make key decisions, such as well placement or completion design, operators with the most accurate picture of their reservoir will make the best choices for their wells and surface facilities. By knowing more about a reservoir, a more accurate timeline can be drawn up and the correct follow-up production method can be decided, thereby, enhancing overall recovery. The improved ability to predict how a reservoir will behave benefits every decision-maker on the project team, from the geologist and production engineers to the asset manager. The time and money operators invest in the beginning to learn about the reservoir will pay off many times in the end. This is especially important in today’s economic climate. Further efficiencies are evident when the pilot study is integrated into the heavy oil production process. By conducting a pilot study, an existing model can be built, tested and improved accordingly. Making continuous improvements and constantly learning about the reservoir will ultimately decrease the time that it takes to get to full production capacity. This will lead to a more efficient way of planning production facilities in the long-term. Moin Khan is Technical Manager for the Production Services Group located in Houston, Texas. This group is responsible for designing, building and operating oil and gas production facilities. He began working for Schlumberger in 1995, and has undertaken many roles including Technical Support Manager, Global Accounts & Special Projects Manager and Manager of the Project Management & Engineering Group. Moin graduated from the University of Karachi, Pakistan with a B.S. in mechanical engineering. Testing, Testing, Testing...",
