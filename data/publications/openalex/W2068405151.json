Accurate estimates of progression and remission proportions for nocturia without treatment would facilitate the decision making of therapy. We evaluated the fluctuation of nocturia over 1 year follow-up among patients allocated to placebo within a randomized trial. METHODS Secondary analysis from a double-blind, randomized trial which recruited men (31 participating centers) aged 45-80 who had symptoms suggestive of BPH. To be eligible, a man had to have score >8 in the AUA-SI. At six visits over one year of follow-up, participants reported their average nocturia episodes over the past week (visits at weeks 2, 4, 13, 26, 39, and 52). Number of nocturia episodes as a response variable was modeled using generalized linear mixed model. We assumed Poisson distribution with log link function. Week was used both as categorical and continuous fixed explanatory variable. Inference was based on estimates of fixed effects and their 95% confidence intervals. RESULTS Altogether 305 men (mean age 65 years) were allocated to placebo. Of these, 256 (84%) reported information for all 6 time points. There was considerable fluctuation in nocturia over 1 year. Most men with 1 or 2 nocturia episodes at baseline reported similar nocturia severity at 1 year, but approximately half of men with 3 or 4 episodes (at baseline) had improvement in episodes and relatively few had worsening at 1 year. Overall, no significant differences in episodes were found at any of the weeks (p for all >0.399) and no significant trend was found (p=0.542). CONCLUSIONS Among care-seeking men randomized to placebo treatment, no significant progression of nocturia at one year follow up was observed. For men with >3 voids/night, approximately half could expect to have symptom improvement at one year, although only a very small minority would experience complete remission. This study provides reassuring data when counseling patients about fluctuations in nocturia when treating BPH with watchful waiting. © 2012 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 187Issue 4SApril 2012Page: e502-e503 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2012 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Kari A.O.
