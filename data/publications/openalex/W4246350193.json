  "abstract": "DIABETES MELLITUS IN RELATION TO MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE Pathan Amanulla Khan*, B. B. Sarah Nousheen, Khateeja Sultana, Mohd. Hussain Hyder, Hifsa Umama Anwarul Uloom College of Pharmacy, Hyderabad, Telangana, India ABSTRACT The World Health Organization (WHO) defines diabetes as a chronic disease caused by inherited or acquired deficiency in the production of insulin or by the ineffectiveness of insulin produced, causing hyperglycemia and further end organ damage. The terms ‘diabetes’ and ‘mellitus’ were coined by Aretaeus of Cappadocia and Willis. T respectively. Human insulin was discovered by Banting, Best and Collip in 1921-1922. This was followed by the discovery of oral hypoglycemic agents, which dramatically modified the existing management strategies of diabetes, aiding in improving overall patient well-being. However, despite these advancements, the disease is rapid in its growth, with an estimated global increase to 625 million cases by 2045; the prevalence in India, the second most diabetes populous country, is estimated to rise to 151 million by 2045. Major factors implicated in the disease burden include population aging, urbanization, and poor diet quality and lifestyle habits. Diabetes related mortality on the other hand, is influenced by poor medication adherence and failure to attend scheduled clinic appointments. Such rapid expansion of the disease can be curtailed by adopting preventive strategies with regard to diet and lifestyle and with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Additionally, for the purpose of assessing treatment and care, evaluation of medication adherence and quality of life are crucial. Therefore, this review is a modest attempt to furnish an overview of the factors affecting medication adherence and quality of life and the different scales and questionnaires utilized for the evaluation of the two. Keywords: Diabetes mellitus, disease burden, medication adherence, quality of life. Full Text Article",
