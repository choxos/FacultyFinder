Patients received 5 mg or 10 mg of warfarin on day 1 and day 2; the day 2 dose was reduced only if an excess anticoagulant effect was seen on the INR determination performed 12 to 16 hours after the first warfarin dose was given. The third and subsequent warfarin doses were based on the INR response and were adjusted according to the appropriate algorithm. The mean warfarin doses administered in the 5-mg group were ...References1. Landefeld CS, Beyth RJ. Anticoagulant-related bleeding; clinical epidemiology, prediction, and prevention.
