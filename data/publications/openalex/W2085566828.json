  "title": "WATER QUALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF STORM WATER FROM MAJOR LAND USES IN SOUTH FLORIDA<sup>1</sup>",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Starting in 1998, a study was conducted to characterize storm water quality from predominant land use types in a coastal watershed along the south central coast of Florida, namely citrus, pasture, urban, natural wetland, row crop, dairy, and golf courses. Sixty‚Äêthree sampling sites were located at strategic points on drainage conveyances for each of seven specific land use areas. Runoff samples were collected following storm events that met defined rainfall criteria for a period of 30 months. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), heavy metals, pesticides, and other water quality parameters were determined, and the results were analyzed to compare and characterize land uses as relative sources for these constituents in runoff. Results showed that runoff from most land use types had low dissolved oxygen concentration and that sediment and nutrient concentrations were closely related to land use, particularly to the amount of fertilizer applied in each land use. Among the eight heavy metals tested, copper was the most frequently detected and was mostly associated with runoff from citrus and golf course land uses. High levels of arsenic were also detected in golf course runoff. The most frequently detected pesticide was simazine from citrus. The information and methodologies presented may facilitate pollution source characterization and ecological restoration efforts.",
