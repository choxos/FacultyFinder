  "abstract": "Title of dissertation: A TANNAKIAN DESCRIPTION FOR PARAHORIC BRUHAT-TITS GROUP SCHEMES Kevin Michael Wilson Jr., Doctor of Philosophy, 2010 Dissertation directed by: Professor Thomas Haines, Department of Mathematics Let K be a field which is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and let O be the ring of integers in K. We study the Bruhat-Tits building B(G) and the parahoric Bruhat-Tits group schemes GF associated to a connected reductive split linear algebraic group G defined over O. In order to study these objects we use the theory of Tannakian duality, developed by Saavedra Rivano, which shows how to recover G from its category of finite rank projective representations over O. We also use Moy-Prasad filtrations in order to define lattice chains in any such representation. Using these two tools, we give a Tannakian description to B(G). We also define a functor AutF associated to a facet F ⊂ B(G) in terms of lattice chains in a Tannakian way. We show that AutF is representable by an affine group scheme of finite type, has generic fiber GK , and satisfies AutF(OE) = GF(OE) for every unramified Galois extension E of K. Moreover, we show that there is a canonical morphism from GF to AutF, which we conjecture to be an isomorphism. We prove that it is an isomorphism when the residue characteristic of K is zero and G is arbitrary, when G = GLn and K is arbitrary, and when F is the minimal facet containing the origin and G and K are arbitrary.
