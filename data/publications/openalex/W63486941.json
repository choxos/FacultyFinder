  "abstract": "A Mask for MelibeaToward the close of the fifteenth century, two works on romantic love became very popular in Spain, although each treated the theme in a differ- ent way.Diego de San Pedro's Cárcel de Amor, published in 1492, inau- gurated the last decade of the century, and Fernando de Rojas's Comedia de Calisto y Melibea brought it to a close in 1499; but while San Pedro in- corporated into his work the medieval doctrines of chivalry and courtly love, Rojas, familiar with the Cárcel, satirized such notions and cast a very different light on love (Whinnom xxvii).'The situation presented in these two works is commonplace: fortune brings together two highborn loves; some unspecified impediment to their union causes suffering and death; and marriage is never discussed.However, the development by the two authors of this basic plot of impossible love illustrates two distinct world views.As each book opens, the young hero is already a prisoner of love, and his symptoms conform to the formula for courtly love: he is intellectually, emotionally and physically debilitated.The direction and outcome of courtship will differ for each swain, however, in keeping with his character, with externai forces, and especially with the behavior of his lady.A comparison of the two heroines offers considerable insight into the con- trary views of love presented by San Pedro and Rojas.When comparing and contrasting Laureola and Melibea, 1 shall consider their names, their class, their family, their suitors, their go-betweens, and finally their respec- tive courting behavior.The fact that Laureola is not named in the title while Melibea is suggests that whereas San Pedro writes about love.Rojas writes about a woman in love; and while Laureola is merely a fictional device, Melibea is a fic- tional character.The baptismal names of the two women are significam.\"Laureola\" indicates that this lady fulfills the courtly ideal: she wears a crown of victory {laureola), and she wears a crown of virtue {la aureola), a halo of light which corresponds to the light that filis Leriano's imagina- tion: \"La claridad grande ...",
