  "title": "1146-P: Feasibility of Home Capillary A1C Collection for Emerging Adults with T1D",
  "abstract": "Introduction and Objective: Home capillary A1C collection kits are an option for measuring A1C when laboratory collection is not feasible (e.g., virtual care or research). Obtaining A1C values near assessment is important, as A1C values can change over time. However, factors may influence A1C collection and turnaround time (elapsed time between mailing and collection) in virtual settings. The purpose of this analysis is to identify factors associated with home A1C collection completion and turnaround time in a sample of emerging adults (ages 18-30) with T1D from the baseline period of the Insurance, Health and Economic Resources Online (iHERO) study. Methods: ALDR (University of Minnesota Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory) A1C collection kits were mailed to 95 participants. A logistic regression and a linear regression of five sociodemographic factors (sex, race, student status, employment status, and distance from A1C laboratory) were performed to determine their associations with home A1C collection completion and with collection turnaround time, respectively. A Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied; alpha was set to .025. Results: Out of 104 collection kits mailed to 95 participants, 83 specimens (80%) were collected. Of the 83 specimens, 79 (95%) yielded usable A1C results. Average collection turnaround time was 14 ± 12 days. Average result turnaround time was 20 ± 12 days. The five sociodemographic factors neither significantly predicted A1C collection completion; χ²(5, N = 81) = 5.80, p =.33, nor collection turnaround time; F (5, 65) = 0.51, p =.765. Conclusion: Clinicians and behavioral researchers should plan 2-4 weeks to obtain home capillary A1C results for emerging adult populations. Non-targeted, broad strategies to promote collection feasibility include delivering collection kits near enrollment, sending automated alerts with goal A1C collection deadlines, following up by phone and email, and offering Zoom training. These strategies may reduce turnaround times, improving clinical utility and research rigor. Disclosure J. Rieke: None. C.S. Shannon: None. N.J. Rodgers: None. A.K. Kanchibhatla: None. D.A.
