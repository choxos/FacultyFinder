Prioritization criteria included awareness of significant new data and new controversies or questions about practice. Questions about topics no longer relevant to contemporary practice or where little new research has occurred were given lower priority. The ALS Task Force prioritized 42 PICO questions for review. With the assistance of information specialists, a detailed search for relevant articles was performed in each of 3 online databases (PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library).By using detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria, articles were screened for further evaluation. The reviewers for each question created a reconciled risk of bias assessment for each of the included studies, using state-of-the-art tools: Cochrane for randomized controlled trials (RCTs),4 Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS)-2 for studies of diagnostic accuracy,5 and GRADE for observational studies that inform both therapy and prognosis questions.6GRADE evidence profile tables7 were then created to facilitate an evaluation of the evidence in support of each of the critical and important outcomes. The quality of the evidence (or confidence in the estimate of the effect) was categorized as high, moderate, low, or very low,8 based on the study methodologies and the 5 core GRADE domains of risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision, and other considerations (including publication bias).9These evidence profile tables were then used to create a written summary of evidence for each outcome (the consensus on science statements). Whenever possible, consensus-based treatment recommendations were then created. These recommendations (designated as strong or weak) were accompanied by an overall assessment of the evidence and a statement from the task force about the values, preferences, and task force insights that underlie the recommendations. Further details of the methodology that underpinned the evidence evaluation process are found in \"Part 2: Evidence Evaluation and Management of Conflicts of Interest.\"The task force preselected and ranked outcome measures that were used as consistently as possible for all PICO questions. Longer-term, patient-centered outcomes were considered more important than process variables and shorter-term outcomes. For most questions, we used the following hierarchy starting with the most important: long-term survival with neurologically favorable survival, long-term survival, short-term survival, and process variable. In general, long-term was defined as from hospital discharge to 180 days or longer, and short-term was defined as shorter than to hospital discharge. For certain questions (eg, related to defibrillation or confirmation of tracheal tube position), process variables such as termination of fibrillation and correct tube placement were important. A few questions (eg, organ donation) required unique outcomes.The International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care Science With Treatment Recommendations (CoSTR) statements in this Part are organized in the approximate sequence of interventions for a patient: defibrillation, airway, oxygenation and ventilation, circulatory support, monitoring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), drugs during CPR, and special circumstances. We also include statements for postresuscitation care, prognostication of neurologic outcome, and organ donation.Defibrillation Strategies for Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) or Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia (pVT)Biphasic waveform (ALS 470)Pulsed biphasic waveform (ALS 470)First-shock energy (ALS 470)Single shock versus stacked shocks (ALS 470)Fixed versus escalating defibrillation energy levels (ALS 470)Recurrent VF (ALS 470)Airway, Oxygenation, and VentilationOxygen dose during CPR (ALS 889)Basic versus advanced airway (ALS 783)Supraglottic airways (SGAs) versus tracheal intubation (ALS 714)Confirmation of correct tracheal tube placement (ALS 469)Ventilation rate during continuous chest compressions (ALS 808)Circulatory Support During CPRImpedance threshold device (ITD) (ALS 579)Mechanical CPR devices (ALS 782)Extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) versus manual or mechanical CPR (ALS 723)Physiological Monitoring During CPREnd-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO2) to predict outcome of cardiac arrest (ALS 459)Monitoring physiological parameters during CPR (ALS 656)Ultrasound during CPR (ALS 658)Drugs During CPREpinephrine versus placebo (ALS 788)Epinephrine versus vasopressin (ALS 659)Epinephrine versus vasopressin in combination with epinephrine (ALS 789)Standard-dose epinephrine (SDE) versus high-dose epinephrine (HDE) (ALS 778)Timing of administration of epinephrine (ALS 784)Steroids for cardiac arrest (ALS 433)Antiarrhythmic drugs for cardiac arrest (ALS 428)Cardiac Arrest in Special CircumstancesCardiac arrest during pregnancy (ALS 436)Lipid therapy for cardiac arrest (ALS 834)Opioid toxicity (ALS 441)Cardiac arrest associated with pulmonary embolism (PE) (ALS 435)Cardiac arrest during coronary catheterization (ALS 479)Postresuscitation CareOxygen dose after return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in adults (ALS 448)Postresuscitation ventilation strategy (ALS 571)Postresuscitation hemodynamic support (ALS 570)Postresuscitation antiarrhythmic drugs (ALS 493)Targeted temperature management (ALS 790)Timing of induced hypothermia (ALS 802)Prevention of fever after cardiac arrest (ALS 879)Postresuscitation seizure prophylaxis (ALS 431)Seizure treatment (ALS 868)Glucose control after resuscitation (ALS 580)Prognostication in comatose patients treated with hypothermic targeted temperature management (TTM) (ALS 450)Prognostication in the absence of TTM (ALS 713)Organ donation (ALS 449)The 2010 CoSTR statements10,11 that have not been addressed in 2015 are listed under the relevant section.Summary of ALS Treatment RecommendationsThe systematic reviews showed that the quality of evidence for many ALS interventions is low or very low, and this led to predominantly weak recommendations. For some issues, despite a low quality of evidence, the values and preferences of the task force led to a strong recommendation. This was especially so when there was consensus that not doing so could lead to harm. In addition, treatment recommendations were left unchanged unless there were compelling reasons not to do so. The rationale for any change is addressed in the values, preferences, and insights that follow treatment recommendations. The most important developments and recommendations in ALS since the 2010 ILCOR review are as follows:Defibrillation strategies for VF or pVT:There were no major developments since 2010. We suggest if the first shock is not successful and the defibrillator is capable of delivering shocks of higher energy, it is reasonable to increase the energy for subsequent shocks.Airway, oxygenation, and ventilation:We suggest using the highest possible inspired oxygen concentration during CPR.There was equipoise between the choice of an advanced airway or a bag-mask device for airway management during CPR, and the choice between a SGA or tracheal tube as the initial advanced airway during CPR.The role of waveform capnography during ALS was emphasized, including its use to confirm and to continuously monitor the position of a tracheal tube during CPR.Circulatory support during CPR:We recommend against the routine use of the ITD in addition to conventional CPR but could not achieve consensus for or against the use of the ITD when used together with active compression-decompression (ACD) CPR.We suggest against the routine use of automated mechanical chest compression devices but suggest they are a reasonable alternative to use in situations where sustained high-quality manual chest compressions are impractical or compromise provider safety.We suggest ECPR is a reasonable rescue therapy for select patients with cardiac arrest when initial conventional CPR is failing in settings where this can be implemented.Physiological monitoring during CPR:Physiological measurement in addition to clinical signs and electrocardiographic monitoring has the potential to help guide interventions during ALS.We have not made a recommendation for any particular physiological measure to guide CPR, because the available evidence would make any estimate of effect speculative.We recommend against using ETCO2 cutoff values alone as a mortality predictor or for the decision to stop a resuscitation attempt.We suggest that if cardiac ultrasound can be performed without interfering with standard advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) protocol, it may be considered as an additional diagnostic tool to identify potentially reversible causes.Drugs during CPR:We suggest SDE (defined as 1 mg) be administered to patients in cardiac arrest after considering the observed benefit in short-term outcomes (ROSC and admission to hospital) and our uncertainty about the benefit or harm on survival to discharge and neurologic outcome. Our statement is not intended to change current practice until there are high-quality data on long-term outcomes.We suggest the use of amiodarone in adult patients with refractory VF/pVT to improve rates of ROSC. Our statement is not intended to change current practice until there are high-quality data on long-term outcomes.Cardiac arrest in special circumstances:The systematic review found very-low-quality evidence for specific interventions for ALS in the pregnant woman. We suggest delivery of the fetus by perimortem cesarean delivery for women in cardiac arrest in the second half of pregnancy.The lack of comparative studies led to the task force being unable to make any evidence-based treatment recommendation about the use of intravenous (IV) lipid emulsion to treat toxin-induced cardiac arrest.We recommend the use of naloxone by IV, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intraosseous (IO), or intranasal routes in respiratory arrest associated with opioid toxicity but make no recommendation regarding the modification of standard ALS in opioid-induced cardiac arrest.Postresuscitation care:We recommend avoiding hypoxia in adults with ROSC after cardiac arrest.We suggest avoiding hyperoxia in adults with ROSC after cardiac arrest.We suggest the use of 100% inspired oxygen until the arterial oxygen saturation or the partial pressure of arterial oxygen can be measured reliably in adults with ROSC after cardiac arrest.We suggest maintaining Paco2 within a normal physiological range as part of a post-ROSC bundle of care.We suggest hemodynamic goals (eg, mean arterial pressure [MAP], systolic blood pressure [SBP]) be considered during postresuscitation care and as part of any bundle of postresuscitation interventions.We recommend selecting and maintaining a constant target temperature between 32°C and 36°C for those patients in whom temperature control is used.We recommend TTM as opposed to no TTM for adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) with an initial shockable rhythm who remain unresponsive after ROSC.We suggest TTM as opposed to no TTM for adults with OHCA with an initial nonshockable rhythm who remain unresponsive after ROSC.We suggest TTM as opposed to no TTM for adults with in-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) with any initial rhythm who remain unresponsive after ROSC.We suggest that if TTM is used, duration should be at least 24 hours.We recommend against routine use of prehospital cooling with rapid infusion of large volumes of cold IV fluid immediately after ROSC.We suggest prevention and treatment of fever in persistently comatose adults after completion of TTM between 32°C and 36°C.We suggest against routine seizure prophylaxis in post–cardiac arrest patients.We recommend the treatment of seizures in post–cardiac arrest patients.We suggest no modification of standard glucose management protocols for adults with ROSC after cardiac arrest.Comatose patients treated with TTM:We suggest against the use of clinical criteria alone before 72 hours after ROSC to estimate prognosis.We suggest prolonging the observation of clinical signs when interference from residual sedation or paralysis is suspected, so that the possibility of incorrectly predicting poor outcome is minimized.We recommend that the earliest time to prognosticate a poor neurologic outcome is 72 hours after ROSC, and should be extended longer if the residual effect of sedation and/or paralysis confounds the clinical examination.We suggest that multiple modalities of testing (clinical exam, neurophysiological measures, imaging, or blood markers) be used to estimate prognosis instead of relying on single tests or findings.We recommend that all patients who have restoration of circulation after CPR and who subsequently progress to death be evaluated for organ donation.Defibrillation Strategies for VF or pVTThe task force restricted its review to new studies since the 2010 CoSTR12,13 and topics not reviewed in 2010. There are no major differences between the recommendations made in 2015 and those made in 2010. The PICO questions have been grouped into (1) waveforms, (2) first-shock energy, (3) single shock versus 3 shocks, (4) fixed versus escalating energy levels, and (5) refibrillation. In reviewing these, shock success is usually defined as termination of VF 5 seconds after the shock.Consensus on science and treatment recommendations for the use of automated external defibrillators can be found in \"Part 3: Adult Basic Life Support and Automated External Defibrillation,\" and for infants or children requiring defibrillation in \"Part 6: Pediatric Basic Life Support and Pediatric Advanced Life Support.\"Biphasic Waveform(ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy, such as biphasic waveform (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy), such as monophasic waveform (C), change survival with favorable neurologic/functional outcome at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; survival only at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; ROSC; termination of arrhythmia (O)?IntroductionAll newly manufactured defibrillators currently deliver shocks using biphasic waveforms. Although it has not been shown conclusively in randomized clinical studies that biphasic defibrillators save more lives than monophasic defibrillators, biphasic defibrillators achieve higher first-shock success rates at lower energy levels and appear to cause less postshock myocardial dysfunction.12,13Consensus on ScienceNo new randomized trials of biphasic waveforms since 2010 were identified.Treatment RecommendationWe recommend that a biphasic waveform (biphasic truncated exponential [BTE] or rectilinear-biphasic [RLB]) is used for both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias in preference to a monophasic waveform (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). In the absence of biphasic defibrillators, monophasic defibrillators are acceptable.Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making this strong recommendation, we place a high value on the reported higher first-shock success rate for termination of fibrillation with a biphasic waveform, the potential for less postshock myocardial dysfunction, and the existing 2010 CoSTR.12,13 The task force acknowledges that many emergency medical services (EMS) systems and hospitals around the world continue to use older monophasic devices.Pulsed Biphasic Waveform (ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy, such as pulsed biphasic waveform (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy) (C), change survival with favorable neurologic/functional outcome at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; survival only at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; ROSC; termination of arrhythmia (O)?IntroductionThe pulsed biphasic waveform that is used in clinical practice had not previously been reviewed in 2010. The single published study14 of this waveform used a non–impedance compensated waveform (ie, the current delivered is not adjusted for the impedance of the chest), whereas the waveform in clinical use is an impedance-compensated waveform (ie, the current delivered is adjusted for the impedance of the chest).Consensus on ScienceFor the critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge, very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for very serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 cohort study (ie, no control group)14 with a total of 104 patients that used a 130 J-130 J-180 J pulsed biphasic waveform protocol documented a survival rate of 9.8%. This compares with a weighted average BTE survival rate of 33.1% at 150 to 200 J.14For the important outcome of termination of fibrillation, the same very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for very serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 cohort study14 with a total of 104 patients documented first-shock termination rates at 130 J of 90.4% with a pulsed biphasic waveform, comparable with BTE waveforms (weighted average 91.8%) at 150 to 200 J.14Treatment RecommendationWe recommend following the manufacturer's instructions for first and subsequent shock energy levels for the pulsed biphasic waveform (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making this strong recommendation, we have placed a high value on following the manufacturer's guidance in the absence of high-quality data to suggest otherwise. The available very-low-quality data showing the efficacy of a non–impedance compensated pulsed biphasic waveform do not enable direct comparison with other biphasic waveforms. In addition, no clinical studies attest to the efficacy of this waveform in its current impedance-compensated form.First-Shock Energy (ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy, such as specific first-shock energy level (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy), such as a different first-shock energy level (C), change survival with favorable neurologic/functional outcome at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; survival only at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; ROSC; termination of arrhythmia (O)?IntroductionIn 2010, it was concluded that it was reasonable to start at a selected energy level of 150 to 200 J for a BTE waveform, and no lower than 120 J for an RLB waveform for defibrillation of VF/pVT cardiac arrest, acknowledging that the evidence was limited.12,13Consensus on ScienceFor the important outcome of termination of VF/pVT, low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and risk of bias, respectively) from a post hoc report from an RCT and a cohort study showed a first-shock success rate of 73 of 86 (85%) and 79 of 90 (87.8%), respectively, when using a 120 J initial shock with an RLB waveform.15,16Treatment RecommendationsWe recommend an initial biphasic shock energy of 150 J or greater for BTE waveforms, and 120 J or greater for RLB waveforms (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). If a monophasic defibrillator is used, we recommend an initial monophasic shock energy of 360 J (strong recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making these strong recommendations, the working group was keen to acknowledge manufacturer's instructions and recognize that evidence for the optimal first-shock energy level was lacking. We also considered that although monophasic defibrillators are no longer manufactured, they are still used in many countries.Single Shock Versus Stacked Shocks (ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy, such as a single shock (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy), such as 3 stacked shocks (C), change survival with favorable neurologic/functional outcome at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; survival only at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; ROSC; termination of arrhythmia (O)?IntroductionIn 2010, it was recommended that when defibrillation was required, a single shock should be provided with immediate resumption of chest compressions after the shock.12,13 This recommendation was made for 2 reasons: (1) in an attempt to minimize perishock interruptions to chest compressions, and (2) because it was thought that with the greater efficacy of biphasic shocks, if a biphasic shock failed to defibrillate, a further period of chest compressions could be beneficial. It was acknowledged that there was no clinical evidence to support improved outcomes from this strategy.Consensus on ScienceFor the critical outcome of survival to 1 year, we have identified low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 845 OHCA patients showing no difference in single versus 3 stacked shocks (odds ratio [OR], 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.53–5.06).17For the critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge, we have identified low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 845 OHCA patients showing no difference in single versus 3 stacked shocks (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.85–1.96).17For the critical outcome of survival to hospital admission, we have identified very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 845 OHCA patients showing no difference in single versus 3 stacked shocks (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.78–1.34).17For the critical outcome of ROSC, we have identified low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 845 OHCA patients showing no difference in single versus 3 stacked shocks (OR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72–1.23).17For the important outcome of recurrence of VF (refibrillation), we have identified low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias, serious indirectness, and serious imprecision) from 1 RCT enrolling 136 OHCA patients showing no difference in single versus 3 stacked shocks (OR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.47–2.13).18Treatment RecommendationWe recommend a single-shock strategy when defibrillation is required (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making this strong recommendation, the task force has placed a greater value on not changing current practice and minimizing interruptions in chest compressions whilst acknowledging that studies since 2010 have not shown that any specific shock strategy is of benefit for any survival end point. There is no conclusive evidence that a single-shock strategy is of benefit for ROSC or recurrence of VF compared with 3 stacked shocks, but in view of the evidence suggesting that outcome is improved by minimizing interruptions to chest compressions, we continue to recommend single shocks. The task force is aware that there are some circumstances (eg, witnessed, monitored VF cardiac arrest with defibrillator immediately available) when 3 rapid stacked shocks could be considered.Fixed Versus Escalating Defibrillation Energy Levels (ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy, such as fixed shock energy level (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy), such as escalating shock energy level (C), change survival with favorable neurologic/functional outcome at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; survival only at discharge, 30 days, 60 days, 180 days, and/or 1 year; ROSC; termination of arrhythmia (O)?IntroductionIn 2010, we recommended that for second and subsequent biphasic shocks, the same initial energy level was acceptable, but that it was reasonable to increase the energy level when possible (ie, with manual defibrillators).12,13Consensus on ScienceFor the critical outcome of survival with favorable neurologic outcome at hospital discharge, we identified very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias, serious imprecision, and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 221 OHCA patients showing no benefit of one strategy over the other (OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.34–1.78).19For the critical outcome of survival to hospital discharge, we have identified very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias, serious imprecision, and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 221 OHCA patients showing no benefit of one strategy over the other (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.52–2.16).19For the critical outcome of ROSC, we have identified very-low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias, serious imprecision, and serious indirectness) from 1 RCT enrolling 221 OHCA patients showing no benefit of one strategy over the other (OR, 1.095; 95% CI, 0.65–1.86).19Treatment RecommendationWe suggest if the first shock is not successful and the defibrillator is capable of delivering shocks of higher energy, it is reasonable to increase the energy for subsequent shocks (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence).Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making this recommendation, we have considered that an escalating shock energy may prevent the risk of refibrillation (see ALS 470). We also consider this to be in line with current practices where rescuers will escalate shock energy if initial defibrillation attempts fail and the defibrillator is capable of delivering a higher shock energy.Recurrent VF (Refibrillation) (ALS 470)Among adults who are in VF or pVT in any setting (P), does any specific defibrillation strategy (I), compared with standard management (or other defibrillation strategy) (C), improve termination of refibrillation (O)?IntroductionRefibrillation is common and occurs in the majority of patients after initial first-shock termination of VF.20 Refibrillation was not specifically addressed in 2010 guidelines. Distinct from refractory VF, defined as fibrillation that persists after 1 or more shocks, recurrence of fibrillation is usually defined as recurrence of VF during a documented cardiac arrest, occurring after initial termination of VF while the patient remains under the care of the same providers (usually out-of-hospital).Consensus on ScienceFor the important outcome of termination of refibrillation, low-quality evidence (downgraded for serious risk of bias) from 2 observational studies16,21 with a total of 191 cases of initial fibrillation showed termination rates of subsequent refibrillation were unchanged when using fixed 120 or 150 J shocks, respectively, and another observational study20 (downgraded for confounding factors) with a total of 467 cases of initial fibrillation showed termination rates of refibrillation declined when using repeated 200 J shocks, unless an increased energy level (360 J) was selected.Treatment RecommendationWe suggest an escalating defibrillation energy protocol to prevent refibrillation (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).Values, Preferences, and Task Force InsightsIn making this weak recommendation, we considered the lack of studies showing myocardial injury from biphasic waveforms, making it reasonable to consider increasing defibrillation energy levels when delivering shocks for refibrillation if the energy dose delivered by the defibrillator can be increased. It is unclear from current studies whether repeated episodes of VF are more resistant to defibrillation and require a higher energy level or whether a fixed energy level is adequate.Defibrillation Knowledge GapsConsidering that defibrillation is one of the few inter",
