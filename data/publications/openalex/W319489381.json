  "abstract": "This article examines the implications of computerized scoring of placement essays for the theory and practice of writing assessment, particularly for the complexly interrelated issues of economics, universality, and validity; and then considers its broader implications for the theory and practice of writing instruction. It argues that the very feature that would make computerized scor ing inexpensive-its generalizability for widespread use-undermines its valid ity. The ultimate criterion for measuring the validity of any placement instru ment is whether the instrument matches the specific local conditions, in this case, the purposes and content of the courses in which the students begin writing instruction. A generalized scoring system by definition cannot meet that criterion. More importantly, a computerized scoring system undermines the hard won though still insecure recognition that writing is a communicative act in separable from audiences, purposes, and contexts.If, as Emil Roy suggested in his article \"Computerized Scor ing Placement Exams: A Validation\" (Journal of Basic Writing, Fall 1993), computer programs can accurately and inexpen sively assess samples of student writing for placement pur poses, it appears that computer technology might reform holis tic scoring, frequently criticized and often rejected for being too costly and too subjective.Terming the computer a \"new and authoritative tool,\" Roy seeks to appropriate its efficiency to Kathryn R. Fitzgerald coordinates the placement program for the University of Utah's Writing Program. She is also past coordinator of Utah's basic writing program and currently coordinates standard freshman writing.",
