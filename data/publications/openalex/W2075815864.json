Materials and Methods: Since May 1992, 112 male and 18 female patients with neurogenic bladder have undergone augmentation cystoplasty with a generous detubularized segment of bowel and no effort to correct existing reflux. Patients were treated conservatively at the beginning but the response was unsatisfactory. All patients had various degrees of vesicoureteral reflux (197 refluxing units). Mean age at operation was 21.6 years (range 1.5 to 57). Preoperatively assessment included urinalysis, urine culture, kidney function tests, voiding cystourethrography, urodynamic evaluation, ultrasonography or excretory urography and cystoscopy when indicated. The status of vesicoureteral reflux, renal hydronephrosis and clinical pyelonephritis were studied during an average followup of 44.5 months. Results: Of the 130 patients 111 (85.4%) no longer had reflux, 14 (10.8%) had improvement, 4 (3%) had no change and 1 (0.8%) had worsening reflux. All refluxing units with grades I to III, 105 of 120 with grade IV (87.5%) and 8 of 13 with grade V (61.5%) showed complete cessation of reflux. Renal hydronephrosis improved in 127 renal units (97.7%). In 8 individuals (6.2%) without reflux after cystoplasty episodes of clinical pyelonephritis occurred. Conclusions: Augmentation cystoplasty without ureteral reimplantation is effective and adequate treatment for high pressure, noncompliant neurogenic bladder when conservative management fails.
