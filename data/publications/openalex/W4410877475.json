  "abstract": "Physical Education (PE) and Sports are means of educating, training and nurturing the young generation for a comprehensive future development.

Especially improving the ability to think tactically helps athletes to improve their ability to analyze - evaluate, and plan the game.

This skill helps learners to improve their ability to coordinate between pieces on the board towards solving clear tasks such as checkmate, draw, and capture.&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Article visualizations:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"/-counters-/soc/0425/a.php\" alt=\"Hit counter\" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",
