  "title": "LYNDA MUGGLESTONE, Lost for Words: the Hidden History of the Oxford English Dictionary. Pp. xxv+273. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 2005. 19.95 (ISBN 0 300 10699 8).",
  "abstract": "THE history of the making of The Oxford English Dictionary, like the dictionary itself, is an immense subject inviting a multitude of perspectives and approaches. In Lost for Words, Lynda Mugglestone has, through original archival research, skilfully exposed the processes by which the first edition of OED (originally titled A New English Dictionary on Historical Principles) was generated. One feature of Mugglestone's book that may invite a broader readership than it would otherwise have received is its inclusion of a quite readable history of the writing of OED, from its initial conception by Richard Trench and the Philological Society to the many events and circumstances – including inefficient editors, financial difficulties, personal squabbles, and national calamities, some of which threatened to shut the project down altogether – to its triumphant completion in 1928. This important contextual work, though not new territory per se, is necessary to Mugglestone's main argument because it shows the external pressures that Murray and his colleagues faced, in particular the repeated demand by the delegates of the press to pare down each fascicle of the dictionary, a pressure which influenced many of the decisions discussed throughout the book.",
