  "title": "Slower than the eye can see: Environmental change in North Australia's cattlelands",
  "abstract": "Slower than the Eye Can See deals with the environmental history of the Victoria River District, located in the far northwest of the NorthernTerritory.The region is vast, roughly 50,000 square miles in the old measure (130,000 square kilometres): a mosaic of flat-topped sandstone and limestone ranges, rounded basalt hills, and red and black soil plains. It extends from the high rainfall coastal fringe to the arid inland sand plains and consequently has a wide variety of floristic communities: savannas, Mitchell grass plains, rainforest patches, spinifex-covered hills and scrublands.The region was one of the last areas of Australia to be occupied by Europeans, the first settlers arriving in 1883. It was a cattleman’s paradise of wide Mitchell grass plains, abundantly watered with large waterholes in the major rivers and creeks, numerous springs and generally reliable monsoon rains. It began as cattle country, the home of huge and legendary stations—Wave Hill, Victoria River Downs, Ord River—and although there have been some significant changes in land tenure over the past twenty years, it remains predominantly cattle country today.",
