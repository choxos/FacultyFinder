  "title": "A study of the growth sector boundary between the -<i>X</i>and<i>Z</i>sectors in synthetic quartz II. Fringe contrast",
  "abstract": "Abstract The stacking-fault type fringe contrast seen on projection X-ray topographs of growth sector boundaries has been studied at the boundary between the -X and Z growth sectors in synthetic quartz. The lattice deformation near this boundary has been examined theoretically on the basis of a previously proposed model (Parpia 1976). In the specimen plate considered, the boundary was inclined at a shallow angle to the major surfaces of the crystal, and perpendicular to one pair of minor surfaces. The longer side of these minor surfaces is defined as the length of the specimen. It was found that a small tilt about an axis parallel to the length of the specimen could exist near the boundary between the two regions. A theoretical analysis of the dynamic X-ray wavefield trajectories was developed by which the difference in X-ray diffraction conditions between the two growth sectors in the specimen considered could be evaluated from X-ray ‘section patterns’. Using a specimen resembling that considered theoretically, ‘section patterns’ were obtained, and it was found that a tilt of ∼5·3 × 10 −6 radians existed between the two growth sectors.",
