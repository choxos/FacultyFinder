A cryptic version of this cohesion lodged in Collins's Preface echoes the imperialist project's vigilance against the naive hindsight that would pit the rapacious foreign exploiter cast as self against the innocent exploited other. In fact, as in the impeachment of Warren Hastings, the architects of empire openly dismantled such oppositions when the need arose. The political discourse of empire needed to emblazon itself with imaginative justifications under the cultural rubric of reason. And that implied the willing or unwilling",
