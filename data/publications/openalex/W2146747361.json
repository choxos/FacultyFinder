  "title": "Smooth Muscle Symposium",
  "abstract": "The 1991 CFBS Smooth Muscle Symposium, supported by Ciba-Geigy Canada, provided an opportunity to recognize Professor Edwin E. Danid's contribution to smooth muscle research. In a career spanning approximately forty years, Dr. Daniel's contributions are recognized worldwide and the CFBS symposium brought together some of Dr. Daniel's farmer graduate students and present colleagues and collaborators from North America. Dr. Daniel began h e symposium by providing a retrospective overview of Row, in his laboratory, smooth muscle research had developed. He highlighted the many contributions of those who had worked with him. Dr. Robert Garfield (McMaster University, and now Gdveston, Texas) followed with a review sf his own studies of the structure md function of gap junctions in smooth muscle. Dr. Nicholas Spereldcis (Cincinnati) then presented his findings concerning fast Na+ channels in uterine smooth muscle function. Dr. C. C. Y. (David) Kwan (McMaster) reviewed the development and use of subcellular membrane techniques for studies of smooth muscle function. The next speaker, Dr. Casey van Breemen of Miami, reviewed his recent studies of the regdation of @a2+ in vascular smooth muscle and stressed the impmnce of the superficial intracellular Ca2+ pool. The find speaker was Dr. Newman Stephens of Manitoba, who focussed on his studies relating the biochemistry and biophysics of smooth muscle to function. The symposium was cs-chaired by Dr. Michael W. Wolowyk of Edmonton and Dr. Christopher R. Triggle of Calgary. Both were graduate students in Edmonton when Dr. Daniel was chairman of the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Alberta. Dr. Wolowyk was one of Dr, Daniel's first PkD. students.",
