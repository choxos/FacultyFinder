  "title": "Home-Based HIV Counseling and Testing as a Gateway to Earlier Initiation of Antiretroviral Therapy",
  "abstract": "Timely access to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) represents the single most effective intervention in reducing mortality and morbidity among patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or AIDS. Until recently, the threshold for initiating ART in resource-limited settings was set at a CD4 T-cell count #200 cells/mm, a conservative threshold that had been abandoned in wealthier settings several years earlier [1]. Randomized trial data [2] and cohort evaluations [3] that demonstrate improved survival when ART is initiated earlier provided convincing evidence for the World Health Organization to revise guidance for resource-limited settings to initiate ART at a CD4 T-cell count #350 cells/mm. Most developing countries have now adopted or strive for this target threshold. More recent studies have validated this shift by demonstrating the broader benefits of earlier initiation of ART, including reduced incidence of tuberculosis [4], reduced rates of hospitalization [5], reduced likelihood of HIV transmission [6], and increased life expectancy [7]. Changing the threshold for initiation was seen as a daunting task, and a common refrain in discussions about early ART initiation in resource-limited settings was that raising the threshold would overwhelm healthcare systems by increasing the number of new patients requiring a clinician’s time [8]. It has often been pointed out that most patients in sub-Saharan Africa present too late as it is, with an average CD4 T cell count of only 111 cells/mm [9]. For the most part, however, the reasons that patients present late to care have nothing to do with initiation thresholds at the clinic. Rather, they are related to a lack of awareness of their HIV status [10] or disincentives to accessing care, such as high costs [11] or distances from clinics [12]. There is no convincing evidence that individuals arrive late to care because they have been ‘‘crowded out’’ by patients who are not as sick. Earlier treatment means that patients do not become as sick and thus need less-complex care. Evidence from programs to date suggests that earlier initiation supports access to care by promoting delivery of ART by nurse-led primary care clinics and reducing demands for more-specialized and inpatient clinical care [5]. Although considerable research attention has been paid to demonstrating the relative merits of earlier ART initiation, the question of how to encourage persons to seek treatment earlier has to date been almost entirely neglected. Recently, the need for better retention in care between testing and initiation of treatment for eligible patients has been recognized [13]. An important prior concern is to identify patients as early as possible, both to decrease the likelihood of transmission between partners and to provide an early opportunity to engage patients into care. Home-based counseling and testing (HBCT) represent an important strategy for identifying patients before their CD4 T cells are severely depleted. It is also a strategy to engage underrepresented populations in HIV/AIDS testing. Populations such as men, the elderly, and adolescents [14, 15] are regularly excluded from testing campaigns and are thus underrepresented in ART treatment programs, leading to worse overall mortality for these groups [16]. Designers of targeted HBCT that aim to broadly involve either the entire population in a setting or an accurate sample of it need to consider whether these groups are likely to be identified through HBCT or more likely to be located outside the home [17]. The study by Wachira and colleagues provides compelling evidence that widespread HIV counseling HBCT helps identify Received 21 September 2011; accepted 26 September 2011. Correspondence: Edward J.
