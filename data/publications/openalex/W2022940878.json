  "title": "Variation of Morphology, Yield and Essential Oil Components in Common Chamomile (Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rauschert) Cultivars Grown in Southern Italy",
  "abstract": "SURMMARY The common chamomile (Chamomilla recutita (L.) Rauschert) is one of the oldest and most popular medicinal plants, used for its numerous properties. Two diploid and two tetraploid cultivars, sown and transplanted in Southern Italy, were compared to determine the variation in morphology, yield and essential oil components at two harvest times. An analysis of variance was performed, and means were compared using Duncan's test. The greatest height, maximum number of flowers per flower head, and number of main stems of the plants were obtained with transplanted plants. The larger diameter and highest weight of flowers were obtained from tetraploid cultivars. The greater fresh and dry flower head yields were obtained from diploid cultivars. There were no statistical differences on oil percentage among the four cultivars and between the harvest times. The chemical type classification was determined, as suggested by Schilcher.",
