  "title": "Behind the Veil: Antonio Enríquez Gómez, Kabbalah, and the Immaculate Conception",
  "abstract": "Antonio Enríquez Gómez, a Spanish expatriot living in the Iberian merchant enclaves of France, was wanted by the Inquisition as a relapsed converso. Though he spent more than a decade in exile (c. 1636-1649) as a practicing Jew, he returned to Spain (Sevilla) clandestinely and wrote comedias de santos for the theater under the name of Fernando de Zárate. This study explores how the playwright’s exposure to Judaism abroad may have inflected his composition of La escala de la gracia, an Immaculate Conception play from the 1650s. In particular, I consider Lurianic Kabbalah, which had permeated Jewish spirituality in the seventeenth century, as an interpretive strategy that the poet may have utilized to encode, behind the veil of allegory, one message for Christian audiences and another for crypto-Jewish readers. The poet, himself an adept at crossing the boundary between worldviews, creates a work that transcends this world (the mundane) and unites it with the next (the sacred).",
