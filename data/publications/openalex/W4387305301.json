  "title": "Efficacy of Bhramari pranayama and Om chanting on asthma control, quality of life, and airway inflammation in asthmatic children: an open-label randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "AbstractObjectives To explore the efficacy of combination of Bhramari pranayama and om chanting as an adjunct to standard pharmacological treatment on asthma control, quality of life, pulmonary function, and airway inflammation in asthmatic children.Methods Children (n = 110; 8–15 years) with uncontrolled or partly controlled asthma were recruited from the Pediatric Chest Clinic of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. Eligible participants were randomized to either home-based online Bhramari pranayama and om chanting plus standard treatment (YI + ST) group, or standard treatment (ST) alone group. Primary outcome measures were 12-week change in level of asthma symptom control; asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score, spirometry indices, impulse oscillometry parameters, and pediatric asthma quality of life questionnaire (PAQLQ) score. Secondary outcome was a change in fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels at 12 weeks. Beginning from the enrollment, every participant was evaluated at 0, 2, 6, and 12 weeks.Results After 12 weeks of intervention, higher proportion (68.2%) of children were found to have controlled asthma symptoms in the YI + ST group as compared to ST group (38.5%) according to per protocol analysis (p = 0.03). When compared to ST group, children in YI + ST group showed significantly lower ACQ score, higher PAQLQ score and reduced FeNO levels. No significant changes were observed for the lung function parameters.Conclusion Children practicing Bhramari pranayama and om chanting for 12 weeks have better asthma symptom control, quality of life, and reduced airway inflammation than those taking standard pharmacotherapy alone.Keywords: AsthmaBhramari pranayamaom chantingpulmonary functionchildren AcknowledgmentsThis study is funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research, New Delhi.
