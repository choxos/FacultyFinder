  "abstract": "The ambitious aim of ‘gathering together in one place the most important primarydocuments’ on the battle of Crecy has produced this welcome collection, consistinglargely of chronicle accounts as very few administrative records are included. Thecontrast with George Wrottesley’s Crecy and Calais (London, 1898) is striking, for hegathered a huge number of writs and other documents to demonstrate how theEnglish army was recruited, and to identify many of those who took part in thecampaign. This volume is not concerned with such matters, though they do much toexplain the English success. Instead, the sources, impressive in number, located bythe editors show the widespread interest of chroniclers across Europe in the battle,and the difficulty that they faced in describing it. Admirably, the sources are providedboth in the original language and in translation. The texts are accompanied by half adozen explanatory essays.",
