  "title": "Introduction: Territory, Politics, and Performance in Tudor Britain",
  "abstract": "Of all the old and important words we use to think about human history and the events and chronicles that constitute our past, perhaps ‘territory’ is among the most significant and evocative. Derived from the Latin terra (meaning ‘earth’), it defines the places where we walk around, build our homes, and lay the dead to rest. Our territories tell us where borders and jurisdictions exist – they separate and connect. As a starting point, knowing more about the word’s origins is useful, because they seem inherently related to the processes of civilization that govern and define modern societies. According to David Storey, ‘in the Roman era, the word territorium was associated with both community and territory’, whereby ‘the idea of owing allegiance to the territory began to supersede allegiance to a lord, or a God’.1 Territory’s history is, however, more complex than it seems; it bears witness to the spatial dimensions of power structures, and how they have changed over time. As a scholarly concept, though, territory has received surprisingly meagre theorization – we are only beginning to understand its complex intersections with ideas of space, mobilities, and the (geo- and bio-) politics of specific places. For the political theorist and geographer Stuart Elden, political theory still ‘lacks a sense of territory’ and ‘territory lacks a political theory’.2 More complex than a simple bordered-and-therefore-controlled space, territory is an instrument of change and control in and of itself; it is ‘a requirement and tool of power’. Elden terms it an ‘extension of the state’s power’: ‘a bundle of political technologies’, which ‘comprises techniques for measuring land and controlling terrain’.3 Territory is one of the state’s primary languages of power, and in 2019’s political contexts – in Britain and elsewhere – we can hear its words spoken loudly and often. To understand more about territory today, we need to learn what we can about the contexts of its development over time; and part of that process demands the deconstruction of stories, myths, and broader textual expressions that relate to these themes and ideas.",
