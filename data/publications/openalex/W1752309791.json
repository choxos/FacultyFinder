  "title": "A Property-Owning Democracy?: Home Ownership and the Working Class in Canada",
  "abstract": "THERE ARE FEW ASPECTS of urban studies whose interpretation is so hotly disputed as the relationship between home ownership and the working class.A heated debate has raged among social scientists for over a decade now, focusing on the extent to which the rise in home ownership in North America, Britain, Australia and New Zealand can be explained as the result of the orchestration of capitalists and the state. 1 Deep-seated arguments among the major theoretical paradigms centre not only on the interpretation of historical trends, future developments and policy prescriptions, but on the very concepts of tenure and class utilized to assess housing, reflecting larger debates on the cogency of traditional political economic analysis.Is social class the most useful explanatory concept for understanding high levels of working-class owner occupation?What role has ideology and culture played in the expressed preference for owning one's own home?How does the house production and finance sectors, and the state figure in these developments?Michael Doucet and John Weaver tackle these questions in their wide-ranging book.Explicitly conceived as a rebuttal to influential studies by left-wing and feminist scholars, this ambitious examination regards home ownership by the masses as the result of a deeply-ingrained \"will to possess\" which has contributed to the fundamental \"democratization\" of shelter in capitalism.Drawing on an impressive array of quantitative and qualitative sources and applying innovative research strategies to uncover the complexities of shelter provision, Doucet and Weaver dismiss arguments about the housing sphere and home ownership in 'For a brief review of the debate see Richard Harris and GÃ©raldine Pratt, \"Housing Tenure and Social Class:",
