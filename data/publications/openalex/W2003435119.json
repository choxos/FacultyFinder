  "title": "Biodata phenomenology: Recruiters' perceptions and use of biographical information in resume screening.",
  "abstract": "Recruiters' phenomenological perceptions of biodata in resumes were examined along with their use of biodata for making applicant screening decisions. The thesis was that biodata were interpreted as indicating abilities and other attributes. Three complementary studies were conducted with 344 recruiters from 28 companies. Study 1 survey results indicated recruiters judged biodata to reflect both ability (language, math, physical) and other (interpersonal, leadership, motivation) attributes. Both types of attributes were judged with high interrecruiter reliability, and attributes judged to be reflected depended partly on the job considered. Study 2 experimental results indicated that recruiters rated resumes more attractive to the degree that biodata in the resumes reflected attributes required by the jobs. Study 3 protocol analysis results confirmed that recruiters considered these attributes with substantial frequency",
