The key question we ask ourselves in selecting studies to include in EBMH is will mental health clinicians be able to use the findings of this study in their practice? We do not believe that the results of analogue studies are useful in clinical practice, and in this note we outline our reasoning. By analogue studies, we are referring to studies in which the therapeutic setting is in some senses an “analogue” of routine clinical practice or the participants (usually students) are different from those to whom the treatment or scale will ultimately be applied.\n\nThere are various issues that determine how useful a study can be to practitioners, some of which are shared by research in other areas of health care. Thus, for example, all studies should be designed in a way that gives readers confidence in their findings. This is why EBMH and the other evidence-based journals have explicit methodological criteria for …",
