  "title": "The Case for Jury Sentencing",
  "abstract": "There are powerful historical, constitutional, empirical, and policy justifications for a return to the practice of having juries, not judges, impose sentences in criminal cases. The fact that Americans inherited from the English a mild preference for judge sentencing was more a historical accident than a case of thoughtful policy. Jury sentencing became quite widespread in the colonial and postcolonial eras as a reflection of deepseated mistrust of the judiciary. The gradual drift away from jury sentencing was driven not by a new-found faith in the judiciary, but rather by the now discredited paradigm of rehabilitationism. Now that that paradigm has shifted to neoretribution, and that the essential moral character of the criminal law has been rediscovered, jurors should likewise be rediscovered as the best arbiters of that moral inquiry. A return to jury sentencing would also mesh nicely with the Court’s struggle in its Apprendi line of cases to find a sensible way to distinguish between elements and sentence-enhancers under the Sixth Amendment. A Sixth Amendment interpreted to include the right to jury sentencing would also restore the textual symmetry between the Sixth and Seventh Amendments. There are no constitutional, empirical, or policy reasons why a defendant accused of committing negligence has the right to have both his guilt and damages assessed by a jury, but a criminal defendant has only half that right.

The views expressed here are of course my own, and do not necessarily reflect the views of the District Court for the Second Judicial District or any of my colleagues on that court. I want to thank Adriaan Lanni, whose Note in the Yale Law Journal in 1999 was the first article in eighty-one years to call for a return to jury sentencing. I have borrowed liberally from that Note, especially in discussing the empirical case. I also want to thank my law clerk, Steven Wienczkowski, and my intern, Jane Grinney, for their research and editorial help. 073003 HOFFMAN.DOC 09/03/03 4:55 PM 952 DUKE LAW JOURNAL [Vol. 52:951",
