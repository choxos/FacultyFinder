  "title": "Natural forests in New Zealand – a large terrestrial carbon pool in a national state of equilibrium",
  "abstract": "Abstract Background Natural forests cover approximately 29% of New Zealand’s landmass and represent a large terrestrial carbon pool. In 2002 New Zealand implemented its first representative plot-based natural forest inventory to assess carbon stocks and stock changes in these mostly undisturbed old-growth forests. Although previous studies have provided estimates of biomass or carbon stocks, these were either not fully representative or lacked data from important pools such as dead wood (coarse woody debris). The current analysis provides the most complete estimates of carbon stocks and stock changes in natural forests in New Zealand. Results We present estimates of per hectare carbon stocks and stock changes in live and dead organic matter pools excluding soil carbon based on the first two measurement cycles of the New Zealand Natural Forest Inventory carried out from 2002 to 2014. These show that New Zealand’s natural forests are in balance and are neither a carbon source nor a carbon sink. The average total carbon stock was 227.0 ± 14.4 tC·ha − 1 (95% C.I.) and did not change significantly in the 7.7 years between measurements with the net annual change estimated to be 0.03 ± 0.18 tC·ha − 1 ·yr − 1 . There was a wide variation in carbon stocks between forest groups. Regenerating forest had an averaged carbon stock of only 53.6 ± 9.4 tC·ha − 1 but had a significant sequestration rate of 0.63 ± 0.25 tC·ha − 1 ·yr − 1 , while tall forest had an average carbon stock of 252.4 ± 15.5 tC·ha − 1 , but its sequestration rate did not differ significantly from zero (− 0.06 ± 0.20 tC·ha − 1 ·yr − 1 ). The forest alliance with the largest average carbon stock in above and below ground live and dead organic matter pools was silver beech-red beech-kamahi forest carrying 360.5 ± 34.6 tC·ha − 1 . Dead wood and litter comprised 27% of the total carbon stock. Conclusions New Zealand’s Natural Forest Inventory provides estimates of carbon stocks including estimates for difficult to measure pools such as dead wood and roots. It also provides estimates of uncertainties including effects of model prediction error and sampling variation between plots. Importantly it shows that on a national level New Zealand’s natural forests are in balance. Nevertheless, this is a nationally important carbon pool that requires continuous monitoring to identify potential negative or positive changes.",
