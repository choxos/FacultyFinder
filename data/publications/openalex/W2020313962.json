  "title": "LETTER FROM THE EDITOR",
  "abstract": "FigureA new ACG journal is born. I am very pleased to announce the launch of the ACG Case Reports Journal. At ACG, we acknowledge the unmet need for a journal easily accessible to GI fellows and new gastroenterologists who are eager to contribute to the expanding field of GI literature. To fill that need, we created the ACG Case Reports Journal, the first GI journal to be fully edited by GI fellows and open primarily to authors still in their GI training. Our editorial board consists of a group of brilliant GI fellows who are fully committed to the success of this venture and to preparing themselves for potential future leadership positions in similar fields. It is with great pleasure that we launch this first issue of the Journal after several months of effort by the Editorial Board, editorial office staff, our peer reviewers, and the ACG Publications Committee. I would like to thank all involved, especially our reviewers, who have enthusiastically volunteered to help despite their busy training schedules. This first issue would not have been possible without your fascinating and high-quality case submissions. We are proud that our initial announcement was extremely well received among GI trainees and others in the field. We received an impressive number of submissions, and currently have an outstanding acceptance rate of approximately 20%. I invite all interested GI fellows to consider submitting an interesting case report or image to the ACG Case Reports Journal or to sign up as a peer reviewer. Please explore our website (acgcasereports.gi.org) for more information on how to get involved. I hope you enjoy reading our very first issue, and I welcome your thoughts.
