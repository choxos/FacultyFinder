  "abstract": "This study explores the relationship between primary school physical education and physical activity as sites for the practice of physical activity of Irish primary school children. Understanding how children make connections between physical activity sites is important in shaping physical education experiences that promote lifelong participation. Children’s (aged 8–11) awareness, knowledge, and understanding of physical activity and physical education were examined using participatory methods of ‘draw and write’ ( n = 135) and focus group interviews ( n = 34). In Phase 1, data collection focused on physical activity, while Phase 2 focused on physical education and connections between physical activity and physical education. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Data analysis resulted in four themes: gendered patterns of participation; connections between physical education and physical activity; the nature and choice of participation in activities; and perceptions of ability. Children had varying understandings of the connections between their participation in physical education and physical activity. These findings highlight the importance of supporting all children to make explicit connections between their learning in physical education and their wider physical activity participation. An implication of the findings is that children need to be explicitly prompted to engage in physical activity. Without such encouragement, children are unlikely to draw linkages between physical activity and physical education.",
