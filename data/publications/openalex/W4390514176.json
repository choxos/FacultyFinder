  "title": "Mathematics Educators Perception On Ways Of Resolving Human Development Issues In Nigeria Through Mathematics",
  "abstract": "This study investigated ways of resolving human development issues in Nigeria through Mathematics. The study adopted a descriptive survey research design. The population of the study consisted of 724 Mathematics educators from the Education Zones in Cross River State. A sample of 258 respondents was drawn using a convenient non-probability sampling technique by applying Yamane’s formula. Three research questions were raised to guide the study. A structured questionnaire of 15 items was used to collect data on ways of resolving human development issues in Nigeria through Mathematics. The instrument was validated by three experts; two of them were Mathematics experts while the other was from Tests and Measurement unit of the department of Educational Foundations, all in University of Calabar. The reliability of the instrument was calculated using Cronbach Alpha. The questionnaire had a reliability coefficient 77 data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation. Among the findings were that Mathematics can be applied in resolving human development issues in Nigeria through helping an individual to forecast for the future, carry out research on resolving human development issues and to take decision. It was recommended among others that: there should be effective and functional mathematics education at all levels in order to transform skills realized for mathematics to solve the nation’s security challenges; Since mathematics enhances the level of human reasoning and further develop the mind, technical and generic courses undertaken by staff in any industry should continuously incorporate some level of mathematics in their training curricula. This will further develop the minds of our present and future leaders for better decision making and be more scientific in general management and public administration; Mathematics educators should be involved in all government programmes for resolving human development issues.&#x0D; &#x0D;",
