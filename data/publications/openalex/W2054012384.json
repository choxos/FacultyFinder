  "title": "Paper Mill Sludge Composting and Compost Utilization",
  "abstract": "Economically viable and environmentally acceptable methods to recycle organic wastes are needed by the pulp and paper industry. We assessed the potential for composting the Virginia Fibre Corporation's (VFC) combined primary and secondary dewatered paper mill sludge (PMS) and evaluated the suitability of the finished product as a potting soil substitute. Composting treatments were: 1) PMS with no supplemental N (control), 2) PMS + 15 kg N/Mg PMS (dry weight), and 3) PMS + 30 kg N/Mg PMS (dry weight). Composting was conducted for 129 days and treatment effects were evaluated by windrow temperature trends. A container plant growth study employing various particle size fractions and proportions of the control PMS compost and a commercial potting medium (Promixtm) was conducted in a greenhouse to assess the capability of the compost to support growth of radish (Raphanus sativus L.), snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), marigold (Tagetes erecta L.), and green pepper (Capsicum sp.). Windrow temperatures were lower with no supplemental N than with the N additions during the initial three weeks and were higher with increasing N rate during the last month of composting, which indicated that the unamended sludge may have been N-limited for maximum biological activity. Reduced temperatures in the high N treatments during the midpoint of the composting process may have been induced by ammonia toxicity. However, cured compost chemical properties and stability were not influenced by treatment and were indicative of good quality compost. The lower amount of plant-available water and greater amounts of plant-available nutrients supplied by the compost than the commercial potting medium resulted in less dry matter produced by all plants except green pepper, whose higher nutrient needs were supplied better by the compost than the commercial potting medium alone. Therefore, the paper mill sludge compost may best be used as an organic fertilizer, soil amendment, or supplemental nutrient source for potting media, rather than as a potting medium alone.",
