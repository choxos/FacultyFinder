  "abstract": "Six Principles of Self-Regulated Learning: Developing Self-Regulated Language Learners Andrea M. Gonzalez Department of Linguistics and English Language, BYU Master of Arts Self-regulation is an important aspect of learning, and all teachers want to instill this ability in their students. However, students often feel confused or inadequate when it comes to being in charge of their own learning. This is especially true in intensive English programs where students expect the teacher to provide them with the information they need to pass tests and advance to higher levels. While the teacher’s role cannot be overlooked, encouraging selfregulated learning is also vital to students’ success in learning. The author saw a need for this in the intensive English program where she is teaching. She created a workbook which outlines the six principles of self-regulated learning as presented by Andrade and Evans (2013). During the course of two semesters, she gathered data from teachers and students in classes at the English Language Center (ELC) through surveys and interviews regarding how useful the workbook was in helping students to be more self-regulated in their learning. The feedback indicates that the principles presented in the workbook were useful, and the students felt better equipped to face future learning. Although this was a preliminary study, the feedback collected regarding the workbook indicates that students are more receptive to self-regulated learning if they have the tools to understand how to be self-regulated learners. A second study was conducted by administrators of an intensive English program, and the results demonstrated the workbook was useful for their purposes in many different proficiency levels.",
