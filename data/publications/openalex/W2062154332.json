The authors recommended that journals reexamine their policies of publishing RCTs as short reports.We examined RCTs published as letters before and after these recommendations. Our interest stems from our involvement in information retrieval for systematic reviews. A rigorous search strategy is a key component in identifying evidence (2), because an inadequate search strategy could result in missed studies and misleading conclusions. Yet, these searches often exclude certain publication types, ...References1. Deeks JJ, Altman DG. Inadequate reporting of controlled trials as short reports [Letter]. Lancet. 1998;352:1908.
