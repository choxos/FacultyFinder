  "title": "Economic Issues in Intercollegiate Athletics: A Book Review Essay",
  "abstract": "The Game of Life and Intercollegiate Athletics challenge presidents, boards, alumni, students, and faculty of the colleges and universities in the United States to rethink the place of athletics in their institutions. William G. Bowen, former president of Princeton University, with coauthor, James L. Shulman, and James J. Duderstadt, former president of the University of Michigan, explore the place of athletics in higher education and reach similar conclusions. The ancient and noble goal of offering all students opportunities to participate in sports has evolved into an arms race that erodes intellectual focus, imposes a substantial financial burden on the institutions, and reduces participation in intercollegiate sports by all but those specially recruited for specific athletic roles. Professional athletic administrations with full-time coaches, substantial recruiting budgets, and elaborate facilities respond to pressures to win by enrolling students with substantially lower academic qualifications than their peers. The Game documents these changes and evaluates their effects on the kind of students enrolled, the education they receive, and the lives they go on to lead. Although The Game does not consider peer effects, recent evidence (Zimmerman 1999; Sacerdote 2001) implies that the gap between athletes' and other students' academic credentials also diminishes the educational experience of nonathletes. Because the motivation and preparation of other students matter to an individual's learning, having substantial numbers of classmates whose motivation is sports and whose academic preparation is limited diminishes the amount of learning for the rest. The pursuit of winning records causes relatively more distortion at our most selective institutions-Princeton and Yale, Stanford and Duke, Swarthmore and Williams. Indeed, as Shulman and Bowen document, because of their relative size, the impact of athletic recruiting is greater at Ivy League and elite private liberal arts colleges and universities than at large public universities. Although only 3% of the men in the University of Michigan's large undergraduate population are on intercollegiate sports teams, this fraction rises to 11% at Duke, 22% at Princeton, and 40% at Williams. An average of 32% of the male graduates of coed liberal arts colleges who entered in 1989 had played on an intercollegiate team, compared to just 9% in Division",
