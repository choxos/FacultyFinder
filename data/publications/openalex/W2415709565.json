To study this concern 8 infant and 3 adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) underwent treatment with the XL1 experimental lithotriptor† to 1 kidney varying the amount of voltage and shocks. Followup consisted of measurement of renin levels and quantitative renal scans, using 131iodine hippurate to calculate effective renal plasma flow. In the infants a slight change was noted in the absolute effective renal plasma flow of the treated kidney versus the untreated side but it was not statistically different. When indexed to body surface area in the growing animal, there was a statistically significant decrease in renal function. However, peripheral renin levels were markedly elevated in the infants at 3 weeks, and they gradually declined during the 6-month period, although levels remained elevated over baseline. The adults also had central renin levels drawn from the renal vein on the treated side, and there was a close correlation with the peripheral levels, which peaked at 3 weeks and returned to normal. Thus, it seems that at least in the short term renin production is increased in infants more than adults. This finding may be an indicator as to renal damage and is a possible explanation for hypertension occurring after ESWL. © 1991 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByMUNVER R, DELVECCHIO F, KUO R, BROWN S, ZHONG P and PREMINGER G (2018) IN VIVO ASSESSMENT OF FREE RADICAL ACTIVITY DURING SHOCK WAVE LITHOTRIPSY USING A MICRODIALYSIS SYSTEM: THE RENOPROTECTIVE ACTION OF ALLOPURINOLJournal of Urology, VOL. 167, NO. 1, (327-334), Online publication date: 1-Jan-2002.Janetschek G, Frauscher F, Knapp R, Hofle G, Peschel R and Bartsch G (2018) New Onset Hypertension After Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy: Age Related Incidence and Prediction by Intrarenal Resistive IndexJournal of Urology, VOL. 158, NO. 2, (346-351), Online publication date: 1-Aug-1997.Strohmaier W, Carl A, Wilbert D and Bichler K (2018) Effects of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy on Plasma Concentrations of Endothelin and Renin in HumansJournal of Urology, VOL. 155, NO. 1, (48-51), Online publication date: 1-Jan-1996.Weber C, Gluck U, Staehler G and Rettig R (2018) Extracorporeal Shock Wave Treatment Raises Blood Pressure in Borderline Hypertensive RatsJournal of Urology, VOL. 154, NO. 1, (232-236), Online publication date: 1-Jul-1995.Wilson W, Husmann D, Morris J, Miller G, Alexander M and Preminger G (2018) A Comparison of the Bioeffects of Four Different Modes of Stone Therapy on Renal Function and MorphologyJournal of Urology, VOL. 150, NO. 4, (1267-1270), Online publication date: 1-Oct-1993.Thomas R, Frentz J, Harmon E and Frentz G (2018) Effect of Extracorporeal Shock Wave Lithotripsy on Renal Function and Body Height in Pediatric PatientsJournal of Urology, VOL. 148, NO. 3 Part 2, (1064-1066), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1992.
