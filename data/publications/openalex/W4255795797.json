  "title": "Primary and Secondary Effects of Water Content on the Spectral Reflectance of Leaves",
  "abstract": "Leaves of six species selected to represent a broad range in internal structure were collected in the field and studied in the laboratory to determine primary and secondary effects of water content on leaf spectral reflectance. Primary effects were those that resulted solely from the radiative properties of water. Secondary effects were those that could not be explained solely by these properties. Decreased leaf water content generally increased reflectance throughout the 400-2,500-nm wavelength range. For the aquatics Eichhornia crassippes and Nuphar luteum, the broadleaved trees Liquidambar styraciflua and Magnolia grandiflora, the cane-grass Arundinaria tecta, and the needle-leaved Pinus taeda, the sensitivity of reflectance to water content was greatest in the water absorption bands near 1,450, 1,940, and 2,500 nm. Sensitivity maxima occurred also between 400 and 720 nm, indicating secondary effects that resulted from decreased absorption by pigments. Secondary effects of water content on reflectance that were largely wavelength-independent, together with any wavelength-independent effects of leaf internal structure, were far less significant than primary and secondary effects resulting from decreased absorption by water and pigments, respectively.",
