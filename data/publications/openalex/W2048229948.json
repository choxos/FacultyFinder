We have previously demonstrated that stem cell homing cytokine MCP-3, and its receptors, are upregulated in urethral tissue after childbirth injury. Recent studies suggest stem cells may facilitate repair by secreting proteins that have paracrine effects. This study investigated whether stem cells homed to the urethra after childbirth injury and facilitated functional recovery of the urethral sphincter. Specifically, the aim of this study was to determine if intravenous (IV) bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) improved urethral sphincter function compared to local administration of concentrated conditioned media (CCM) containing growth factors produced by the cells. METHODS Age-matched virgin female rats were divided into 6 groups: Vaginal Distension (VD) and IV saline (N=6), VD and IV MSCs (N=7), sham VD and IV saline (N=5), VD and CCM direct sphincter injection (N=5), VD and control media injection (N=4) and sham VD and control media injection (N=5). VD was done as previously described. One hour after injury, 2 million GFP-labeled MSCs or saline was injected via tail vein. MSC conditioned media was concentrated (CCM) and injected directly into the urethra. Outcomes were tested 1 week after injury by simultaneous leak point pressure (LPP) and external urethral sphincter (EUS) electromyography (EMG). Mean frequency and amplitude of 1 sec EUS EMG segments both at rest and during LPP were analyzed. Urethras and vaginas were harvested and imaged ex-vivo for MSCs GFP. RESULTS Continence (LPP) was significantly reduced in VD rats treated with saline or control media compared to sham VD but not in those given IV MSCs or CCM. EUS EMG frequency and amplitude, as well as LPP were significantly decreased in all VD rats, regardless of treatment, compared to sham VD. GFP imaging showed increased fluorescence, indicating MSCs, in the urethra and vagina of VD rats receiving IV MSCs. CONCLUSIONS IV MSCs home to the urethra and facilitate recovery of continence after childbirth injury, but not by increasing EUS function. Therefore, improved LPP likely results from the local secretion of paracrine factors by MSCs. The exact mechanism of action leading to restored continence requires further investigation. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byGill B, Damaser M, Vasavada S and Goldman H (2018) Stress Incontinence in the Era of Regenerative Medicine: Reviewing the Importance of the Pudendal NerveJournal of Urology, VOL. 190, NO. 1, (22-28), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2013.
