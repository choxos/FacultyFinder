  "title": "Kidney function estimated by creatinine and cystatin C and adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation",
  "abstract": "The association of impaired kidney function with ischemic and bleeding events in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is important for treatment decisions regarding anticoagulation. We aimed to compare the associations and discriminatory performance of kidney function estimations by cystatin C (eGFRcy), creatinine (eGFRcr), both biomarkers combined (eGFRc2), and the ratio of eGFRcy/eGFRcr (eGFRra) with ischemic events and major bleedings [1, 2]. We combined data from the prospective Swiss AF Study [3] and the Beat- AF Study [4]. All different estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) models were calculated using the sex and age-specific CKD-EPI formula [5]. The ischemic outcome was major cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of ischemic stroke, systemic embolism (SE), myocardial infarction (MI), and cardiovascular (CV) death. The bleeding outcome was defined by the criteria of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis for major bleeding [6]. Detailed outcome definitions and methods are provided in the supplement. The studies were approved by the lead ethics commission, and all study centers received approval from the individual regional ethical committees. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02105844. We included 3867 participants: mean age 71 ± 10 years, 28% female, and 49% paroxysmal AF (Table S1). Mean eGFRcr, eGFRcy, and eGFRc2 were 63 ± 20, 64 ± 26, and 64 ± 23 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Over a median follow-up of 6 years, 738 MACE (3.22/100 patient-years; 487 CV deaths, 206 ischemic strokes/SE, and 155 MI) occurred with increasing incidence rates over decreasing eGFRc2 categories (1.10–11.45 from lowest to highest) (Table S2). Cumulative incidence curves of MACE and major bleeding stratified by combined eGFR levels are shown in Fig. 1a. For MACE, the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence interval [CI]) per 10 mL/min/1.73 m2 decrease of eGFRc2, eGFRcr, and eGFRcy were 1.16 (95% CI 1.11–1.21, p < 0.001), 1.09 (1.04–1.14, p < 0.001), and 1.18 (1.13–1.23, p < 0.001), respectively, and per 1-point decrease in eGFRra 3.46 (2.42, 4.93, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1b, Table S3). Fig. S1 shows the HRs over continuous eGFR levels. Besides CV death, no individual MACE component was associated with any eGFR calculation (Table S3). The Akaike information criterion (AIC) fIor MACE was lower for eGFRcy (10930.58), eGFRc2 (10949.01), and eGFRra (10938.92) compared to eGFRcr (10975.97). The bleeding outcome occurred in 423 participants (1.85/100 patient-years) with increasing incidence rates over decreasing eGFRc2 categories (0.80–4.57 from lowest to highest) (Table S2). Cumulative incidence curves for major bleeding stratified by eGFRc2, eGFRcr, eGFRcy, and eGFRra are shown in Fig. 1a and Figs. S2–S4. For major bleeding, HRs (95% CI) were significant for eGFRcy (1.11 [1.05–1.17], p < 0.001), eGFRc2 (1.09 [1.03–1.16], p = 0.005), and eGFRra (2.10 [1.34–3.30], p = 0.001), but not for eGFRcr (1.04 [0.98–1.10], p = 0.24). The AC for major bleeding were lower for eGFRcy (6533.73), eGFRc2 (6539.60), and eGFRra (6536.40) compared to eGFRcr (6546.23). Results were consistent in sensitivity analyses adding lifestyle factors (Table S4). In our prospective cohort of AF patients, 19.0% experienced an ischemic and 10.9% a major bleeding event over 6 years. Patients with reduced kidney function below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 had an excess risk of ischemic and major bleeding events. Only cystatin c-based eGFR estimations and eGFR-ratio were consistently associated with both ischemic and bleeding events. In a post hoc study from ARISTOTLE, cystatin C–based equations showed less variation and higher prognostic value for death and major bleeding, but ischemic stroke/embolism was not investigated [7]. We expand these prior findings to a clinically useful ischemic endpoint and show that cystatin C–based equations might be preferential in AF patients for treatment decisions. Potential mechanisms for improved diagnostic accuracy and stronger associations by cystatin C may include its metabolism. It is continually synthesized in all nucleated cells, not actively secreted, and due to its low molecular weight, it is almost completely filtered in the glomerulus and catabolized in the proximal tubule [8, 9]. This leads to a higher stability in serum concentration. In contrast, creatinine is primarily released by muscles, partially actively secreted by the proximal tubule and by the gastrointestinal system. Thus, its levels may be unstable and result in an over-/underestimation of kidney function [10]. A mismatch between the eGFRcy and eGFRcr can be quantified by the eGFRra, which may indicate a shrunken pore syndrome [2]. Limitations of our study include biomarker measurements at baseline only, limited generalizability to other patient populations, and the observational design. In conclusion, patients with AF and reduced kidney function had an excess risk of ischemic and major bleeding events compared to patients with normal kidney function. Cystatin C–based GFR estimations and the calculated GFR ratio were consistently associated both with ischemic and bleeding events, whereas creatinine-based GFR estimations were only associated with ischemic events. Moreover, cystatin C-based GFR estimations outperformed creatinine-based estimations in terms of discriminatory performance for both endpoints.
