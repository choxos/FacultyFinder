  "title": "Fire effects on surface‐atmosphere energy exchange in Alaskan black spruce ecosystems: Implications for feedbacks to regional climate",
  "abstract": "Although fire is crucial to the functioning and diversity of boreal forests, the second largest biome on Earth, there are few detailed studies of the effects of disturbance on surface‐atmosphere interactions in these regions. We conducted tower‐based micrometeorological measurements in summer over six recently burned black spruce stands that varied in age between 0 and 14 years. Results are presented for nonprecipitating conditions. There was an initial reduction of minimum albedo following fire from ∼0.09 to 0.06 followed by a rapid increase to 0.135 as the cover of successional vegetation increased. For clear‐sky conditions near local solar noon, the combined effects of increased surface temperature due to a reduced surface‐atmospheric coupling and albedo reduced midday net radiation by 9.3% (∼70 W m −2 ) for the first decade of succession. The average daily net radiation declined by 5.5%. Near noon, the relative partitioning of net radiation into ground heat flux doubled compared to nearby unburned stands, although on a daily basis the increase was only significant for the first few years following fire. Reduced net radiation, enhanced ground heat flux, and reduced Bowen ratio values following the first decade of succession could lead to a midday reduction of approximately 80 W m −2 in sensible heat flux compared to an unburned stand. Across a fire‐scar boundary, the contrast in sensible heating and roughness is sufficiently large to induce mesoscale circulations and possibly trigger convective development. Because fire scars frequently exceed 10 4 ha, locally cooler conditions would prevail with suppressed planetary boundary layer development. Given the abundance of fire disturbance throughout interior Alaska, these effects may contribute to the regional climate patterns.",
