  "title": "Role of Respiratory Obstruction in \"Neuropathic\" Pulmonary Edema Following Vagotomy",
  "abstract": "Reports by Weiser1 and Farber2 have suggested that pulmonary congestion and edema, fatal within a period of hours, are specific consequences of bilateral vagotomy in the rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. In the larger common laboratory animals (cat and dog) this is not the case.3, 4, 5 This study was undertaken in an effort to determine the basis for this difference.Doubly vagotomized rats and guinea pigs in which tracheotomy was first done were kept alive many hours longer than the longest survivals reported,1, 2 without evidence of pulmonary edema. Tracheotomy consisted of a simple transverse slit, handling of the trachea being avoided. The animals were fixed on their backs throughout the procedure to permit care of the wound. Cannulation, which would have circumvented this, was found unsatisfactory because of the difficulty in maintaining a free air-way. In spite of all precautions, tracheal secretions produced respiratory obstruction in a number of animals. Death with pulmonary congestion and edema followe...",
