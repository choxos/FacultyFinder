  "title": "An Analysis of Statistical Techniques Used in the Journal of Educational Psychology, 1979-1983",
  "abstract": "Abstract Several issues of concern to professors of educational psychology, statistics, measurement, and research design are discussed, based on an analysis of the statistical techniques used in the Journal of Educational Psychology (JEP) over the past 5 years. The statistical techniques are tabulated, grouped as to level of coursework (basic, intermediate, and advanced), and matched with statistics texts currently in use. The findings indicate that most of the techniques used by JEP researchers are basic- or intermediate-level, suggesting that students who have taken a two-semester sequence in statistics would understand most of the statistical procedures they would encounter in JEP. Other issues addressed concern the appropriateness of some statistical techniques used in JEP, and trends in the use of specific techniques over time.",
