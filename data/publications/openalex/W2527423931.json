  "title": "Intensive Mothering on the Homefront: An Analysis of Army Mothers",
  "abstract": "This research includes interviews with 10 U.S. Army wives and mothers to examine mothering within the military context. Findings reveal what I label “military motherwork,” a mothering style similar to civilian mothering described in the marriage and family literature. Similar to civilian mothers, they feel more responsible for maintaining the household and taking care of their needs, both physically and emotionally, compared to their husbands. They also often engage in what Sharon Hays (1996 Hays, Sharon. 1996. The Cultural Contradictions of Motherhood. New Haven, CT: Yale University Press. [Google Scholar]) described as intensive mothering, in which parents use the majority of their resources and focus much of their time to improve their children’s lives. However, military motherwork is also unique in that mothers raise their children within the military institution and must adapt to deployment and all of the risks associated with combat. Intensive mothering within the civilian motherhood literature remains relevant to military mothers, as evidenced in interviews, but also modified to suit military lifestyles.",
