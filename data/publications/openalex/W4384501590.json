Several comments have raised concerns, which we address here.One concern raised by Dr. Brosseau and Dr. Hedges and colleagues is a lack of equipoise. The fact that policies about the use of medical masks versus N95 respirators for routine care of patients with COVID-19 varied between jurisdictions is indisputable evidence of equipoise. The trial was conducted only at health care facilities in jurisdictions where wearing medical masks was the policy for routine care of patients with COVID-19. Our study underwent independent peer review by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research; 10 ethics review boards; and the Tri-Council Federal Office Panel, the organization that creates framework and guidance for the ethical conduct of research in Canada. No concerns were noted.A general comment was that complex interventions do not need to be subject to randomized trials as noted by Dr. Greenhalgh and associates and that one could rather rely on mechanistic or laboratory studies, limited observational studies, and a flawed systematic review (2). Observational and mechanistic data can have significant unrecognized biases and real-world implementation issues that can be overcome only by randomization, where the principles of evidence-based medicine prevail in shaping appropriate interventions. There is a legacy of interventions relying on mechanistic data that were reversed on the basis of well-done randomized controlled trials (3).Although Drs. Fisman and Macintyre raised concerns that participants did not adhere to universal masking, we have more than 7500 reports where participants attested to always using the medical mask or N95 respirator they were allocated to over their entire shift. Drs. Fisman and Macintyre also questioned recruitment outside of Canada. The expanded recruitment efforts were justified because we could no longer enroll participants in Canada because of vaccine rollout. The suggestion that we should have stopped the study and conducted an unplanned subgroup analysis does not make sense (4). We increased the sample size to increase the power of the trial and account for participants who could not complete the 10 weeks of follow-up because of mRNA vaccination.Drs. Fisman and Macintyre have also conducted a post hoc power calculation to suggest that our study was underpowered. Power is a pretrial concept; once the trial is completed, the focus should be on the CIs (5). We acknowledged in the article that the noninferiority margin was wide. However, the absolute risk difference was 1.19% (95% CI, –2.5% to 4.9%), values that should be reassuring to physicians and other health care workers. The findings indicate that medical masks may offer noninferior protection to N95 respirators within the types of settings observed in the trial (1).Dr. Delaine is correct to say that medical masks were noninferior to N95 respirators. However, this is not because “their trial did not show superiority” of N95 respirators; it is because the greatest possible difference in effectiveness when comparing medical masks with N95 respirators that is compatible with the data (as determined by the upper limit of the 95% CI) fell within the noninferiority margin. Noninferiority trials test whether an intervention is “not inferior” or “not unacceptably worse” than the intervention used as the control (6). In contrast, equivalence trials are designed to show that 2 interventions do not differ in either direction by more than a specified amount.This study is the only completed randomized controlled trial of surgical masks versus N95 respirators in the setting of COVID-19, an achievement that should be commended in a time of research instability. Some of the less scientifically based comments may discourage future high-quality research during public health emergencies.References1. Chou R.
