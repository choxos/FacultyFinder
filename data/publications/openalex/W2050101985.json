  "title": "Purchasing Power: Oil, Elections and Regime Durability in Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan",
  "abstract": "Abstract This article examines the link between oil abundance and regime durability by providing insight into how and why oil-rich leaders use elections to maintain power. Using data from presidential elections in Central Asia, the article argues that oil-rich leaders are better able to manipulate their economies in the run-up to elections than their resource-poor counterparts. Oil-rich leaders use oil profits to increase pre-electoral spending to increase popular support, to deter potential opposition and to secure elite loyalty. Such electorally timed increases in spending help oil-rich leaders increase their re-election prospects and ensure their continued control over their countries' resources. Notes Moral hazard models describe situations when a party with relatively more information than another makes decisions that the party with less information would consider ‘immoral’. These models arise under conditions of information asymmetry, or when one group has more information than another. The moral hazard model builds on the earlier adverse-selection models of Rogoff and Sibert (1998) and Rogoff (Citation1990). The Associated Press, 2 November 2006. Other research suggests that incentives for budget manipulation are greater when the incumbent has a positive probability of losing office (Block Citation2001; Schultz Citation1995). These studies argue that electoral cycles are costly for incumbents because of their impact on future macroeconomic performance and the incumbent's reputation, once the manipulation comes to light. Incumbents are only willing to create electorally timed distortions if they are compensated by ‘ego rents’, or the private boost in self-esteem that comes with electoral victory (Schultz Citation1995). However, in cases where elections are not competitive, and incumbents face a near zero probability of losing office, ego rents are not at stake and the incentive to distort is greatly diminished. This argument suggests that the leaders of oil-rich countries should have little incentive to manipulate the economy prior to elections. However, as argued above, elections in authoritarian regimes are a mechanism to extend regime survival ensuring that ego rents continue into the future. The creation of supermajority victory margins and massive voter turnout may be viewed as evidence that elections in authoritarian regimes also generate ego rents for these leaders. See Tsebelis (1995, 2000) for a discussion on the effect of checks and balances, or veto players, on political change. In sum, Tsebelis finds that more veto players in a political system make it more likely that the system will adhere to the status quo. Gelb (Citation1988, p. 66) found that in a sample of six oil-abundant countries, non-oil taxation was little over half of what it was for typical countries at similar levels of GNP. In contrast to a tax-dependent state that must devote so much energy to extracting its operating revenues from society, a distributive state simply must decide which social groups are to be the favoured recipients of oil rents. Beblawi and Luciani note that oil revenues enable the state to ‘buy off political consensus’ (1987, p. 7). Because the election took place in the second half of the year, fiscal manipulations are expected to occur in the year of the election, rather than the year before. International Monetary Fund (IMF) data are not available for Turkmenistan. In the cases of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, the fiscal deficit is measured using the non-oil primary balance as a percent of non-oil GDP, while in the resource-poor countries, the fiscal deficit is measured as the primary balance as a percent of GDP. The use of the non-oil primary balance in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan provides a more accurate picture of the government's fiscal actions than the overall primary balance, enabling a more direct comparison between the pre-electoral fiscal policies in the oil-rich and relatively resource-poor countries. The non-oil primary balance is uncorrelated with the price of oil and therefore provides the clearest picture of the fiscal stance in oil-rich countries (IMF 2009). As with the primary balance in the resource-poor Central Asian countries, an increase in the non-oil primary deficit in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan indicates an expansionary fiscal policy affected either through increasing expenditure or through a reduction in revenue. In addition to Azerbaijan's informal economy, the tax base continues to remain below its potential because of a costly system of tax exemptions regarding Value Added Taxation (VAT), and customs administration problems that continue to undermine taxes from non-oil customs duties (IMF 2008). The tax changes included reductions in the VAT rate from 16% to 15% and in the highest personal income tax rate from 30% to 20%. The social (payroll) tax rate was reduced from a flat 21% to a range from 7% to 20%. Interview with author, 11 November 2007, Baku, Azerbaijan.
