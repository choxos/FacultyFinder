  "abstract": "The article presents a poorly recognized thread in the history of the German occupation of Bialystok. In September 1939, a wave of refugees from other parts of Poland flowed into the city and region. Among them were a significant number of artists, mainly – though not exclusively – of Jewish origin. Under Soviet occupation, they were absorbed into the propaganda machine, painting portraits of officials and decorations for state holidays. Their fate changed after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, when the Jews were confined to a ghetto. There, a Wehrmacht officer set up a workshop for artistic copies or, rather, forged paintings, employing some 20 painters. Few witnesses claimed that the production of paintings was very large and was sent to art dealers in the Third Reich, France, the Netherlands and other occupied countries. The further fate of the paintings painted in the ghetto remains unknown.",
