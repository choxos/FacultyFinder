  "title": "The Instructional and Technological Challenges of a Web Based Course in Educational Statistics and Measurement",
  "abstract": "This paper describes the development of the Web site for a graduate course in statistics and measurement, and offers recommendations for future continued development of this and other Web-based courses within the field of education. The site was initially designed to supplement the course as it was currently being taught. An overview of the basic structure of the Web site and how specific units are being converted to be delivered online is presented. As a part of a formative evaluation, students enrolled in the class were surveyed regarding their perceptions of the Web site and how it had contributed to their educational experiences. Although apprehensive at first, student response to the Web site was very positive.
