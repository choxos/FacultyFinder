There is an ongoing Cochrane review on this subject; its protocol is published (2), and its results have been reported in abstract form (3). Fuccio and colleagues report that eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori reduces the subsequent incidence of gastric cancer. However, we have serious doubts about the accuracy of their analysis. In the Methods section of their article, Fuccio and colleagues state that when they found multiple articles for a single study, they used the latest publication from each eligible study. However, the meta-analysis ...References1. Fuccio L, Zagari RM, Eusebi LH, Laterza L, Cennamo V, Ceroni L, et al.
