An actuarial analysis was done on survival comparing patients whose cancer was diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate to those diagnosed by needle biopsy. This analysis indicated a doubling of recurrence and of deaths of patients diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate. This effect of transurethral resection of the prostate was observed in patients with T3 and T4 cancer of intermediate, poor or unstated differentiation. It was not observed in those with well differentiated cancer. The effect was not caused by a difference in the extent of cancer or a distribution of histologic subtypes between the 2 diagnostic groups. Therefore, it appears that transurethral resection of the prostate causes dissemination on locally advanced prostatic cancer and clinical studies are suggested to avoid or minimize this effect. © 1983 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByGomella L, Raj G and Moreno J (2018) Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for Prostate Specific Antigen in the Management of Prostate CancerJournal of Urology, VOL. 158, NO. 2, (326-337), Online publication date: 1-Aug-1997.Hanks G (2018) Re: The Risk of Distant Metastases after Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Versus Needle Biopsy in Patients with Localized Prostate Cancer, by R.
