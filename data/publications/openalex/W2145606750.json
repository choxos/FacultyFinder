  "title": "Stress in Pediatric Oncology Nurses",
  "abstract": "Although the onset of physiological and emotional stress can greatly affect outcomes for a child with cancer, the focus of this review targets pediatric oncology nurses and their daily occupation-related stress. Literature currently exists that discusses the etiology of stress in the oncology work environment as well as coping strategies and their effects on pediatric oncology nurses’ stress levels. To date, however, no literature review has been assembled to comprehensively address practice implications and provide recommendations for pediatric oncology staff nurses. This review of literature seeks to provide a general overview of stress experienced in the pediatric oncology work environment and supportive interventions to decrease negative outcomes such as compassion fatigue and burnout. Recommendations and conclusions are made based on existing interventions, thus creating a framework for future research to be conducted to compare the effectiveness of these measures and optimize patient experiences through caregiver well-being.",
