  "title": "Primary and secondary niobium mineral deposits associated with carbonatites",
  "abstract": "This work reviews the character and origin of primary and supergene economic deposits of niobium associated with carbonatites. The Brazilian supergene deposits account for about 92% of the total worldwide production of Nb, with the primary St. Honoré carbonatite and other sources accounting for only for 7 and 1%, respectively. The emphasis of the review is upon the styles of Nb mineralization and the geological factors which lead to economic concentrations of Nb-bearing minerals. Primary economic deposits of Nb are associated principally with carbonatites found in diverse types of plutonic alkaline rock complexes. Primary magmas are principally those of the melilitite, nephelinite and aillikite clans. Although many primary niobium deposits are associated with carbonatites, ijolites and syenites in the same alkaline complexes can also contain significant Nb mineralization in the form of niobian titanite and diverse Nb–Zr-silicates (marianoite-wöhlerite); these potential sources of Nb have not as yet been explored or exploited. Primary Nb deposits can be regarded as large tonnage, low grade (typically < 1 wt.% Nb2O5) disseminated ore deposits. Niobium is hosted principally by diverse Na–Ca–U-pyrochlores, ferrocolumbite and fersmite. Every actual, and potential, primary Nb deposit is unique with respect to the varieties of pyrochlore present; extent of replacement by other minerals; and degree of alteration by deuteric/hydrothermal fluids. Within a given occurrence individual petrographically-defined units of carbonatite contain distinct suites of pyrochlore. Bulk rock analysis for Nb gives no indication of the style of mineralization and provides no information of use regarding beneficiation of the ore. Evaluation of any Nb deposit requires extensive definition drilling and detailed mineralogical studies. Primary Nb deposits result from the early crystallization of Nb-bearing minerals in magma chambers followed by crystal fractionation, magma mixing, and redistribution of Nb-minerals by density currents. Supergene Nb deposits occur in laterites formed by extensive weathering of primary carbonatites. The process results in the decomposition of apatite and magnetite, removal of soluble carbonates and physical concentration of resistant primary pyrochlore. Intense lateritization results initially in the replacement of primary pyrochlores by supergene, commonly Ba, Sr, K or Pb-bearing pyrochlores, and ultimately complete decomposition of pyrochlore and formation of Nb-bearing rutile, brookite, and anatase. The Nb contents of the laterites can be enriched up to 10 times or more above those of the primary carbonatite. Commonly, pyrochlores in laterites are fine grained and intimately intergrown with hematite, goethite and minerals of the crandallite group. The different styles of mineralization of primary and secondary Nb deposits require different methods of ore beneficiation.",
