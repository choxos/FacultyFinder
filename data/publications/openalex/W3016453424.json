  "title": "Seminar som undervisningsform i høgere utdanning",
  "abstract": "Seminar is a form of teaching that is widely used in universities and university colleges in Norway. The article asks three questions about the seminar as a form of teaching: what is a seminar, how can seminars be used, and why should seminars be used as a teaching method in higher education. The article’s empirical data is taken from a case study conducted by the author, and revolves seminars as a learning arena in higher education. The chapter refers to a concrete programme and the conduction of a seminar in order to shed light on the importance of student-active learning forms. In addition, references are made to statements from both vocational teachers and students who have participated in the research study. Through analysis of empirical findings and concrete examples, theory is mainly derived from collaborative learning, situated learning and the importance of reflection for learning. One of the main findings is that seminars must be well planned, there must be high commitment on the vocational teachers’ part, and there must be a clear connection between themes in lectures and seminars. The students experience that they gain an understanding of the connection between theory and practice by having a lecture on one day, and a seminar built on the same theme two days later. The students also express through evaluation that they experience the seminars as educational, engaging, challenging and motivating.",
