  "abstract": "Nicole SimunovicView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Vikas KhandujaView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is an honor of a lifetime to take the role of Editor in Chief of the Journal of ISAKOS. Niek Van Dijk has led this journal with Leendert Blankevoort since its inception, and they have done a commendable job. Their successes were recently noted with the increased recognition of the journal as a beacon of academic excellence and the establishment of the important impact factor of 1.6! This is quite an accomplishment for a journal that is still developing and finding its way among the vast number of orthopedic titles. I do recognize that succeeding at this role is a team effort, and I would like to introduce some important members of our editorial team. First, Mr. Vikas Khanduja is the new Associate Editor in Chief and partner in this opportunity. He brings a tremendous amount of knowledge, expertise, and innovation to the journal. He has served as a leader in several organizations including the past President of the British Hip Society and President-Elect of SICOT. Next, I would like to introduce you to the next Managing Editor of the journal, Ms. Nicole Simunovic. She is currently the Research Manager of the McMaster University Sports Medicine Research Collaborative and has an extensive publication and administrative leadership record relating to clinical trials and health research methodology. As the new Editor in Chief, I bring experience as a joint preservation specialist with a robust clinical research program focused on evidence-based medicine, as well as prior expertise in the editorial process. The key, however, to our collective success remains all of you â€“ our ISAKOS members. Whether you serve the journal as a Reviewer, Editorial Board Member, Associate Editor, or simply reader of published articles, we welcome your input and support. Without it, we can only hope to make modest gains for the journal. What you can expect from us is to build on the previous team's record and continue to propel the journal forward with inclusive excellence. This means developing innovative publication formats, designing programs that lead to publications from low- to middle-income countries, and utilizing social media to enhance our journal's offerings while staying true to the principles of evidence-based medicine. Success will take more effort than ever before, but we believe that our unified team can accomplish great things. We are humbled and energized by the support we have received to date, and we are ready to get to work. Thank you all for this opportunity, and we are ready to work as a team, with all of you as our teammates. The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests: Olufemi R. Ayeni reports a relationship with the Journal of ISAKOS that includes employment. Dr. Ayeni is supported in part by a Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Joint Preservation Surgery. Dr. Ayeni is also the Editor in Chief for the Journal of ISAKOS. Dr. Khanduja is the Associate Editor for the Journal of ISAKOS. Nicole Simunovic is the Managing Editor for the Journal of ISAKOS.",
