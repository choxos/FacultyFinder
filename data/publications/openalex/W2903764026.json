  "title": "TARGET, PRESCRIPTION AND INFUSION OF ENTERAL NUTRITIONAL THERAPY OF CRITICAL PATIENTS IN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Enteral nutritional therapy (ENT) is the best route for the nutrition of critically ill patients with improved impact on the clinical treatment of such patients. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the energy and protein supply of ENT in critically ill in-patients of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). METHODS: Prospective longitudinal study conducted with 82 critically ill in-patients of an ICU, receiving ENT. Anthropometric variables, laboratory tests (albumin, CRP, CRP/albumin ratio), NUTRIC-score and Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS-2002), energy and protein goals, and the inadequacies and complications of ENT were assessed. Statistical analysis was performed using the Chi-square or Fischer tests and the Wilcoxon test. RESULTS: A total of 48.78% patients were at high nutritional risk based on NUTRIC score. In the CRP/albumin ratio, 85.37% patients presented with a high risk of complications. There was a statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.0001) for all comparisons made between the target, prescription and ENT infusion, and 72% of the quantities prescribed for both calories and proteins was infused. It was observed that the difference between the prescription and the infusion was 14.63% (±10.81) for calories and 14.21% (±10.5) for proteins, with statistically significant difference (P&lt;0.0001). In the relationship between prescription and infusion of calories and proteins, the only significant association was that of patients at high risk of CRP/albumin ratio, of which almost 94% received less than 80% of the energy and protein volume prescribed (P=0.0111). CONCLUSION: The administration of ENT in severely ill patients does not meet their actual energy and protein needs. The high occurrence of infusion inadequacies, compared to prescription and to the goals set can generate a negative nutritional balance.",
