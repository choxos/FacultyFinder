  "title": "Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H)-Induced Coagulopathy in Renal Transplantation",
  "abstract": "We highlight the case of 42-year-old woman who underwent living related kidney transplantation and suffered marked coagulopathy and postoperative bleeding in which alemtuzumab (Campath) was used as induction immunosuppression before surgery. She had no other significant comorbidity including history of hereditary blood disorders. The patient received alemtuzumab (20 mg infused with 100 mL normal saline more than 2 hr) and methylprednisalone 1 g at induction, and maintenance immunosuppression with tacrolimus (Prograf, Astellas Pharma Inc.). The operative procedure was uneventful with uniform reperfusion and immediate function. After 24 hr, she became heamodynamically unstable with an acute fall in hemoglobin. At operation, fresh blood superficial and deep to muscle layers with general ooze from all cut surfaces was observed, with little or no evidence of a clot. There was no bleeding from the anastomosis, renal hilum, or ureteric mesentery. A coagulation profile and hematology consultation did not reveal cause for the coagulopathy at this time and no heparin was administered in the clinical course. A second exploration for bleeding after 24 hr necessitated packing the transplant bed with gauze and administering further blood products. An intraoperative coagulation profile highlighted an elevated prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time of 18 and 80 sec, respectively, and a thrombin time of more than 60 sec, a fibrinogen of 2.9 g/L, and a platelet count 49Ã—109/L. The packs were removed next day with marked improvement in the appearance of the operative field and the wound closed. The total amount of blood products administered in the 72 hr after initial operation are as follows: 10 units whole blood, 12 units fresh frozen plasma, one adult dose platelets, and cryoprecipitate. There was no graft dysfunction or infective complications during her 14-day hospital stay, and the patient remains well. Alemtuzumab (Campath 1H) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a glycoprotein found on the surface of T and B lymphocytes, monocytes, and natural killer cells (1). It has been used in organ transplantation with good short-term outcomes (2), and more recently in centers as an induction agent in kidney, liver, and pancreas transplantation (3, 4). Watson et al. reporting 5-year interim results of its use of the drug and concluded satisfactory long-term patient and graft survival equivalent to standard triple immunosuppression. Importantly, they noted no significant difference from control groups in terms of infection or serious adverse events including postoperative bleeding (5). There exist few literature highlighting alemtuzumab-associated coagulopathy in kidney transplantation. The only two reports available highlight a similar clinical course as our patient, involving deranged intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathway parameters, repeated re-exploration for bleeding, and significant requirements for blood products (6), (7). The coagulopathy resolved within 48 to 72 hr but had important associated morbidity in the patient. The precise mechanism of this observation remains to be fully explained but an awareness of this potential complication is important to all who are using alemtuzumab induction therapy. Clatworthy et al. (8) report similar outcomes with of subcutaneous alemtuzumab in simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplants as intravenous use without any bleeding effects, whereas Ku et al. recommend administration in the postoperative setting when surgical wounds are more secure (6).
