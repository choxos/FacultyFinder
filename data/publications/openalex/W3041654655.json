  "title": "Duck production in Ibadan metropolis area of Oyo State, Nigeria",
  "abstract": "Ducks are domesticated birds that are reared for their meat and eggs like other poultry, but in Nigeria many are yet to see opportunity in duck production as it is less embraced compare to other types of poultry. This is mainly because duck rearing is not economically viable as its eggs and meat are not widely consumed as that of chickens in many homes in the country. On these premises, this study was carried out to investigate duck production in Ibadan metropolis of Oyo State. A random sampling technique was used to select four local governments from the six in Ibadan less city. Thirty respondents were purposively chosen from each selected local government area. The results showed that female dominates duck production and were raised majorly for household consumption. The paper identified restricted market access and non-availability of improved husbandry as major constraint to duck production in the area. The paper concluded that although duck meat has no big market but is widely consumed in rural areas. Thus, rural communities can be encouraged to rear and eat duck, to bridge noticed protein gap in rural communities. In this regard, educating the populace about the significance of duck farming and promotion of research in improved duck husbandry becomes imperative.",
