  "abstract": "A glance at the titles of the articles in this issue of in education (Autumn 2015) brings many words to mind to describe the contemporary educational landscape: eclectic, emotional, complex, and bureaucratic, to name but a few.A closer look, however, points to some shared visions in this landscape: education as a site of struggle, resistance, and courage; places of respect and reciprocity; places of mentorship and of collaboration and sharing; places that accommodate and even celebrate difference, and places that seek new paths to understanding.All of the articles discuss various transformative aspects of the educational work the authors are doing.The peer-reviewed articles in Volume 21.2 of in education serve to remind us that education is above all a human endeavour.This is its wonder and its curse.These articles show not only the initiatives of individuals, but also the flaws in the educational systems and structures we have built.Brenda McMahon's qualitative study seeks to understand the experiences of successful university students whose prior experiences in high school were a struggle.One implication of the study is recognition of \"the role that educators can play in creating equitable, democratic schools\" (p.19).Jesse Butler in his analysis of Ontario's Indigenous Education Policy quotes Thomas King's tongue in-cheek definition of government policy: \"For an individual, one of the definitions of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again in the same way and expecting different results.For a government, such behaviour is called … policy\" (p.27).I am reminded that in education we, by necessity, are in a constant state of flux, understanding the need to constantly revise and re-envision.This is what learning is.In this issue, human learning is tied to key words such as resilience, relationships, identity, and transformation.In their article on duoethnographic inquiry, Jackie Seidel and Laurie Hill quote Derrida's description of the inability to decide \"not as inaction or paralysis in the face of a decision, but as the responsibility and necessity to choose.He insists that this is the beginning ground of all ethics and politics.\"The authors add, \"and we propose this as the beginning ground of all pedagogical work, too\" (p.52).The articles in this issue reflect what they describe as \"the deeply personal yet public nature of curriculum [and all educational] work\" (p.63).In a very personal exploration, Michele Tanaka's account of \"supporting preservice teachers in their personal journeys towards decolonizing and indigenizing\" uses poetic expression to describe her search for courage to leave patterned thinking and knowing aside.She writes, \"It would be easier if there were prescriptive steps as to how to decolonize or take an indigenous approach, but this is impossible given our complexity as individuals and in relationship\" (p.82).Similarly, Damara Goff Paris's illustrated article on Art-Based Ways of Knowing shows transformation through \"identification with Indigenous art forms, strength in spirituality, and evolution of cultural identities\" (p.141).Similarly, using Innu poems and translations, and visuals, Julie Vaudrin-Charette explores post-colonial \"pedagogical implications lying within public and intimate in education 21(2) Autumn 2015",
