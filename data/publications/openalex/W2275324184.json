  "title": "<i>Innovating in Urban Economies: Economic Transformation in Canadian City-Regions</i>edited by David A. Wolfe",
  "abstract": "Too frequently the ‘flyover states’ are dismissed in the USA, as if the only thing of significance between New York and Los Angeles is an island atop of which sits Chicago. Much the same thing happens in Canada, with Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver dominating discussions on most topics, but especially when it comes to innovation. Innovating in Urban Economies: Economic Transformation in Canadian City-Regions does a thorough, perhaps excellent, job in looking beyond the major cities, and even sheds some new light on the innovation system within the big guys. I was unsure what to expect in this volume. Given the subject, part of me thought it would be dominated by Richard Florida, with methodology designed to support his broader ideas. Another part of me thought that the aforementioned big-city bias would shine through. Yet another part of me thought that this would be another book struggling with the ‘What is innovation, anyway?’ question. It turns out that it is a little bit of all of those and all of none of them.",
