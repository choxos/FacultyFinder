The Clavien-Dindo (CD) grading system categorizes by the most significant complication. The Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI), however, is a scoring system which captures all complications on a continuous scale thereby accounting for the cumulative impact of all events. Here, we compare the CCI and CD systems for classifying complications in a cohort of patients undergoing RNU. METHODS The charts of 110 consecutive patients undergoing RNU were reviewed. All complications occurring within 30 days of surgery were identified and graded by the CD classification system and values for CCI were calculated. Logistic regression was used to determined associations between CD and CCI with perioperative covariates, and multivariate modeling investigated association with hospital length of stay (LOS). RESULTS Sixty-seven men and 43 women with a median age of 71, BMI of 29, eGFR of 64 ml/min/1.73m2, and Charlson score of 4 were included. 13% of the patients received a blood transfusion intraoperatively. 75% underwent a minimally invasive RNU, 47% had a LND, and 7% received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Median hospital LOS was 4 days (range, 2–22). Overall, 41 patients (37%) experienced a total of 47 complications including 12 major (≥ Clavien III) and 35 minor. Mean CCI for our cohort was 8.71 (range, 0 – 100). The upper quartile of CCI (> 75th %) was associated with higher Charlson score (p=0.03), lower baseline eGFR (p=0.005), intraoperative transfusion (p=0.004), open surgical approach (p=0.019), and symptoms at presentation (p=0.015). Major CD complications were also associated with these same variables. (Table) However, on multivariate analysis, only the upper quartile of CCI was associated with length of stay (8.25 vs. 5.61 days, p<0.0001) whilst major CD complications were not (7.98 vs. 6.32, p=0.211) CONCLUSIONS The CCI and CD classification schemes are both associated with similar baseline and perioperative characteristics for RNU patients. However, the cumulative nature of CCI appears to permit more accurate prediction of LOS following surgery compared to the CD system.
