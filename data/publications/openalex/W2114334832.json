  "title": "The adoption and implementation of evidence-based practice (EBP) among allied health professions",
  "abstract": "Background and aims: Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely accepted within patient care as it ensures health care professionals remain informed of recent evidence and research relating to their clinical practice. However, the particular characteristics detrimental to the successful implementation of EBP within Allied Health Professionals' (AHP) clinical practice are unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess and characterise adoption of EBP within AHP's clinical practice. Methods: Questionnaires comprising the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ; Upton and Upton, 2006a ) were administered to 154 (response rate=273%) newly qualified practitioners (NQPs) from NHSScotland. Data were analysed to determine attitudes, knowledge and skill of EBP; K-means cluster and chi-square analyses were conducted in order to differentiate profiles of NPQs within high-, medium-and low-categories on the EBPQ practice and knowledge/skills sub-sections. Findings: Moderate scores were recorded for NQP's implementation, knowledge, and attitudes toward EBP. Chi-square analysis performed on the high-, moderate-and low-practice and skills' profiles revealed no significant results for NQP's year qualified, age, or year of clinical practice. Conclusions: The findings illustrate that the majority of NQPs have a good understanding of the application and importance of EPB, and suggests the improvement in NQPs training with regards to EBP enables them to successfully transfer acquired knowledge within their clinical practice.",
