  "title": "A time‐dependent effect of PDGF‐BB on adhesion and growth of cultured fibroblasts to root surfaces",
  "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB) is suggested to be a potent stimulator and a strong mitogenic agent for human periodontal ligament cells (PDL). This study aimed at assessing the effectiveness of PDGF-BB application on periodontally diseased root surfaces through attachment and growth of fibroblast cells.Fifteen periodontally involved and five healthy teeth were selected, prepared from proximal surfaces and distributed into four groups (10 specimens per group): I: healthy; II: untreated diseased; III: scaling and root planning (SRP); and IV: SRP and PDGF-BB. Each group had three subdivisions (three specimens per group) which were incubated at three different time periods. The remaining specimen for each group was used to examine surface topography. Fibroblasts were pooled on root specimens and incubated. Results were evaluated by using scanning electron microscopy. Repeated cell counting was done within a representative standard area.The best results regarding PDL cell shape and density were obtained at day 3 in all experimental groups, except the diseased group. Although SRP samples showed slightly higher results in numbers of attached fibroblasts than diseased samples, they demonstrated a similar negative effect denoting incompatible root surfaces for fibroblast attachment. SRP plus PDGF-BB and healthy samples showed a comparable positive effect, suggesting a good root surface biocompatibility. Inter-group differences showed no significant differences on day 1, but statistically significant differences were found on both day 3 and day 7 incubation periods favoring groups I and IV over groups II and III.Platelet-derived growth factor showed a positive effect on adhesion and growth of cultured fibroblasts to periodontally diseased surfaces. Thus, PDGF-BB may have a promising role in clinical periodontics.",
