  "abstract": "Carcinoid tumoursSir, The recent article by Janmohamed and Bloom provides an excellent overview of current methods of investigating and treating carcinoid syndrome (CS).' Octreotide is effective and has revolutionised the management of CS but a small number of patients do not respond to this treatment and in others refractory disease may develop.In these cases some alternative treatment is required.Meta-iodo- benzylguanidine (MIBG) has been used in the investigation and treatment of phaeochromocytoma and although mentioned only briefly in their review, has been shown to be therapeutic in CS.25 Taal and colleagues demonstrated a 60% improvement in symp- toms with both MIBG and 1311-MIBG, although a longer-term benefit was noted with the latter formulation.2Similar improvement and disease stabilisation was demonstrated by Bestagno and colleagues in four of six cases treated with '3'I-MIBG.3In a further study comparing 'salvage' therapy in CS, greater clinical efficacy was demonstrated in the subjects treated with 131I-MIBG than with chemotherapy.4In view of the distressing symptoms asso- ciated with refractory CS, we would suggest that 131I-MIBG should be considered as a useful treatment option for this condition.",
