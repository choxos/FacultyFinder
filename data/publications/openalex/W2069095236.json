  "title": "Letters to the Editor: Methodologic Issues in Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses",
  "abstract": "Reply: Doctor Handoll and colleagues suggest that we may have misled the readership of Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research when we informed them of published research indicating that systematic reviews in orthopaedics and Cochrane Collaboration reviews in general have much to gain in methodologic quality.1 We are not aware of new research comparing recently published Cochrane reviews with other systematic reviews related to orthopaedics. However, we are impressed by the Cochrane reviewers’ efforts to critically appraise and continue to improve the quality of their reviews. We also acknowledge a key valuable feature of Cochrane reviews—that they can be updated as new evidence emerges. As Cochrane reviewers, we are very familiar with the Collaboration’s commitment to high quality review methods and careful interpretation of primary research. We also are aware of the pivotal role that the Musculoskeletal Review Group has played in getting the Collaboration to its current state. We lament if our statement alone has a negative impact on the extent to which orthopaedic surgeons will use Cochrane reviews to guide their practice. We agree with Handoll and colleagues that there is plenty of room to improve the quality and clinical utility of Cochrane reviews. Victor M. Montori, MD, MSc Marc F. Swiontkowski, MD Deborah J.
