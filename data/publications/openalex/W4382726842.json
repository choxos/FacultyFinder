  "title": "The Taller Tree of Liff",
  "abstract": "Every once 1n a while, a book comes along which has such universal appeal that anyone who has ever read it will light up at tts mere mention, and endlessly quote meaningless bits to those who haven't.I have owned one such publication for more than 20 years and my copy has a faded orange sticker on the cover that modestly claims \"This book will change your life\".Unfortunately, what you hold tn your hand 1s not that particular book-it zs, however, a salute to it (or a blatant rip-off).I don't know if 1t changed my life but The Meaning of Liffby Douglas Adams and John Lloyd together with its sequel The Deeper Meaning of Laff provided me (and numerous others) with entertaining definitions to \"common experiences, feelings, situations and even objects which we all know and recognise, but for which no words exist\".The problem 1s there are also uncommon things for which a definition would come in handy.By nature plant taxonomists are rather obsessed with names and descriptive words, and Brendan Lepschi has seen that we could do with a helpful dictionary of our own.Sure, Stearn's Botanical Latin I hope The Taller Tree of Laff will also inspire esteem and affection among the few of us in the know.If you don't find this book funny then maybe you need to get out in the field more.You will soon appreciate that you now have new words to mutter under your breath when a jo/dora comes along while you're struggling with the bo/bits bastardia that you finally managed to collect and are desperately trying to press in your near-useless borrowed yermo.Kelly Shepherd, Western Australian Herbartum",
