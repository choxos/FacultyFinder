  "title": "Abstract 5488: The potential of spermine analogue SBP-101 (diethyl dihydroxyhomospermine) as a polyamine metabolism modulator in ovarian cancer",
  "abstract": "Abstract The naturally occurring polyamines, putrescine, spermidine and spermine, are polycationic alkylamines that are essential for cellular growth and proliferation. As such, many cancers are reliant on elevated polyamine levels that are maintained through dysregulated polyamine metabolism. Polyamine metabolism is thus a promising target for cancer therapeutics, and modulation of polyamine metabolism has been attempted with numerous enzyme inhibitors and polyamine analogues. SBP-101 (diethyl dihydroxyhomospermine) is a novel spermine analogue that has shown efficacy in slowing pancreatic tumor progression both in vitro and in vivo. Here we determined the effect of SBP-101 treatment on polyamine metabolism in a variety of cancer cell types in vitro including lung, ovarian, prostate, pancreatic and breast. We evaluated the activity of four enzymes involved in the polyamine pathway following treatment with either SBP-101 or the well-characterized spermine analogue, BENSpm (N1,N11-bisethylnorspermine). Additionally, we determined by high performance liquid chromatography the effect of SBP-101 on intracellular polyamine pools and the accumulation of the analogue itself. The activity of the biosynthetic enzymes ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase and the catabolic enzymes spermidine/spermine-N-(1)-acetyltransferase and spermine oxidase were determined with and without treatment with the polyamine analogues. SBP-101 treatment resulted in a varying increase in the activity of polyamine catabolic enzymes in a subset of tested cell lines, while it downregulated the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme ODC across all cell types studied. These results indicate that SBP-101 likely exerts its effect predominately through decreased polyamine biosynthesis with minor upregulation of catabolism in contrast to the structurally similar BENSpm where the increase in polyamine catabolism is the predominant response. A sustained elevation of polyamine levels plays a role in the immunosuppressive environment of some cold tumors, and the pharmacologic and genetic modulation of polyamine metabolism has demonstrated success in reducing immunosuppressive phenotypes. Therefore, to extend our in vitro results, we evaluated the efficacy of SBP-101 in the immunosuppressive VDID8+ murine ovarian cancer model. SBP-101 caused a marked increase in median survival comparable to that of some promising combination therapies. Future studies will determine the synergistic effects, if any, of SBP-101 in combination with other polyamine metabolism modulators as well as with immune modulators. Citation Format: Cassandra E.
