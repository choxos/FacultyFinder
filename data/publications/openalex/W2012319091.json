Herein we evaluate the responsiveness of this scale compared to objective measures of uroflowmetry pattern and post-void residual urine volume (PVR) in children enrolled in a prospective randomized study. METHODS Data before and after biofeedback for 61 children diagnosed with dysfunctional voiding (strictly including patients with EMG activity during voiding phase of flow curve) was extracted. Enrolment, evaluation and intervention were conducted based on protocol and standardized to include DVSS score, uroflowmetry, and PVR before and after biofeedback. RESULTS Within the study there were 18 boys and 43 girls with a mean age of 10.5 years. Twenty five (40%) of patients had a history of urinary tract infections, and 33 patients (54%) complained of incontinence prior to therapy. In comparison with those patients that did not show improvement, patients following biofeedback that displayed a normal bell shaped uroflowmetry curve had a significant decrease in their DVSS (−3.45, P=0.001). Similarly, children with normal PVR (<20 ml, ICCS criteria) after biofeedback also displayed a significantly lower DVSS (−3.26, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest that within a randomized trial the DVSS score is responsive to improvement as documented by objective measures of uroflowmetry and PVR parameters. These significant findings help validate the expanded use of this scale in this patient population, and provide further support of its value as a research tool for studies addressing children with dysfunctional voiding. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 185Issue 4SApril 2011Page: e331 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Bryce Weber Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Joao Luiz Pippi Salle Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Angela Buffett Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Sharon Guger Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Bruno Leslie Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Luis Braga Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Darius Bagli Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Walid Farhat Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Armando Lorenzo Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
