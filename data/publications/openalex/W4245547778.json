  "title": "Eradication therapy for peptic ulcer disease in Helicobacter pylori positive patients",
  "abstract": "Background Peptic ulcer disease is the cause for dyspepsia in about 10% of patients. 95% of duodenal and 70% of gastric ulcers are associated with Helicobacter pylori. Eradication of H. pylori reduces the relapse rate of ulcers but the magnitude of this effect is uncertain. Objectives The primary outcomes were the proportion of peptic ulcers healed initially and proportion of patients free from relapse following successful healing. Eradication therapy was compared to placebo or pharmacological therapies in H. pylori positive patients. Secondary aims included symptom relief and adverse effects. Search methods Trials were identified by searching MEDLINE (1950 to August 2010), EMBASE (1980 to 2010 week 35), and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (Issue 2, 2010). Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were handsearched to identify further relevant trials. Published abstracts from conference proceedings from the United European Gastroenterology Week (published in Gut) and Digestive Disease Week (published in Gastroenterology) were handsearched. The search was updated in September 2003, November 2004, November 2005, July 2008, and August 2010. Members of the Cochrane UGPD Group, and experts in the field were contacted and asked to provide details of outstanding clinical trials and any relevant unpublished materials Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials of short and long‚Äêterm treatment of peptic ulcer disease in H. pylori positive adults were analysed. Patients received at least one week of H pylori eradication compared with ulcer healing drug, placebo or not treatment. Trials were included if they reported assessment from two weeks onwards. Data collection and analysis Data were collected on ulcer healing, recurrence, relief of symptoms and adverse effects. Main results Sixty four trials were eligible. Data extraction was not possible in seven trials, and 57 trials were included. In duodenal ulcer healing, eradication therapy was superior to ulcer healing drug (UHD) (34 trials, 3910 patients, relative risk (RR) of ulcer persisting = 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.58 to 0.76) and no treatment (two trials, 207 patients, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.53). In gastric ulcer healing, no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and UHD (15 trials, 1974 patients, RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.68). In preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence no significant differences were detected between eradication therapy and maintenance therapy with UHD (four trials, 319 patients, RR of ulcer recurring 0.73; 95% CI 0.42 to 1.25), but eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (27 trials 2509 patients, RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.26). In preventing gastric ulcer recurrence, eradication therapy was superior to no treatment (12 trials, 1476 patients, RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.45). Authors' conclusions A one to two weeks course of H. pylori eradication therapy is an effective treatment for H. pylori positive peptic ulcer disease.",
