  "title": "Molecular Characterization of the 50- and 57-kDa Subunits of the Bovine Vacuolar Proton Pump",
  "abstract": "The vacuolar type proton-translocating ATPase of clathrin-coated vesicles is composed of two large domains: an extramembranous catalytic sector and a transmembranous proton channel. In addition, two polypeptides of 50 and 57 kDa have been found to co-purify with the pump. These proteins, termed SFD (sub-fifty-eight-kDa dimer) activate ATPase activity of the enzyme and couple ATPase activity to proton flow (Xie, X.-S., Crider, B.P., Ma, Y.-M., and Stone, D. K. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 28509-25815). It has also been reported that the clathrin-coated vesicle proton pump contains AP50, a 50-kDa component of the AP-2 complex responsible for the assembly of clathrin-coated pits, and that AP50 is essential for function of the proton pump (Liu, Q., Feng, Y., and Forgac, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 31592-31597). We demonstrate through the use of anti-AP50 antibody, identical to that of the latter study, that hydroxylapatite chromatography removes AP50 from impure proton pump preparations and that purified proton pump, devoid of AP50, is fully functional. To determine the true molecular identity of SFD, both the 50- and 57-kDa polypeptides were directly sequenced. A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy was used to screen a bovine brain cDNA library, yielding independent full-length clones (SFD-4A and SFD-21); these were identical in their open reading frames and encoded a protein with a predicted mass of 54,187 Da. The SFD-21 clone was then used in a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-based strategy to isolate a related, but distinct, transcript present in bovine brain mRNA. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of this isolate are identical to SFD-21 except that the isolate contains a 54-base pair insert in the open reading frame, resulting in a protein with a predicted mass of 55,933 Da. Both clones had 16% identity to VMA13 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. No sequence homology between the SFD clones and AP50 was detectable. Anti-peptide antibodies were generated against an epitope common to the two proteins and to the unique 18-amino acid insert of the larger protein. The former reacted with both components of native SFD, whereas the latter reacted only with the 57-kDa component. We term the 57- and 50-kDa polypeptides SFDalpha and SFDbeta, respectively.",
