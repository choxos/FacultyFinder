  "title": "Improving the properties of polypropylene–wood flour composites by utilization of maleated adhesion promoters",
  "abstract": "Abstract Polymer composites filled with natural organic fillers have gained a significant interest during the last few years, because of several advantages they can offer compared with properties of inorganic-mineral fillers. However, these composites (based, in most cases, on polyolefins) often show a reduction in some mechanical properties. This is mainly due to the problems regarding dispersion of the polar filler particles in the non-polar polymer matrix and their interfacial adhesion with polymer chains. In this work, polypropylene–wood flour composites were prepared and the effect of the addition of a maleated polypropylene was investigated. The two materials were compounded by an industrial co-rotating twin screw extruder, with two different compositions, without and with addition of Licomont AR504® (maleic anhydride-grafted polypropylene wax). The extruded material was then compression molded, which provided the specimens for tensile and impact tests. Water uptake was measured; the morphology of the fracture surfaces of the samples coming out from mechanical tests was investigated through SEM analysis. Rheological characterization was carried out as well. The addition of the adhesion promoter allowed a decrease in water uptake; mechanical properties were improved as well, especially elastic modulus and tensile strength; impact strength increased in the case of unnotched samples, while notched ones did not show remarkable differences. SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces also showed an overall change in the morphology as a consequence of the utilization of the adhesion promoter.
