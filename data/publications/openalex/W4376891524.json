Davis P.G. Roberts R.S. Timing of caffeine therapy in very low birth weight infants.J Pediatr. 2014; 164: 957-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar Postmenstrual ages at discontinuation of caffeine therapy should vary according to the gestational age of the infant and the observed clinical resolution of immature breathing patterns. Any application of positive airway pressure to prevent or treat apnea should be stopped first because it is more invasive than oral caffeine therapy. Although many clinicians use a 5-to-7-day monitoring period without apnea after cessation of caffeine therapy as a prerequisite for discharge, the \"specific event-free period may need to be individualized … depending on the gestational age at birth and the nature and severity of recorded events\".25Eichenwald E.C.

Caffeine has reliable enteral absorption, is administered only once per day, and therapeutic drug monitoring is unnecessary if standard doses are prescribed.12Aranda J.V. Beharry K.D.

Caffeine citrate is an essential respiratory stimulant for infants with apnea of prematurity. When used for this indication, standard doses of caffeine are effective and safe into middle school age. Further rigorous research studies are required to close existing evidence gaps. Pending the results of such future investigations, clinical guideline developers should not venture beyond the currently available best evidence. Policy makers should ensure that all preterm infants with apnea have access to safely manufactured and affordable caffeine citrate.",
