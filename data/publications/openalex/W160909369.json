A total of 30 New Zealand white rabbits (2 groups of 15) underwent creation of distal hypospadias. In the control group ventrally placed skin flaps were created and sutured to the urethra. In the experimental group the ventrally placed skin flaps were welded to the urethra using a continuous wave diode laser (808 plus or minus 1nm., 6.25 watts per cm.2). The welded anastomoses were strengthened by applying a solder of fibrinogen combined with a laser energy-absorbing dye. No stents were left indwelling. Operative time using laser welding was considerably less than that with sutured repair. No fistulas were seen in the welded urethras, and no significant foreign body reaction was identified in the laser welded repairs. Hypospadias repair in the rabbit using the laser welding technique seems to be a feasible alternative to suture repair. Topical energy-absorbing dyes that enhance thermosetting solders further increase weld strength while reducing collateral thermal damage to target tissues. © 1992 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited by (2018) EDITORIAL COMMENTJournal of Urology, VOL. 166, NO. 3, (1016-1017), Online publication date: 1-Sep-2001.KIRSCH A, COOPER C, GATTI J, SCHERZ H, CANNING D, ZDERIC S and SNYDER H (2018) LASER TISSUE SOLDERING FOR HYPOSPADIAS REPAIR:: RESULTS OF A CONTROLLED PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIALJournal of Urology, VOL. 165, NO. 2, (574-577), Online publication date: 1-Feb-2001.Kirsch A, Chang D, Kayton M, Newhouse J, Libutti S, Treat M, Connor J and Hensle T (2018) Sutureless Rabbit Bladder Mucosa Patch Graft Urethroplasty Using Diode Laser And SolderJournal of Urology, VOL. 153, NO. 4, (1303-1307), Online publication date: 1-Apr-1995.Kirsch A, Dean G, Oz M, Libutti S, Treat M, Nowygrod R and Hensle T (2018) Preliminary Results of Laser Tissue Welding in Extra Vesical Reimplantation of the UretersJournal of Urology, VOL. 151, NO. 2, (514-517), Online publication date: 1-Feb-1994.
