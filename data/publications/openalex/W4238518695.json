  "title": "The A.J. Ladman AAA/Wiley exemplary service award",
  "abstract": "The A.J. Ladman AAA/Wiley Exemplary Service Award is jointly presented by the American Association of Anatomists and John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Publishers. This award is presented to a member who has distinguished himself/herself in the field of anatomy and who has provided exemplary service to the Association. The recipient of this award for 1999 is Dr. George E. “Erik” Erikson, who is currently President of the Erikson Biographical Institute, Inc. Dr. Erikson has had a long and fruitful career in anatomy beginning with his appointment as Instructor of Anatomy (1947–1949) at Harvard Medical School. He has been a member of the AAA for many years, having attended his first meeting in 1952, and has served as Historian and Archivist (1972–1988 and since 1990) and Archivist (1988–1990) of this Association. Dr. Erikson is a man of great enthusiasm for anatomy and its practitioners and he has an abiding interest in and appreciation of the many important historical events that have taken place in this century and before. His collecting of biographical information on anatomists, begun informally more than half a century ago, has evolved into the Erikson Biographical Institute, Inc. This is a totally unique resource of biographical data on literally hundreds of thousands of scientists and scholars. In this endeavor Dr. Erikson has worked closely with professional organizations, honorary and honorific societies, numerous colleges and universities, and award-granting bodies to build his Biographic Institute database. Dr. Erikson received his S.B. (Scientia Bacculaureus) in 1941 from Massachusetts State College (now the University of Massachusetts). He entered graduate school at Harvard and received his A.M. degree in Biology in 1946. During his master's program he was a Teaching Fellow (1942–1946) and Austin Teaching Fellow (1944–1945), both in Biology, and he was a Reader in History of Science and Learning at Harvard with the dean of Historians of Science, Professor George Sarton. He also held a position as a Teaching Fellow in Anatomy from 1945 to 1947. In 1945, during his master's program, Dr. Erikson became a Proctor at Harvard University (continuing until 1950) and a member of the Board of Freshmen Advisors (continuing until 1952). Immediately after receiving his A.M. degree, Dr. Erikson continued his graduate work in Biology at Harvard University under the direction of the eminent paleontologist Professor Alfred S. Romer. During this period he conducted field studies on Central American primates as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow (1946) and was also a Jeffries Wyman Scholar (1946–1947). He received his Ph.D. degree in Biology from Harvard in 1948 for research on primate anatomy carried out in Dr. George Wislocki's Department of Anatomy. At about this time, Dr. Erikson combined his command of anatomy and the pleasure of sharing it into a lifelong career of teaching anatomy in a wide variety of venues. While he was an Instructor of Anatomy (1947–1949) at Harvard he began to teach anatomy at the Lahey Clinic (1947–1960) and at the Massachusetts General Hospital School of Medical Education (1947–1960). From 1949 to 1952 he held the positions Assistant Professor of General Education in Biology and Research Fellow in Anatomy at the Medical School. He was an Associate in Anatomy (1952–1955) and was later appointed Assistant Professor of Anatomy (1955–1965), both at Harvard. During this latter time Dr. Erikson expanded even further his contributions to medical education. He served as a Consultant in Medicine and Public Health in Brazil for the Rockefeller Foundation (1959) and as a Specialist for the State Department on advanced inter-university instruction at the University of Sao Paulo (1962), and he was Associate Curator at the Warren Anatomical Museum (1961–1965) and Lecturer on Anthropology (1965). Dr. Erikson's career underwent an important change when in 1965 he became the founding Chairman and Professor of Medical Science in the newly formed Division of Biology and Medicine at Brown University. Only three years later (1968) he was appointed Chairman of the Section of Morphology of this division, serving in this capacity until 1985. From 1985 to 1989 he was Co-Chairman of the Section of Population Biology, Morphology and Genetics and he was Co-Chairman for Anatomy from 1989 to 1990. Dr. Erikson became Professor Emeritus at Brown in 1990, continuing to teach variously and to do research and administer at the Erikson Biographical Institute. During this 1965–1990 time frame, Dr. Erikson also continued his varied educational contributions to the field of anatomy as defined broadly. He taught courses on the relationship of science and anatomy to art at the Rhode Island School of Design (since 1970) and provided anatomical instruction to the Department of Neurosurgery (since 1987) and the Department of Orthopedic Surgery (since 1985). He was also a Visiting Professor in the Department of Anatomy and Cellular Biology at Harvard in 1989–1990. Since his formal retirement in 1990, Dr. Erikson has continued his participation as a Lecturer/Anatomist. He gives lectures in the Department of Surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital (since 1990) and co-teaches a course on surgical anatomy to fourth-year medical students at Harvard (since 1990). Dr. Erikson has also made a number of contributions that extend considerably beyond his extensive instructional experiences. For example, he was the anatomy consultant for the book Surgical Techniques Illustrated (1976–1980) and since 1987 he has been the anatomy consultant for Dorlands Illustrated Medical Dictionary. He is also a member of the Board of Advisors for Marquis Who's Who in America. Over the years, Dr. Erikson has been a member of 14 professional organizations and he has been honored on a number of occasions. These organizations include, but are not limited to, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Association for the History of Medicine, the AAA, the American Association of Physical Anthropologists, the History of Science Society, the Anatomical Society of Great Britain and Ireland, the Cajal Club, and Sigma Xi. Dr. Erikson was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1949 and he was elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Medical Society at Harvard Medical School in 1957. He was the Kate Hurd Mead Lecturer at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia in 1977 and was the Seventh Raymond C. Truex Distinguished Lecturer at Hahnemann University School of Medicine in 1985. Dr. Erikson has an outstanding command of the field of Anatomy. His ability to integrate information and to present it in an interesting and relevant format has been widely recognized, and greatly appreciated, by his numerous students over the years. He has also been particularly devoted to students and young professionals and to under-represented minorities. Many members of the AAA have fond memories of Dr. Erikson at our annual meetings, indulging in his love of history and things historical. Collecting biographical information, taking photographs at almost every event (many of these have graced the pages of the AAA Newsletter and appear on our web page), and manning the Historian-Archivist's booth are but a few of the services Dr. Erikson has given the AAA. Everyone who has visited his booth has been enriched by the tremendous historical detail of persons, places and events that have made our Association great and by his range of analytical surveys of the membership. He also has generously contributed photographs to past pages of The New Anatomist in order to celebrate anatomists of renown. The AAA is pleased to honor Erik Erikson as the 1999 recipient of the A.J. Ladman AAA/Wiley Exemplary Service Award. G.E. “Erik” Erikson. Photograph by Suzanne Erickson, Harvard Medical School, 1990.
