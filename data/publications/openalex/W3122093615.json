  "title": "Poverty and Survival",
  "abstract": "Abstract Abstract A recent literature highlights the uncertainty concerning whether economic growth has any causal protective effect on health and survival. But equal rates of growth often deliver unequal rates of poverty reduction and absolute deprivation is more clearly relevant. Using state-level panel data for India, we contribute the first estimates of the impact of changes in poverty on infant survival. We identify a significant within-state relationship which persists conditional upon state income, indicating the size of survival gains from redistribution in favour of households below the poverty line. The poverty elasticity declines over time after 1981. It is invariant to controlling for income inequality but diminished upon controlling for education, fertility and state health expenditure, and eliminated once we introduce controls for omitted trends. Acknowledgements I would like to thank Andrew Newell for encouraging me to write this article. The article has benefited from the comments of the editor, Richard Palmer-Jones and two anonymous referees. Notes 1. This ranking was apparent unconditional on poverty. Conditioning on a variable does have the potential to reverse a ranking but in this case, as it happens, it does not to do this. In the pooled regressions, these levels differences are captured by state fixed effects. 2. If we conduct this simulation using a one s.d. change estimated on the within-state variation in log poverty (which is 0.21), the predicted decline in mortality is 2 percentage points. This is a fifth of the mean and 43 per cent of the s.d. of mortality in the sample. 3. In that paper I regressed state health expenditure on state income, a lagged dependent variable (instrumented with two further lags), year and state dummies and state-specific trends. 4. In an alternative exercise conducted on these data, we estimate the rate of income growth that India would need to have in order to lower child mortality to the level implied by the Millennium Development Goal (Bhalotra, 2008b Bhalotra, S. 2008b. \"Childhood mortality and economic growth in India\". In Achieving the Millennium Development Goals, Edited by: McGillivray, M. Basingstoke, UK: Palgrave-McMillan & the United Nations University–WIDER. Chapter 6 [Google Scholar]). 5. Amongst babies born in 1970–1975, the percentage with uneducated mothers and fathers was 75 and 45, respectively, and the percentage with mothers and fathers with secondary or higher education was 1.3 and 11.7. By 1990–1998, the percentage of uneducated parents had fallen to 60 and 35 and the percentage with higher education had risen to 8.6 and 20. The overall sample mean of rural mothers' years of education is 1.93, the overall standard deviation (s.d.) is 1.46 and the within-state s.d. is 0.69. 6. The baseline specification is that in column 2 of Table 2a. Including the 1970s births, the 1970s poverty coefficient is 0.036. It is 0.022 in the 1980s and 0.019 in the 1990s. The income coefficients by decade are −0.047, −0.042, −0.041. These decade differences are all statistically significant. Dropping the 1970s births, the poverty and income coefficients for 1980 and 1990 are insignificantly different from one another. 7. What we can say is that the elasticity lies somewhere within the rather wide range produced by within-groups estimates with and without these controls.",
