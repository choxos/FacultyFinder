  "title": "Thermoregulatory behaviour of gravid and non‐gravid female grass snakes (<i>Natrix natrix</i>) in a thermally limiting high‐latitude environment",
  "abstract": "Abstract All else being equal, ectotherms should maintain body temperatures ( T b s) favourable for temperature‐sensitive biological functions, such as digestion and locomotion. Physical environments in the temperate zone are often thermally variable, however, thus making it difficult to maintain optimum T b s. Radiotelemetry and a semi‐natural enclosure were used to monitor T b s of grass snakes Natrix natrix at Canterbury, Kent, U.K. Operative temperatures ( T e s) were measured using snake models (copper‐pipe models) placed in a variety of microhabitats to determine availability of thermoregulatory opportunities. A modification of Huey &amp; Slatkin's (1976) regression model, piecewise regression, was used to evaluate thermoregulatory behaviour. Grass snakes could achieve high mean T b s (&gt; 30°C) most often during midday (08:00–20:00), but only for 55–61% of the study period. Overall, non‐gravid snakes maintained higher and less variable mean daytime T b s than gravid snakes. From piecewise regression, it was determined that grass snakes initiated thermoregulation at a T e of 38.44 °C, corresponding to a T b of 27.7 °C. Three main conclusions can be drawn from this study: (1) thermoregulatory opportunities for grass snakes were limited; (2) nonetheless, when conditions were sufficiently warm, there was clear evidence that grass snakes could thermoregulate; (3) contrary to expectation, gravid females actually maintained lower and more variable T b s than non‐gravid females. The consequences of these thermoregulatory patterns for the fitness of snakes have yet to be determined.",
