  "abstract": "Special Issue-Bathymetry from Space constant f/H, where f is the Coriolis parameter and H represents ocean depth.Barotropic theory is often supported by observations.For example, floats in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans preferentially spread along f/H contours rather than across them, indicating that flow responds to topography (LaCasce, 2000).In reality, because the ocean is stratified, and velocities tend to be faster near the ocean surface than at middepth, flow does not literally follow contours of f/H.Gille (2003) used float data to examine whether Southern Ocean velocities could be assumed to be equivalent barotropic, meaning that velocities attenuate with depth, with a fixed e-folding scale, H o (Killworth, 1992).Thus velocity v(z) = v(0) exp(-z/H o ).Under this assumption, flow is predicted to follow contours of f/F o , where Marshall, 1995;Krupitsky et al., 1996).In the limit where the e-folding scale, H o , is infinite, this is equivalent to assuming that flow follows f/H contours.Since only large-scale topographic features of the sea floor are expected to steer large-scale circulation, topography was smoothed to eliminate variations with length scales less than 100 to 200 km.As illustrated in Figure 2, Gille (2003) found that in the Southern Ocean the equivalent barotropic model explains the largest fraction of variance in the flow data when an e-folding depth of about 700 m is assumed.This is consistent with other analyses of the Southern Ocean that have suggested that velocities decrease with e-folding scales between 500 and 1000 m, depending on position within the ACC and computation method (e.g., Karsten and Marshall, 2002).Research using the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Layered Ocean Model (NLOM) has shown the influence of abyssal layer flow on the upper ocean in numerical simulations.Hurlburt and Metzger (1998) demonstrated how topographically steered mean abyssal currents can steer upper ocean currents as the Kuroshio Extension bifurcates in the vicinity of the Shatsky Rise (158°E, 33°N).Surface currents can bend",
