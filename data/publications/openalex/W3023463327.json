Variability in surgical decision making and reported complication rates in hypospadias surgery warrants further study to improve care delivery outcomes. Barriers to collaboration include small patient number, single institution efforts, and variability in patient assessment and reporting. Our goal was to create a document that could be shared across institutions, standardizing the documentation process. METHODS: A review of currently existing hypospadias scoring systems, data collection forms from existing registries (INSPIRE, HOLD) and expert opinion identified various datapoints for documentation. Expert feedback was obtained to determine necessary elements for surgical billing, a complete operative note and data elements for hypospadias reporting. Collaboration with an electronic health record (EHR) vendor established reportable data elements. A standardized clinical documentation form was created for preoperative measurements, intra-operative details and post-operative follow-up was created. RESULTS: An EHR standardized document was created for both documentation and research purposes (Figure 1). The operative note includes the type of repair, the planned intervention, type of anesthesia. The initial operative assessment includes the location of the urethral meatus, associated scrotal anomalies, the presence and degree of penile curvature, and the quality of the urethral plate. Specifics for orthoplasty, glansplasty, and urethroplasty are captured. Further granular details such as suture utilization, use of barrier layers, and duration of stent placement amongst others are also included, if the user elects to utilize them. The follow up note includes both functional and cosmetic assessment, reporting complications in a standardized fashion. CONCLUSIONS: This template standardizes the documentation of both intraoperative and follow up patients with hypospadias; it serves the dual purpose of clinical documentation and quality reporting. Furthermore, this will facilitate collaboration across institutions to improve the quality of the urologic literature. We present this work to foster broad utilization across centers.
