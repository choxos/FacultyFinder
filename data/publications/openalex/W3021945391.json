  "title": "Screen-time during the after-school period: A contextual perspective",
  "abstract": "Sedentary screen-time is an increasingly prevalent behaviour, associated with a range of adverse health outcomes. Sedentary time and screen-use increase during adolescence, making this age group a prime target for behaviour change interventions. Better understanding the context in which sedentary screen-behaviours occur is important for ensuring future interventions have maximum impact. This study aimed to describe the prevalence of adolescents' sedentary screen-time in the after-school and weekday evening periods, and to examine associations between contextual factors (location within the home and who they were with) and after-school/evening screen-time. Time that UK adolescents (N = 204, aged 11 or 12 years, 61.4% girls) spent using various screens was measured using a detailed three-day time-use diary completed at home. Adolescents reported the start and end time for each screen-based activity, where they were, and who they were with. Weekday (Monday-Friday) data were analysed with a focus on the after-school (3–6 pm) and evening periods (6–10.45 pm). Young adolescents spend around a third of their weekday evening leisure-time using screens, with boys engaging in slightly more screen-use than girls. The majority of after-school and weekday evening time at home was spent with family or siblings, with less than 1% spent with friends. Adolescents who spent more time alone after school reported greater screen-use. Greater time spent at home, in the lounge (living room) or bedroom was associated with greater screen-use. These findings highlight the value of devising family-based health-promotion interventions which target after-school/leisure-time screen-use in an effort to reduce young adolescents' sedentary recreational screen-time behaviours.",
