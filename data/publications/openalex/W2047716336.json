  "title": "The Use of Rib Histomorphometry as an Aid in the Personal Identification of Unknown Skeletons",
  "abstract": "In 1982, construction of a courthouse at Kamloops, B.C. disturbed the skeletal remains of three individuals thought to represent men convicted of murder, who were hanged and buried within the grounds of a provincial gaol which stood on this site at the turn of the century. Archival records indicate that during this time 17 men were executed by hanging at Kamloops. Only 6 of these men are known to have been buried within the confines of the gaol, while 4 others are suspected interments.This paper presents the results of a histomorphometric analysis of 6th rib cortical bone sections as one avenue explored in the personal identification of these three skeletons. The analysis involves the examination of the time- and age-dependent variability of microscopic bone remodeling processes (Haversian remodeling) and aims to corroborate other lines of evidence—bone and tooth macromorphology and historical documents—which are traditionally used in such endeavors. For two cases the method provided greater discrimination among a set of possible identities than that obtained through the more traditional approaches alone, and for one case was able to corroborate the identity suggested by the prior traditional analysis. It is concluded that the analysis of rib cortical bone histology is a valuable adjunct to the techniques commonly employed by forensic anthropologists, particularly for younger age groups, and has a useful role to play in the forensic sciences.",
