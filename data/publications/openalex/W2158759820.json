  "title": "Perceived parent-child relationships and early adolescents' orientation toward peers.",
  "abstract": "This study examined the links between children's perceptions of the manner in which they and their parents adjust their relationships during early adolescence and early adolescents' orientation toward parents and peers. A sample of 1,771 children completed self-report questionnaires during the spring of their 6th and 7th grades. As predicted, early adolescents who believed their parents asserted and did not relax their power and restrictiveness were higher in an extreme form of peer orientation. Also as predicted, those who perceived few opportunities to be involved in decision making, as well as no increase in these opportunities, were higher in both extreme peer orientation and peer advice seeking. Discussion focuses on the importance for parent-child relationships to adjust to early adolescents' changing developmental needs, as well as the implications of early adolescent peer orientation for later development. As a transitional period in children's development, early adolescence represents a time of significant changes in children's relationships with both their peers and their parents. Children have increased unsupervised contact with peers and begin to place greater importance on their approval, views, and advice (Brown, 1990). At the same time, they spend less time with their parents and appear to distance themselves emotionally from them (Collins & Russell, 1991; Larson & Richards, 1991). These simultaneous processes seem to be important components of the negotiation of the power balance and authority in parent-child relationships that takes place during adolescence (Steinberg, 1990; Youniss, 1980). For most early adolescents, parent-child relationships need to begin providing greater mutuality and more opportunities for adolescents' participation in decision making (Baumrind, 1991). While many families likely make these adjustments successfully, others may not. The manner in which families handle this transitional period should have important implications for the roles parents and peers play",
