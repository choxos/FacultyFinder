  "abstract": "It is certainly a mark of great wisdom to the organizer of this meeting to have chosen Charles Phillips as our Guest Lecturer for this meeting. Whilst I am grateful for this opportunity of saying a few words of introduction, I am sure it can be said of Charles Phillips that very little introduction is necessary, since we meet him at the most important meetings in Neurophysiology around the world. Any meeting on the motor system, of course, is not complete without the participation of Dr. Phillips. However, some of the less old-timers than myself, and the students, might be interested in the beginnings of Dr. Phillips’ career in neurophysiology and to know that he was first a clinical neurologist beginning his medical studies in Oxford just before the war, where he came under the influence of Sir Charles Sherrington with Jack Eccles as his tutor.",
