  "abstract": "The paper presents the thesis that experienced physicians, while diagnosing routine cases, are operating upon knowledge structures that are distinctively different from those of novice physicians and students. In the course of their medical training, students develop rich, elaborated causal networks, explaining the causes and consequences of disease in terms of general underlying pathophysiological processes. Through extensive and repeated application of knowledge and exposure to patient problems, the network type of knowledge organization is replaced by list-like structures called illness scripts. As these scripts are verified through experience they become instance scripts. Finally, the various knowledge structures develop through a sedimentation process into multiple layers which are accessed when ontologically more recently acquired structures fail to adequately represent a clinical problem. Research evidence for each of these stages and types of knowledge structure is summarized. Contains 20 references.
