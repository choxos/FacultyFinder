  "title": "Evaluation of a Secure Messaging System in the Care of Children With Medical Complexity: Mixed Methods Study (Preprint)",
  "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> The Connecting2gether (C2) platform is a web and mobile–based information-sharing tool that aims to improve care for children with medical complexity and their families. A key feature of C2 is secure messaging, which enables parental caregivers (PCs) to communicate with their child’s care team members (CTMs) in a timely manner. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The objectives of this study were to (1) evaluate the use of a secure messaging system, (2) examine and compare the content of messages to email and phone calls, and (3) explore PCs’ and CTMs’ perceptions and experiences using secure messaging as a method of communication. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> This is a substudy of a larger feasibility evaluation of the C2 platform. PCs of children with medical complexity were recruited from a tertiary-level complex care program to use the C2 platform for 6 months. PCs could invite CTMs involved in their child’s care to register on the platform. Messages were extracted from C2, and phone and email data were extracted from electronic medical records. Quantitative data from the use of C2 were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Messaging content codes were iteratively developed through a review of the C2 messages and phone and email communication. Semistructured interviews were completed with PCs and CTMs. Communication and interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> A total of 36 PCs and 66 CTMs registered on the C2 platform. A total of 1861 messages were sent on C2, with PCs and nurse practitioners sending a median of 30 and 74 messages, respectively. Of all the C2 messages, 85.45% (1257/1471) were responded to within 24 hours. Email and phone calls focused primarily on clinical concerns and medications, whereas C2 messaging focused more on parent education, proactive check-ins, and nonmedical aspects of the child’s life. Four themes emerged from the platform user interviews related to C2 messaging: (1) connection to the care team, (2) efficient communication, (3) clinical uses of secure messaging, and (4) barriers to use. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Overall, our study provides valuable insight into the benefits of secure messaging in the care of children with medical complexity. Secure messaging provided the opportunity for continued family teaching, proactive check-ins from health care providers, and casual conversations about family and child life, which contributed to PCs feeling an improved sense of connection with their child’s health care team. Secure messaging can be a beneficial additional communication method to improve communication between PCs and their care team, reducing the associated burden of care coordination and ultimately enhancing the experience of care delivery. Future directions include the evaluation of secure messaging when integrated into electronic medical records, as this has the potential to work well with CTM workflow, reduce redundancy, and allow for new features of secure messaging. </sec>",
