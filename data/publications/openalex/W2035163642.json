  "title": "CONSENSUS OR CONFUSION: CARTOGRAPHERS' KNOWLEDGE OF GENERALIZATION",
  "abstract": "Cartographers' knowledge of cartographic generalization must be captured and compared in order to understand the process and to make this knowledge available for use in cartographic expert systems. The interactive knowledge elicitation program, KSSO, was used to elicit this knowledge from 23 cartographers. The elicitations provided insights into each subject's understanding of generalization, and a comparison of the responses of a subgroup of these subjects revealed areas of agreement and disagreement in the concepts these cartographers held regarding generalization and its procedures. There is a lack of standardization among the entire group with regards to their definitions of generalization procedures. As well, there are major areas of disagreement and little agreement among the conceptual systems of a subgroup of these experts with regards to six common generalization procedures. This lack of consensus about generalization can be a serious impediment to the successful implementation of knowledge-based systems for automated generalization. Further research is necessary into how cartographers understand generalization, and the terminology of generalization should be standardized and the concepts underlying generalization need to be clarified by the cartographic community.",
