  "title": "Habitat Monitoring with Sensor Networks",
  "abstract": "M ONITORING WITH S ENSOR N ETWORKS By Robert Szewczyk, Eric Osterweil, Joseph Polastre, Michael Hamilton, Alan Mainwaring, and Deborah Estrin These networks deliver to ecologists data on localized environmental conditions at the scale of individual organisms to help settle large-scale land-use issues affecting animals, plants, and people. istorically, the study of micro- climate and habitat utilization have been largely observa- tional, with climatic and behavioral variables being extrapolated from a few or even individual measurement sites. Today, densely deployed sensor networks are being scaled to the size of the organisms under study, sampling phenomena at fre- quencies the organisms encounter, and dispersed in patterns that capture the full range of environmen- tal exposures to provide the fine-grain information needed for accurate modeling and prediction. Ranging in size from tens to potentially thousands of nodes within a habitat patch, these networks are beginning to provide a view of often subtle changes in a given landscape at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The technological challenges for developing and deploying them are daunting. They must be unobtrusive yet durable under a range of environmental stresses, including damage caused by the organisms themselves. They must be so energy efficient that they can remain in situ with little human interaction and be maintenance-free for years at a time. They must also reliably interconnect with a cyber infrastructure that permits frequent network H ABITAT H access for data upload, device programming, and management. Here, we survey the components of a complete habitat-monitoring system, from miniature data-collection sensor nodes to data-processing back- ends containing millions of observations, showing how they fit into a unified architecture, deriving our data and conclusions from several case studies (see the sidebar “Sensing the Natural Environment”). Few themes permeate basic and applied ecological research to such an extent as the relationship of microclimate and ecological patterns, processes, physiology, and biological diversity. Microclimate can be defined as the climate close to surfaces, upon and beneath soils, under snow, or in water, on living things (such as trees), or even on individual animals. Individuals may disperse across broad areas, but per- sistence, growth, and reproduction depend on the existence of narrow ranges of key environmental con- ditions that vary over narrow spatial gradients. For example, we see only the stand of trees that reached the right microclimate as seeds but not the tens of thousands of seeds that perished or simply failed to take root because they germinated in areas outside the range of their tolerance. Through their presence and activity, organisms alter their surroundings in important ways.
