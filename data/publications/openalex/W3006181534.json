  "title": "Abstract P3-11-03: Pilot neoadjuvant study of niraparib in <i>HER2</i>-negative, <i>BRCA</i>-mutated resectable breast cancer",
  "abstract": "Abstract Background: Niraparib is a selective poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 inhibitor that has demonstrated antitumor activity in advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in combination with a programmed cell death 1 inhibitor, with the greatest clinical activity seen in tumors with breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations. Pharmacologically, niraparib has demonstrated a wide volume of distribution and high cell membrane permeability. In breast and ovarian cancer xenograft mouse models, niraparib achieved tumor exposures that were 3.3 times greater than plasma exposure. The objective of this study is to evaluate the antitumor activity of single-agent niraparib in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with localized, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, BRCA-mutated breast cancer. The relative concentration of niraparib in tumor versus plasma was also assessed. Methods: Eligible patients were ≥18 years old, with HER2-negative, BRCA-mutated (germline or somatic) resectable breast cancer with a tumor size of ≥1 cm who had not received prior treatment for the current malignancy. Patients received niraparib 200 mg once daily for 2 months. At the end of 2 months, at their treating physician’s discretion, patients proceeded directly to surgery, received additional cycles of niraparib (maximum of 6 months), or received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary endpoint was tumor response rate measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 months of treatment. Response was defined as a ≥30% reduction in tumor volume from baseline. Secondary endpoints included tumor response rate measured by ultrasound, quantified percent change in tumor volume measured by MRI or ultrasound, pathological complete response, and safety and tolerability. Additionally, niraparib concentrations were measured in tumor and plasma samples using qualified liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Results: Twenty-one patients were enrolled. As of June 2019, 18 patients had both an MRI and ultrasound scan at the end of month 2 and were evaluable for response. Ten patients are currently on treatment. The median age of patients was 43 years (range, 21-73). Fourteen patients had a BRCA1 mutation, 6 patients had a BRCA2 mutation, and 1 patient had both. Fifteen patients had TNBC, and 6 patients had hormone receptor-positive disease. All 18 response-evaluable patients had a clinical response after 2 months of treatment by at least one imaging modality; no patient experienced disease progression. Tumor response rate measured by MRI after 2 months of treatment was 89% (n/N = 16/18). Results measured by ultrasound were similar, with a 94% response rate at cycle 2 (n/N = 17/18). The median percent decrease in tumor volume after 2 months of treatment was 88% (range, 26-100%) and 89% (range, 23-100%) as measured by MRI and ultrasound, respectively. In the 5 samples measured thus far, niraparib concentrations in tumor biopsies after 2 months of treatment ranged from approximately 4-131-fold higher than those in corresponding plasma samples. Efficacy and tumor concentration data for all patients will be presented at the meeting. The most common (≥10%) drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of any grade were nausea, fatigue, anemia, insomnia, and decreased appetite. The only drug-related grade ≥3 toxicity in ≥10% of patients was anemia (3 patients). Three patients had a dose reduction due to a TEAE; no patient discontinued treatment due to a TEAE. Conclusion: Niraparib was well tolerated and showed promising antitumor activity in the neoadjuvant treatment of patients with localized HER2-negative, BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Niraparib achieved 4-131-fold higher concentrations in tumor than in plasma. Clinical trial information: NCT03329937. Funding: TESARO: A GSK Company (Waltham, MA, USA) sponsored the study.
