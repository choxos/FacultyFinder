  "title": "Measurement Issues in the Design of State Accountability Systems.",
  "abstract": "The practices, policies, and procedures used in all 50 states for evaluating school and school district effectiveness were examined, with a focus on the study of methodological and measurement issues in the collection, analysis, and reporting of information for accountability purposes. Data were collected through computerized literature and Web searches and by analyzing existing reports and documents. Most states are now engaged in the development of new assessment and accountability systems that can measure student, school, and district performance. Forty-eight states require some form of student testing, and many states are revamping existing testing systems and instruments, usually with an emphasis on criterion-referenced or standards-based instruments. A number of states have passed, or are considering, legislation providing monetary incentives for high-performing schools and sanctions for low-performing schools. If the current accountability movement is to be successful, more careful attention to the design and development of accountability systems will be needed. (Contains 54 references.)
