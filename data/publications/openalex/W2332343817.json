  "abstract": "By ELIZABETH PENNISI A bout 150 years ago, artist and naturalist John James Audubon trekked across the American landscape, cataloging the wildlife he encountered and capturing its beauty on canvas. Now a computer is transforming his work, as well as the field observations of countless other biologists, into a much different kind of imagery: complex maps that lay the groundwork for conservationists' attempts to practice preventive medicine. The basic assumption is that the time to protect a species is when it's common, says J. Michael Scott, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist based at the University of Idaho in Moscow. History shows that many now-rare plants and animals were common 50, even 20 years ago. Some were so numerous that people considered them pests. But once a plant or animal's numbers dwindle, preventing its extinction can become a very expensive and sometimes losingbattle, Scott explains.",
