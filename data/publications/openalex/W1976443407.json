  "abstract": "A comparison of the combination of antacids and cimetidine with antacids alone (suggested by your leading article) has already been reported in the treatment of patients with established acute mucosal bleeding.8Haemostasis was achieved earlier with cimetidine but it is noteworthy that bleeding stopped within 48 hours in only 330N) of either treatment group.This fact-that established acute gastrointestinal haemorrhage may be difficult to control-and the disastrous results of surgical intervention in the few patients in whom medical treatment is unsuccessful contradict your final sanguine conclusion that \"treatment may reasonably be reserved for those in whom bleeding occurs.\"It is true that prophylaxis should be reserved for high-risk patients-those with severe burns, head injuries or multiple injuries, and major operations, especially when these conditions are complicated by hypotension, jaundice, sepsis, renal failure, or severe respiratory insufficiency.Cimetidine infused slowly intravenously has fewer side effects than antacids, may be used even when the gut is not functioning, and is more convenient.For the most effective prophylaxis intragastric pH should be maintained above 4 and antacids may occasionally need to be added to cimetidine to achieve this.",
