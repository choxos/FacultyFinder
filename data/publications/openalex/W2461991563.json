  "abstract": "1. Donald H. Arnold, MD, FAAP*\n\n\n \n\n1. *Assistant Professor, Departments of Emergency Medicine and Pediatrics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN\n\nSharon is a 16-year-old adolescent well known to you since you became her pediatrician in early childhood. Sunday morning at 3 am you receive an urgent call from the emergency department at your community hospital where she presented after collapsing while dancing at a local “rave” party. You are informed that she is agitated, confused, and disoriented; has a high fever; and is having seizures. The emergency department physician has administered intravenous lorazepam and rectal acetaminophen and requests your presence immediately.\n\nYou arrive at the emergency department as quickly as possible. The physician who called you notes that the seizure activity diminished after two doses of lorazepam, but he is preparing to administer fosphenytoin because she continues to jerk her arms and legs. You obtain a brief history from her parents, who arrived several minutes before you.\n\nThe parents remind you that Sharon has been treated with sertraline 150 mg/d for generalized anxiety disorder. They state that she has been otherwise happy, healthy, and on no other medications. She recently obtained her driving permit and was allowed to go out with several friends earlier in the evening.\n\nSharon’s vital signs are: temperature, 106.7°F (41.5°C); heart rate, 145 beats/min; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; blood pressure, 162/96 mm Hg; and Sao2, 99%. She is agitated and diaphoretic. There are coarse, nonpurposeful jerking motions and hypertonia of the extremities. The pupils are equal and reactive, and there are no asymmetric or localizing neurologic abnormalities.\n\nAt this moment, determining a unifying process that would explain the abrupt onset of altered mental status, the extreme hyperthermia and other vital sign abnormalities, and the myoclonic seizurelike activity and hypertonia is a tremendous challenge. Your differential diagnosis includes toxic ingestion, infectious encephalitis, and closed-head trauma.\n\nSharon’s boyfriend has been waiting in the triage area, …",
