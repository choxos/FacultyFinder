We sought to examine data from a prenatal HN cohort to identify those with POM, in order to determine their fUTI, surgical intervention and spontaneous resolution rates. METHODS POM pts were consecutively sampled from 2008-14 in a prospective fashion. Only those who had a VCUG to rule out VUR were included. Six a priori variables were studied: HN grade [low(I,II) vs. high(III,IV)], continuous antibiotic prophylaxis (CAP) use, gender, circumcision status, ureteral dilation (≥12mm) and tortuosity. fUTI was defined as a >100000 CFU/ml positive culture from a catheterized urine sample, with a fever ≥38°C. Univariate and multivariable analyses (cox proportional regression) for fUTI risk factors were carried out. Resolution trends by surgery and ureteral dilation were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests. RESULTS Mean and median pt age at 1st clinic visit were 3.4±3.9 and 2 mos (0-21). Median follow-up time was 2 years (6-60 mos). Overall, 21 of 72 infants (29%) developed a fUTI at a median age of 3 (mean=6;1-24) mos. The majority were males (n=64, 89%), and 21 (33%) were circumcised. High-grade HN was present in 63 (87%) pts and CAP was prescribed for 31 (43%). Univariate analysis is displayed in table 1. Cox regression identified uncircumcised males (HR=5.7, p=0.01) and lack of CAP (HR=5.9, p=0.01) as independent risk factors for fUTI. HN grade, ureteral diameter and tortuosity were not associated with higher fUTI rates. Pts who underwent surgery (n=17, 20%) had a larger mean ureteral diameter vs. those treated conservatively (18±12 vs. 11±3mm, p<0.01). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that only 30% of surgical pts had resolution of their HN by 36 mos vs. 60% of those whose POM was managed conservatively (p=0.04). CONCLUSIONS Most POM infants developed fUTIs within the first 3 months of life. Circumcision and use of CAP significantly reduced fUTI rates in those pts. Ureteral diameter ≥12mm was significantly associated with a higher operation rate, but not with increased UTI rates as one would expect. Resolution of HN after tapered ureteral reimplantation may take longer than 3 years. Table 1.
