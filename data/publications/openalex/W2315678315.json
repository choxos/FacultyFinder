  "title": "Rationale and modifications for implementing parent-child interaction therapy with rural Appalachian parents.",
  "abstract": "This article describes the rationale and modifications for implementing parent-child interaction therapy (PCIT) with rural Appalachian parents. (PCIT) is an intervention designed for parents with children ages two through six who exhibit emotional and behavioral issues. PCIT differs from other behavioral programs in that both the child and parent are directly involved in treatment, parents are coached in their use of parenting skills directly during session, and homework assignments are given to build upon gains made in session. PCIT first seeks to rebuild the parent-child relationship through the development of a secure attachment and then integrates discipline to decrease behavioral problems and increase positive child behaviors. This is done through the use of two separate segments: Child-directed interaction (CDI), which aims to increase parental praise, reflection, description, and imitation of child behaviors, and enthusiasm, with the goal of forming a secure attachment between the child and parent, and parent-directed interaction (PDI), in which child behavioral problems are addressed by providing parents with the education and skills (e.g., time-out) necessary to increase child compliance and decrease problem behaviors. Topics discussed include (1) barriers to treatment, (2) externalizing child behavior problems, (3) behavioral parent training programs, (4) cultural modifications to PCIT, (5) alignment of PCIT with Appalachian culture, (6) and Appalachian cultural modifications to PCIT.
