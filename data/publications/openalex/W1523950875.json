  "abstract": "Introduction: With the health professional's better alertness to the benefits of breastfeeding, the rates of discontinuation show some discrete signs of improvement. Objective: To determine the prevalence of breastfeeding during the first six months of life within the pediatric population served by the Barão do Corvo Primary Care Center, and analyze its relation with age, parity, social-economic backgrounds, maternal profession and education, experience in breastfeeding, level of information and advice and health professional's practices. Methods: An inquiry was applied to the mothers of infants from 6 to12 months old brought to that primary care unit during the month of March 2003. Results: We obtained 91 questionnaires (15% of the target population). On the day of discharge from maternity 98% of mothers were breastfeeding; 56% in the first month of life (the higher rate of weaning) and 34% in the sixth month. The frequency of the reasons why breastfeeding was interrupted was determined. The introduction of formula was indicated by the pediatrician in 39% of the cases. Factors like first time mother, adolescent mother, no experience in breastfeeding, lower education, and having received bottle supplementation in the maternity, relates negatively with the duration of breastfeeding. Conclusion: The prevalence of breastfeeding at birth is excellent, but at six months is far away from OMS goals, of 50% babies' exclusively breastfed by this age. The identification of risk factors for early termination of breastfeeding allows the implementation of public health interventions aimed at improving the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first 4 to 6 months of babies' life.",
