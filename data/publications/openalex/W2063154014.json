  "title": "Britain, France, and America's Year of Europe, 1973",
  "abstract": "Abstract Britain's entry into the European Community in 1973 coincided with an American initiative aimed at redefining relations between the United States and Western Europe. This confronted British diplomats with a serious dilemma. They wished to maintain close collaboration with Washington and, for the sake of European unity, to expand on their recently achieved reconciliation with France, a country whose Gaullist elite rejected any further institutionalization of transatlantic relations. French reluctance to engage in a constructive dialogue with the Americans resulted in a fractious debate over the drafting of two seemingly innocuous declarations, and this was exacerbated by the mixed response of the Europeans to the outbreak of the fourth Arab–Israeli war and the ensuing energy crisis. Finally, at the Washington energy conference of February 1974, the British chose to work with the Americans, rather than the French, in seeking to mitigate the economic impact of OPEC's oil policies. Notes *This article is based very largely upon documents reproduced on CR-ROM in Documents on British Policy Overseas, Series III, Vol. IV, The Year of Europe: America, Europe and the Energy Crisis, 1972–1974 (London: Whitehall History Publishing/Routledge, 2006). The relevant documents are footnoted as DBPO3, iv. The opinions expressed in the article are the author's own and should not be taken as an expression of official Government policy. 1.

Heath later commented on the exercise: \"For Henry Kissinger to announce a Year of Europe without consulting any of us was rather like my standing between the lions in Trafalgar Square and announcing that we were embarking on a year to save America!.\" Edward Heath, The Course of My Life: My Autobiography (London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1999), p. 493. This, however, overlooked the fact that, according to Kissinger, even if the European powers had not been consulted, the French, the Italians and the West Germans, had, like the British, all been informed of the speech's content prior to its delivery.

Indeed, according to Kissinger, on this occasion Jobert left him under the impression \"that in the end he would not only go along but take the lead in shaping an outcome consonant with our objectives,\" provided he was \"permitted to play the leading role and that we not use the Year of Europe to isolate France within the Community.\" Kissinger, Years of Upheaval, pp. 164–5. 29.

Nixon suspended further work on an EC/U.S. declaration following the Nine's decision on 4 March 1974 to proceed with a Euro-Arab dialogue culminating with a meeting of Arab foreign ministers.

But at a diplomatic level there was disappointment over the EC's failure to agree on the establishment of a regional development fund and the lack of progress towards economic and monetary union. 102.
