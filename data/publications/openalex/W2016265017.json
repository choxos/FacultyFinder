  "abstract": "Now that the principles and practice of evidence-based medicine (EBM) have become the cornerstone of clinical practice, there appears to be a mounting backlash both in peer-reviewed articles1–,4 and in the medical popular press.5–,6 A common criticism is that evidence cannot be applied to individual situations since each patient is unique. Related to this is the concern that the systematic search and appraisal of the evidence and its application to individual patients take the “art out of clinical practice”. EBM is often seen as simply a “cookbook approach to solving clinical problems”. In this editorial, I will argue that this criticism is a caricature of both evidence-based medicine and of artistic endeavour and is logically inconsistent. Moreover, I will make the point that the only ethical practice in child psychiatry is one that uses the principles of evidence-based medicine.\n\nFor most of its history, child psychiatric practice was based on theories of child development as articulated by Freud, Erikson, Baldwin, and others. Starting with a conception of “normal” child development, there was an attempt to show how deviations from healthy child development became associated with psychopathology and how understanding these deviations could be used to devise treatment strategies. These strategies often involved working with the child alone, with the parent alone, or with some combination (family therapy). Clinical decisions based on theories of child development represented hypothetical accounts used to predict future events, in this case, response to treatment. There was no appreciation that hypothetical accounts need to be empirically tested. This is analogous to the situation in clinical medicine where findings from “normal” physiology were used to develop treatments that could be applied to patients with a particular disease. The paradigm shift associated with evidence-based medicine …",
