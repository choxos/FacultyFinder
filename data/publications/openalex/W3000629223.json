  "title": "Perceived Impact of Virtual Scenario-Based Branching Simulations Among Radiology Program Students",
  "abstract": "The influx of medical technology and medical knowledge creates challenges for healthcare providers in maintaining up to date knowledge and skills for their practice. Healthcare educators are further challenged in that the goal is to encourage learners to become competent healthcare providers who are knowledgeable and skilled, self-directed, and who will think critically and ethically when faced with challenging situations. Advancing imaging technologies and new complex procedures in radiology increase the risk of harm for patients and providers as advanced imaging is often learned outside of a primary degree in radiology with real patients through on the job training. Online education has been a way for the profession to extend needed education to working technologists, however, radiology education programs need ways to improve the level of learning in online advanced modality courses. This study explored an innovative teaching method to identify which will aid in current and future demands in radiology. Based on a review of the literature on scenarios, simulations, and virtual learning environments, virtual scenario-based branching simulations were designed, built, and implemented for this study. The virtual 2D role-playing scenario in which the student played the role of a new technologist in an advanced imaging suite provided students an opportunity for experiential learning online. The branching design, in which the patient and storyline evolves with the learnerâ€™s decisions required the learner to think critically and draw upon previous knowledge to make decisions about what should be done. This changed the direction of the stories and the outcomes of the virtual patients and personnel. The simulations were designed to enhance the level of learning in magnetic resonance imaging and in computed tomography online courses. They were tested with 57 advanced modality students to determine the impact the virtual scenario-based branching design had on student satisfaction with the experience and also their perceived confidence in making critical decisions in real practice.",
