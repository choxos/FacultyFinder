  "title": "Reply: A Systematic Review of Surgical Randomized Controlled Trials",
  "abstract": "Sir: We would like to thank Al-Taha and colleagues for their letter on behalf of the Canadian Plastic Surgery Research Collaborative regarding our systematic review.1,2 We appreciate the opportunity from the Editor to discuss this topic. Al-Taha et al. highlight the benefits of a trainee-led research collaborative, summarize the general workflow of the Canadian Plastic Surgery Research Collaborative, and encourage the adoption of a multicenter trainee-led research model in other specialties and countries. We have read with great interest about the emergence of trainee-led surgical research collaboratives over the past 10 years, involving the majority of surgical specialties in the United Kingdom. These collaboratives have been ambitious and productive, connecting a large number of medical students and trainees, recruiting a considerable number of patients, and demonstrating a respectable quality of research.3 Beyond providing high-level research evidence, the process of multicenter trial planning and execution itself can change “evidence culture.” By forming a network of opinion leaders and researchers, multicenter trials foster collaboration and cohesion among involved specialists, improve their acceptance and application of evidence, and create opportunities to facilitate an integrative research environment.4 The success and trajectory of the United Kingdom collaboratives suggest this research model can be effective in surgical research. The West Midlands Research Collaborative, one of the more established and productive United Kingdom groups, has provided guidance for the management of a trainee-led collaborative.5 An important difference between North American and United Kingdom trainee-led collaboratives relates to the length of surgical residency training, which typically is limited to only 5 or 6 years in North America. Thus, we believe that of the eight fundamental principles of managing a research collaborative5 the ability to “retain active trainee-level leadership so that committee members build experience, learn skills, share responsibility, encourage participation, support new and longstanding members” is likely to play a major role in the long-term success of this research model in North America. Furthermore, in our experience, we have noted that centers excelling in research are generally led by experienced, motivated, and committed principal investigators, who are able to achieve broad and high-level consultant engagement. This trainee-led collaborative research model has the potential to engage trainees in research, a learning experience through which one can acquire practical skills relevant to a career in surgery. Participation in these groups can help trainees acquire the ability to interpret study results, evaluate a study’s quality, and apply the relevant evidence in clinical practice to improve patient care. We support our colleagues representing the Canadian Plastic Surgery Research Collaborative and the high-quality research other plastic surgery research collaboratives have undertaken.
