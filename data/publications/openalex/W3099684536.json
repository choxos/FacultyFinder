In particular, data informing the public on whether there is an evidence-based rationale to modify the use of these chronic medications during the pandemic are necessary. We studied whether preadmission exposure to PPIs or H2RAs was associated with worse outcomes among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. This was a secondary analysis of a retrospective cohort study aiming to better characterize digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 36 medical centers in North America.8Elmunzer B.J. et al.Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol. 2020 Sep 30; (PMID: 33010411)Google Scholar The first 50 to 100 consecutive patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 at each participating institution were included. Clinical data from the time of symptom onset until discharge, death, or the end of the study period were manually abstracted from electronic health records by study personnel under the oversight of a primary clinician-investigator. Conventional regression and propensity score matched analyses were performed to evaluate the association between preadmission acid suppressive medication exposure and mechanical ventilation or death. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the validity of excluding patients with unknown PPI/H2RA status and of imputing missing data. More comprehensive methods are provided in the Supplementary Material. Between April 15 and June 5, 2020, data were collected from 1992 subjects. There were 146 patients excluded from the primary analysis because PPI or H2RA use within 1 month of admission was unknown. Characteristics of the final study cohort (1846 patients with COVID-19) are shown in the Supplementary Table 1. A total of 417 patients (22.6%) had recent PPI use, 167 (9.1%) had recent H2RA use, and 29 (1.6%) had both. The baseline variables included in the final regression models are listed in Supplementary Table 2. After adjusting for measured baseline confounders, PPI use was not independently associated with the need for mechanical ventilation in the primary regression analysis (odds ratio [OR] 1.02; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.73–1.43; P = .89) (Figure 1). In contrast, H2RA use was associated with 1.55 times the odds of requiring mechanical ventilation relative to patients not exposed to H2RA (OR 1.55; 95% CI 1.11–2.19; P = .01) (Figure 1). Propensity score matched analysis confirmed the lack of association between PPI use and mechanical ventilation and demonstrated a significant increase in the likelihood of mechanical ventilation among patients exposed to H2RA (risk difference 9.72%; 95% CI 1.26%–18.2%; P = .02). In sensitivity analyses, removal of patients with at least 1 missing covariate value (480 observations) or inclusion of patients with unknown PPI/H2RA use (139 additional observations) did not change the findings. PPI use was not independently associated with increased death (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.66–1.14; P = .31) (Figure 1). Similarly, H2RA exposure was not associated with increased death (OR 1.37; 95% CI 0.96–1.95; P = .08) (Figure 1). Propensity score matched analysis showed similar findings. In the sensitivity analyses, removal of patients with at least 1 missing covariate value (375 observations) did not change the findings pertaining to PPI use. However, this analysis did demonstrate a statistically significant association between H2RA exposure and in-hospital mortality (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.04–2.12; P = .03). The sensitivity analysis that included patients with unknown PPI/H2RA status (139 additional observations) did not change the results. In this large-scale study of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 across 36 medical centers in North America, preadmission exposure to PPI and/or H2RA did not appear to strongly affect the likelihood of mechanical ventilation or death. Our findings do not support the putative deleterious effects of PPIs and in fact contradict the hypothesized benefits of H2RAs in SARS-CoV-2 infection. These observations suggest that modified use of these medications for the purpose of improving COVID-19 outcomes is not justified. Instead, the results reinforce the preexisting guidance of taking acid suppressive medications only when indicated and at the lowest dose that achieves the clinical objective for which they were recommended. The observation that preadmission H2RA use increased the risk of mechanical ventilation in this cohort is noteworthy, as it opposes growing evidence of the beneficial effect of famotidine. The reasons for this finding are unclear and may not apply to famotidine specifically, as the exact H2RA consumed by patients in the cohort was not determined. However, since the estimated effect size was relatively small, there was no association between H2RA use and death, and residual confounding is always a risk in observational studies of this nature, the finding largely serves to caution against overuse of this medication and highlights the importance of additional research prior to clinical care or policy changes. It is also important to emphasize that recent studies showing the favorable effect of famotidine have evaluated active treatment rather than preadmission exposure, as we assessed in this study. This study has several important limitations. First, PPI and H2RA exposure was not verified against pharmacy records and their consistent use could not be confirmed. However, these medications are commonly acquired over the counter, limiting the ability of prescription claims to confirm use. Furthermore, medication use in this study was collected manually by comprehensive review of electronic health records by clinicians or study coordinators under the oversight of a clinician-investigator, with likely increased accuracy compared with administrative data. Second, as noted previously, we did not specifically query the use of famotidine relative to the other H2RAs, and thus a beneficial effect of this medication may have been diluted by other drugs in this class. Third, we did not collect data on in-hospital acid suppressive medication administration, which may have been associated with preadmission exposure and could have confounded the analysis. Last, observations from this cohort reflect the earliest phase of the pandemic and may not apply to the current time. In conclusion, we did not observe a strong deleterious effect of preadmission PPI use or a beneficial effect of preadmission H2RA use among patients hospitalized with COVID-19. These findings caution against the modified use of these medications to improve COVID-19–related outcomes.

The study was conducted through an alliance of 36 medical centers in the United States and Canada. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each site before patient identification and data collection. Adult patients who were hospitalized with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 were considered eligible. To limit sampling bias, we aimed to include the first 50 to 100 consecutive patients meeting eligibility criteria at each participating institution. Potentially eligible patients were identified by site investigators using multiple methods, including data warehouse queries, electronic research subject identification tools, and COVID-19 patient lists provided by relevant hospital entities. Clinical data from the time of symptom onset until discharge, death, or the end of the study period, including the use of PPI or H2RA within 1 month of admission, were manually abstracted through review of electronic health records. Data abstraction was performed by clinical research coordinators, medical students, internal medicine and gastroenterology trainees, as well as faculty gastroenterologists, depending on site. Every site had a designated clinician investigator who oversaw and vouched for the integrity of data collection. Data quality was ensured to the greatest extent possible using a multifaceted strategy that has been described previously and included manual review of all incoming data by a dedicated data management specialist.1Almario C.V. et al.Am J Gastroenterol. 2020; 115: 1707-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar The data collection form is provided later in this Supplementary Material. The association between acid suppressive medication use and mechanical ventilation or death was evaluated using 2 separate multivariable generalized linear regression models. PPI and H2RA use, the independent variables of interest, as well as age, race, and sex were included in both models. Lasso regression, an agnostic, data-driven approach to variable selection, was used to select the other covariates. Only laboratory values at admission were included as covariates in the models because in-hospital laboratory values (highest/lowest) could have occurred after mechanical ventilation (a primary outcome) and could have been confounded by in-hospital treatments. To account for clustering by center, generalized estimating equation models with a random center effect were used. To assess the validity of findings from the primary regression analysis, we performed a propensity score matched analysis of the association between PPI or H2RA use with mechanical ventilation or death. Propensity scores were estimated for PPI or H2RA use based on the predicted probability of exposure, estimated from generalized linear mixed models with either PPI/H2RA use as the outcome and all other patient factors (excluding mechanical ventilation and death) as predictors. A random center effect was used in this model as well. Four-to-one control-to-treatment caliper matching with caliper = 0.2 was applied to the propensity scores to obtain matched patients by H2RA or PPI use. Missing data were assumed to be missing at random and were imputed before model development. In the primary analysis, we excluded patients whose PPI and/or H2RA use within 1 month of admission was unknown. Sensitivity analyses were subsequently conducted to evaluate the validity of excluding patients with unknown PPI/H2RA status and of imputation.Supplementary Table 1Patient CharacteristicsPatient CharacteristicOverall (N = 1846)Demographics Age, y, mean (SD)59.9 (16.4) Sex, male, n (%)1044 (56.6) Race, n (%)White680 (36.8)Black774 (41.9)Other/Unknown392 (21.2) Body mass index, mean (SD)31.5 (8.14) PPI use, Yes, n (%)417 (22.6) H2 blocker use, Yes, n (%)167 (9.1)Patient health characteristics Comorbidities, Yes, n (%)Hypertension1146 (62.1)Coronary artery disease/myocardial infarction284 (15.4)Congestive heart failure194 (10.5)COPD171 (9.26)Asthma240 (13.0)Obstructive sleep apnea197 (10.7)Peripheral vascular disease91 (4.93)Cerebrovascular accident or TIA170 (9.21)Dementia118 (6.39)Diabetes Mellitus658 (35.6)ESRD175 (9.48)Current malignancy117 (6.34)Prior malignancy171 (9.26)Digestive disease183 (9.91)Other comorbidities829 (44.9)No comorbidities203 (11.0) No. Comorbidities, median (min-max; IQR)2 (0-10; 3) Chemotherapy or Immunosuppression, n (%)Yes219 (11.9)No1621 (87.8)Unknown6 (0.33) Current or recent ACE or ARB use, Yes, n (%)556 (30.1) Current or recent NSAID use, n (%)Yes506 (27.4)No1100 (59.6)Unknown240 (13.0) Current or recent antibiotic use, n (%)Yes560 (30.3)No1251 (67.8)Unknown35 (1.90)Admission clinical lab measures White blood cell count, mean (SD)7.18 (4.00) Hemoglobin, mean (SD)12.9 (2.20) Platelets. mean (SD)207.5 (90.3) Aspartate, mean (SD)50.7 (54.1) Alanine aminotransferase, mean (SD)37.5 (34.5) Alkaline phosphate, mean (SD)82.3 (48.8) Bilirubin, mean (SD)0.64 (0.63) Albumin, mean (SD)3.63 (0.52) Creatinine, mean (SD)1.65 (2.76)Outcomes Mechanical ventilation required, Yes, n (%)584 (31.6) ICU admission, Yes, n (%)795 (43.1) In-hospital death, Yes, n (%)327 (17.7) HLOS, days, median (min-max, IQR)8 (0.4-113; 13)ACE, angiotensin-converting enzyme; ARB, angiotensin receptor blocker; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; ESRD, end-stage renal disease; HLOS, hospital length of stay; ICU, intensive care unit; IQR, interquartile range; NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; TIA, transient ischemic attack.
