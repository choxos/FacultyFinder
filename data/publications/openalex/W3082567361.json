  "title": "FRI0576 IDENTIFICATION OF SERUM PROTEIN BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH RA DISEASE SEVERITY",
  "abstract": "Background: RA is a systemic autoimmune disease with heterogeneous manifestation. Recent advances in serum proteomics, such as the SomaScan ® platform (SomaLogic, Inc., Boulder, USA), allow for a deeper exploration of the protein biomarkers associated with RA and a better understanding of the molecular aetiology of the disease. Objectives: To characterise the differences in baseline serum proteome of patients with RA (enrolled in the Phase IIIb Abatacept vs adaliMumab com P arison in bioLogic-naïv E RA subjects with background MTX [AMPLE] study) 1 compared with a healthy population, and to identify serum protein biomarkers associated with disease severity and radiographic progression. Methods: Patients in the AMPLE study had an inadequate response to MTX and were naïve to biologic DMARDs. Protein abundance was assessed in baseline serum samples from 440 AMPLE study patients and 123 healthy individuals with matching demographics using the SomaScan ® platform, with 5000+ slow off-rate modified aptamers and up to 8 log of dynamic range. 2 Differential abundance testing was performed using linear models to identify differences in protein abundance in patients with RA vs healthy individuals. A separate analysis using a linear model was conducted in only the patients with RA to identify the proteins associated with DAS28 (CRP) and TSS. Pathway analyses were performed for proteins significantly (false discovery rate-adjusted p value &lt;0.05) associated with RA and the disease severity measurements to identify over-representation of the molecular pathways. Results: Compared with healthy individuals, &gt;2000 serum proteins were significantly differentially expressed in patients with RA, including many proteins that have been associated with RA (e.g. serum amyloid A [SAA], CRP) and complement. Most of the protein expression differences were of small magnitude (fold change &lt;2). Proteins that were differentially expressed between patients with RA and healthy individuals were enriched in interleukin signalling, neutrophil degranulation, platelet activation/degranulation and extracellular matrix organisation pathways. DAS28 (CRP) was significantly associated with several biomarkers, including SAA, fibrinogen and CRP; in general, proteins associated with DAS28 (CRP) were most strongly enriched in the platelet activation/degranulation pathways (Figure 1), also seen in patients with RA vs healthy individuals. Additionally, many proteins were significantly associated with TSS, including SAA, matrix metalloproteinase-3 and cartilage acidic protein 1. Here, the proteins were most strongly enriched in the extracellular matrix remodelling pathways (Figure 2). Conclusion: Our study revealed that thousands of serum proteins are differentially expressed and several pathways are dysregulated between patients with RA and healthy individuals. Additional pathways were identified that reflect disease severity, including joint damage, distinct from those pathways associated with the disease. The SomaScan ® platform provides a unique proteomic tool with a wide dynamic range for the identification of serum protein biomarkers associated with RA and disease severity. Proteomic signatures should be considered in clinical trials to better understand disease pathogenesis and predict risk in response to treatment. References: [ 1] Schiff M, et al.
