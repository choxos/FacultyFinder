No guidance specific for procedure and patient factors exists in urology. We provide absolute risk estimates of symptomatic VTE and bleeding requiring reoperation in urological non-cancer surgery. METHODS We searched for contemporary observational studies reporting symptomatic VTE or bleeding after urological procedures. Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility, evaluated risk of bias, and extracted data. For each procedure, we used the lowest risk of bias studies and accounted for thromboprophylaxis use (relative risks from meta-analyses of RCTs) and length of follow-up (using modelling for timing of VTE and bleeding). We derived best estimates of risk from the median of available studies. Primary endpoints were 4-week post-operative incidence of symptomatic VTE and bleeding requiring reoperation. On the basis of a systematic review, we stratified patient specific risks as small (no patient risk factors), medium (age >75 years, or BMI >35, or VTE in a 1st degree relative), and large risk (any combination or personal VTE history). We used the GRADE approach to assess quality of evidence. RESULTS We included 35 studies reporting on 7 urological procedures for benign disease. Most studies (55%) were at high risk of bias due to lack of thromboprophylaxis reporting; quality was low or very low for each body of evidence. When prophylaxis was reported, duration varied widely between procedures and studies; e.g., median was 5 days (range 4-42) for laparoscopic donor kidney transplantation and 1 day (range 0-1) for reconstructive female pelvic surgery (incl. vaginal prolapse and sling surgery). Risk of VTE and bleeding were both generally low for these procedures (<2%) (Table). The highest risks were found in open recipient nephrectomy and open prolapse surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our results suggest prophylaxis is warranted in some procedures (kidney transplantation in large risk patients) and not others (reconstructive female pelvic surgery in small/medium risk patients). For some “close call” procedures, the decision will depend on values and preferences with regard to VTE and bleeding. © 2016FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 195Issue 4SApril 2016Page: e618-e619 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2016MetricsAuthor Information Kari Tikkinen More articles by this author Samantha Craigie More articles by this author Arnav Agarwal More articles by this author Rufus Cartwright More articles by this author Reed Siemieniuk More articles by this author Giacomo Novara More articles by this author Philippe Violette More articles by this author Richard Naspro More articles by this author Per Morten Sandset More articles by this author Michael Gould More articles by this author Gordon Guyatt More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
