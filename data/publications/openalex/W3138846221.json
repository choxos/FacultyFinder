  "title": "Efficacy of Ahmed Glaucoma Valve and Trabeculectomy With Mitomycin-C in Pediatric Glaucoma",
  "abstract": "Objective: To compare the efficacy between Ahmed glaucoma valve surgery and Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin-c inpediatric glaucoma.Study design and setting: Quasi-experimental study was conducted at Pediatric Ophthalmology Department, ISRA Postgraduate Institute of Ophthalmology/ Al-Ibrahim Eye Hospital, Karachi. Duration of study was February to August 2016.Methodology: Samples were divided into two groups. Group A Trabeculectomy with Mitomycin-C and Group B withAhmed Glaucoma valve surgery. Inclusion criteria were children (above 2 years and less than 15 years of age) visitingPediatric Ophthalmology OPD irrespective of gender, glaucoma diagnosed with the duration of symptoms &gt; 4 weeks.Exclusion criteria were patient with repeat surgery for glaucoma, combined ocular surgery i.e penetrating keratoplasty orcataract, Preoperative keratitis, uveitis or conjunctivitis, as determined by slit-lamp examination. Paired sample t-test wasapplied to compare the pre and post IOP examination findings. P-value = 0.05 considered as statistically significant.Results: A total of 110 patients were recruited in this study in which 97 patients were analyzed. Mean age of Group A was6.73±2.7 and mean age of Group B was 7.05±2.3. Mean pre-operative IOP in “Group A” was found to be 31.59±5.4 andpost-operative IOP was reduced to 17.95±4.8 with statistically significant P-value &lt;0.0001. In “Group B” Mean preoperativeIOP was 30.60±5.3 and post-operative IOP was 18.43±3.8 with statistically significant P-value &lt;0.0001.Conclusion: A significant difference found between efficacy of Ahmed glaucoma valve surgery and Trabeculectomy withMitomycin-C in pediatric glaucoma after 4th week of surgery.",
