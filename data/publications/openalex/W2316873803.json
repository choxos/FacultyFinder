  "abstract": "Introduction: The comorbidity measures are useful in comparing patient population in health service search, predicting inpatient mortality, health care cost etc. Amongst the two most widely used comorbidity measures, the Elixhauser's has been reported to perform better than the Charlson's in predicting short and long-term mortality. The Elixhauser comorbidity measure consists of 30 comorbidities from the international disease classification - 9 clinical modification (ICD-9CM). To improve ease in the use, a point system was derived for Elixhauser comorbidities using multiple logistic-regression to predict inpatient mortality in single center Canadian cohort. The derived index performed well in split sample validation. Methods: This retrospective observational study was performed at 300-bed community hospital catering a suburban population. All the adult patients admitted during October 2005 through September 2011 were included in the study. Our hospital uses ICD-9 CM and coding is performed by expert coders. Score allotment for the comorbidities was performed as described by Walraven et al (Med Care. 2009 Jun;47(6):626-33). Performance of the index in predicting inpatient mortality was measured using the area under the Receiver operating curve. Predicted and observed mortality were compared. Results: Total of 52,068 patients were admitted during this period. Mean age was 65.9 (SD 18.9) years, 41.4% were male and median duration of hospital stay was 3 days (IQR 2 to 5). 1037 (1.99%) patients expired in the hospital. Area under the Receiver operating curve in predicting all cause inpatient mortality was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78-0.81). The predicted and observed inpatient mortality were similar, Fisher's exact test 2-tailed p = 0.1487 Conclusions: We report excellent performance of the Elixhauser comorbidity index in prediction of inpatient mortality in an external cohort from United States.",
