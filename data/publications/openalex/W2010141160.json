  "title": "Trollope and the Terrible Meshes of the Law: Mr. Scarborough's Family",
  "abstract": "THOSE TERRIBLE MESHES OF THE LAW! exclaims Trollope. How is a fictionist, in these excited days, to create the needed biting interest without legal difficulties; and how again is he to steer his little bark clear of so many rocks ... ?' Legal difficulties, despite his affectation of timidity, are nevertheless a staple of Trollope's novels. In more than one instance, he navigated the perils by taking aboard a professional pilot, the lawyer Charles Merewether, M.P. for Northampton and writer of the famous legal opinion on the Eustace diamonds. Orley Farm, The Eustace Diamonds, Phineas Redux, and The Warden are among the more notable examples of novels built on legal difficulties, as Messrs. Chaffanbrass, Furnival, Thomas Turtle Dove, and Sir Abraham Hapihazard, Attorney General, are amiong the more outstanding ornaments of his extensive gallery of lawyers. Mr. Scarborough's",
