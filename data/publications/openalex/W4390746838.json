  "title": "Strategic Human Resource Management (SHRM) and Inclusion for promoting Workplace Creativity and Innovation: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Abstract Methodology: The study conducted a comprehensive review of research by analyzing 78 articles from reputable journals published between 2010 and 2023. Purpose: The purpose of the study was to examine how strategic human resource management (SHRM) and inclusion can promote workplace creativity and innovation among employees. Findings: The findings of the study indicate that inclusive SHRM practices should focus on various policies and practices across three main human resource practice domains: knowledge and abilities, drive and effort, and opportunities to contribute. Line managers play a crucial role in implementing inclusive SHRM practices to encourage workplace creativity and innovation. Integrating SHRM and inclusion strategies can harness the potential of diverse ideas and perspectives within the organization. Originality: The originality of the study lies in its comprehensive review of multiple articles and its focus on the integration of SHRM and inclusion strategies to promote creativity and innovation in the workplace. The study highlights the importance of HR managers, professionals, and line managers in implementing inclusive policies and practices to engage and empower the diverse workforce. It also suggests that future research should explore different aspects of SHRM's impact on organizational inclusion.",
