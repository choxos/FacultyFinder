Email: isyrafishak13@gmail.com. Abstract Prayer is the pillar of religion. It must be performed either in normal or critical situation as long as Muslims possess sane mind. Except that in critical situation, there are rukhsah (leniency) given by Islamic laws to people facing the situation. Rukhsah is a leniency or concession given to an accountable Muslim in performing Allah’s commandments during certain situation due to obstacle or any matter permitting exception from general principle. This article is posed to explain on the concept of rukhsah for prayer in facing critical situation. Methodology of this study is of qualitative research. Data were collected from document analysis by referring to history books either on history of prayer decreeing classical fiqh books, contemporary fiqh book, current fatwas, views of scholar figures, observation and interviews with Officers of Fire Department and Critical Air Traffic. Data collected were analysed and elaborated through inductive, deductive and comparative methods to gain result complying with assigned objectives. This study found that there are three critical situations in Islam which are rainfall, sickness and arising need or difficulty. There are two main methods practised by Muslim community in Malaysia while facing critical situation which are skipping prayer and then replacing it the prayer. However, there is a more accurate method according to al-Sunnah and scholars’ view which is by performing jamak for two prayers in a period due to dire and unavoidable need.",
