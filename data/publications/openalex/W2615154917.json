  "title": "The Role of Sistani People in the Uprising of IbnAsh’at against Umayyad Caliphate System (80-85 A.H.)",
  "abstract": "Encountering Muslim Arabs and Islam in the first hegira century, Sistani people showed two kinds of reaction. Many of them did not resist Islam and its divine teachings and gradually converted to this new religion; however, they stood up to the racist and oppressive dominance of Umayyad family and whenever they got an opportunity, they expressed their hatred towards them by joining anti-Umayyad uprisings. Abdolrahmanibn Mohammad ibnAsh’at was one of the anti-Umayyad uprisings. Many of Sistani people took part in this uprising. In the present study, the descriptive—analytical research method has been used and with the help of library sources, the role of Sistani people in the uprising of ibnAsh’at against the Umayyad caliphate system has been reviewed. Due to dissatisfaction of Sistani people with the oppressive Umayyad governance, Khawarij’s anti-Umayyad propaganda in Sistan region, exponential financial and bodily costs resulting from successive wars of the Umayyad governors in eastern borders with the governance of Ratabilan, the essential substrate was built for Sistani people to join ibnAsh’at’s anti-Umayyad uprising. Although this uprising failed, but it weakened the pillars of the Umayyad governance and it proceeded to the extent that Umayyad family was on the verge of being falling and it also paved the way for the anti-Umayyad uprisings subsequent to it.",
