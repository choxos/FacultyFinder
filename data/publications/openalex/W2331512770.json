Severe malaria can manifest in the lungs, an illness known as acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Using an experimental model previously established by our group we evaluated the immune cell profile and inflammatory response in malaria associated ALI/ARDS. METHODS AND RESULTS: DBA/2 mice were infected with Plasmodium berghei ANKA. Lungs and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) were collected 7 days post infection (7dpi). Using the respiratory patterns (enhanced pause and respiratory frequency) and parasitemia from a survival group, we established ROC curves and were able to classify experimental animals euthanized 7dpi as suffering ALI/ARDS or HP (hyperparasitemia). There was an increase in neutrophils, seen by increased Ncf2 mRNA expression (qRTPCR) and increased numbers of Gr-1high CD11b+ cells (flow cytometry), in the lungs of ALI/ARDS mice compared to HP mice. In the lung we observed increased numbers of alveolar macrophages (F4/80+/CD11C+) and fewer interstitial macrophages (F480+) (flow cytometry) and in the BAL we observed an increase in macrophages and neutrophils (cytospin) in the ALI/ARDS mice. We also found that mRNA expression of iCAM-1, HO-1, IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) and IFNγ (pro-inflammatory) genes was elevated (qRTPCR) in the lungs of the ALI/ARDS mice. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that neutrophils and alveolar macrophages play a role in ALI/ARDS development. We hypothesize that the neutrophil recruitment is partly dependent on increased ICAM-1 expression and that the high IL-10 mRNA expression is an attempt to re-establish homeostasis.
