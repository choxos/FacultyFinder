  "title": "Learning and assessing cultural competence in paediatrics",
  "abstract": "Context and setting Cultural competency is associated with improved health outcomes. To ensure that our students are both clinically and culturally competent, they learn cultural competency throughout their medical training. Why the idea was necessary Indigenous Maori children receive a lower standard of health care and have poorer health outcomes than other children in New Zealand. In our paediatric rotation we therefore wanted our students to learn and be assessed on cultural competency as it pertains to indigenous Maori children and their families. What was done We introduced a lecture on Maori health at the beginning of the paediatric rotation. In this the students were reminded of the poorer health outcomes of Maori children, were shown how they receive a lower standard of health care and were informed about the difficulties the children and their families encounter in accessing health services. Students submit three case reports as part of their paediatrics assessment. We required one of these to be on a Maori child and his or her family. The clinical teachers who marked the other case reports also marked the Maori cases against specific criteria. These required demonstration of: consideration of the childâ€™s health within the context of the wider determinants of health; recognition of the inequalities in health outcomes; an understanding of the family dynamics; a management plan that was consistent with the family context; a conscious effort to address the barriers to health care; a critical reflection on the interaction with the child and the family, and some indication of what the student had learned and how this might influence his or her future practice and professional development. Evaluation of results and impact To assess inter-observer variability, four examiners of different ethnic backgrounds marked the same 10 case reports on Maori children, from which all indications of student identity had been removed. Case reports were marked out of a possible total of 4 marks. Six of the 10 case reports received the same marks from all examiners; marks for the other four reports did not vary by more than 1 mark. In the documentation of their critical reflection in the case reports, most students showed a good understanding of the particular issues involved in providing equitable care to Maori children. We surveyed 64 students, of whom 51 (79%) responded and 40 (62.5%) rated the case report as useful or very useful in terms of increasing their understanding of the issues involved in providing health care to Maori children. At other medical schools in New Zealand cultural competency, as it relates to Maori patients, is also assessed by case reports. However, these are marked by clinicians who are not clinical teachers but have special expertise in Maori culture. We have shown that, guided by specific criteria, clinical teachers, irrespective of their cultural backgrounds, can assess the cultural aspects of a case report. This approach of combining the assessment of cultural and clinical competence is consistent with our belief that the two are not separate.",
