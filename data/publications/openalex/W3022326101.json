Independent of patient and provider factors, treatment at MSH may result in lower quality of care. As black and Hispanic patients reportedly die more from kidney cancer, understanding the origin of the disparity is crucial to addressing it. Here, we assess whether kidney cancer care differs between minority-serving hospitals (MSH) and non-MSH. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) from 2004 to 2015 we identified 240,527 adult patients diagnosed with non-metastatic kidney cancer. MSH were defined according to the proportion of Black and Hispanic patients treated at each facility. We used validated metrics for kidney cancer care, namely the odds of undergoing surgery for kidney cancer (partial or radical nephrectomy) and time from diagnosis to surgery, to measure the impact of treatment at MSH. RESULTS: 19,701 (8.2%) patients were treated at MSH and 220,826 (91.8%) at non-MSH of which 15,807 (80.2%) and 181,359 (82.1%) underwent renal surgery, respectively, p<0.001. In multivariable analysis, patients treated at MSH had lower odds of undergoing renal surgery as compared to patients treated at non-MSH, Odds Ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; p=0.002. There was no difference in time from diagnosis to surgery, mean difference -0.47 days, 95% CI -1.38 to 0.44, p=0.307. In subset analysis, white and Hispanic patients had lower odds undergoing surgery when treated at MSH, OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.94 and OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.97, respectively. Further, when MSH were low-volume facilities, patients also had a decreased odds of undergoing surgery, OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.81; p<0.001. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment at MSH is associated with a lower likelihood of receiving surgery for kidney cancer. This effect is modified by race/ethnicity and by facility volume, which suggests a combination of health access, patient, and facility factors contribute to racial disparities in kidney cancer care.
