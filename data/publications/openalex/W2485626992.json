  "abstract": "attacking it in order to see how invariably the ants rushed out in force to repel the intruder.I also noted many young seedlings both living and dead, but of my own knowledge could scarcely venture so far as to say that the dead ones had succumbed owing to the ants having neglected to bite them !An account of some of the more remarkable of my discoveries and introductions may be found in the Appendix to this volume, p. 339.In conclusion, I may be allowed to say that the far interior of Borneo still remains to be explored.It is emphatically a wild land without roads or bridges, and a march right across the island from the north-east to the north-west coast, although a formidable undertaking, would if accomplished reveal much that is at present unknown.",
