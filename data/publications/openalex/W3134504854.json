  "title": "Assessing the current status of rural domestic solid waste management in Nam Dinh province",
  "abstract": "The management, collection and treatment of domestic solid waste in rural areas are of great significance to reduce its amount generated to the environment. The study has determined that the total amount of rural domestic solid waste generated in Nam Dinh province is 660 tons/day with the average amount of 0.31 ÷ 0.35 kg/person/day and the collection rate is 87 % (about 575 tons/day). The amount of organic in the solid waste is about 60% of total solid waste. Currently, the solid waste is not separated at the source. Specifically, 47 % solid waste (about 112,968 tons/year) is treated by landfilling. Besides that, 43 % solid waste in this province is burned in the incinerator. In the areas where the collection conditions face difficulties, local people self-treat domestic solid waste at home by burning, burying, or composting it, which accounts for 10.0 % of the total amount. In this province, one of the well – known private companies, Tan Thien Phu has manufactured incinerators with the LOSHIHO brand having capacity up to 1,000 tons/day. Combustion method can be used at the sanitation landfill to reduce the volume of wastes brought to burial sites and limit the environmental pollution. Therefore, to achieve sustainable development in this province, it is necessary to improve solid waste management with solutions relating to the separation, collection, storage and treatment of domestic solid waste.",
