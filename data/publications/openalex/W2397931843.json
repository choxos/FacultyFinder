  "title": "Inhaled NO impacts vascular but not extravascular compartments in postischemic peripheral organs",
  "abstract": "Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) reduces pulmonary hypertension and dampens various aspects of lung inflammation; however, its effects are thought to be restricted to the lung because of its short half-life in biological systems. More recently, however, NO was shown to nitrosylate hemoglobin, albumin, and other plasma molecules to form stable nitrosothiol derivatives and could have an impact on the periphery. We examined whether inhaled NO could have an impact on the two compartments of distal organs, namely, the intravascular and extravascular spaces. The feline intestine was exposed to 1 h of ischemia and 1 h of reperfusion, and intestinal blood flow and mucosal dysfunction were measured in animals ventilated with room air and inhaling 0 or 80 ppm NO. A decrease in intestinal blood flow and an increase in mucosal barrier leakiness were noted in animals not exposed to inhaled NO. The intestinal blood flow impairment was entirely reversed in animals breathing 80 ppm NO, but the mucosal dysfunction was not affected. We further examined whether inhaled NO could reach the extravascular space by simply inhibiting NO in the intestine with the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) that causes an increase in mucosal permeability that is rapidly reversed with NO donors. However, inhaled NO had no effect on the rise in mucosal permeability. L-NAME reduced lymph nitrosothiol concentrations, but inhaled NO could not replenish these levels. To further explore the intravascular impact of inhaled NO, we used intravital microscopy to visualize the microvasculature and demonstrated that inhaled NO could be initiated after reperfusion and still reduced microvascular disturbances, including reversing the impairment in blood flow and increasing leukocyte adhesion. The effects of inhaled NO persisted for an additional hour after termination of NO inhalation, consistent with a dramatic increase in nitrate within 1 h of NO inhalation, which persisted for 1 h after the termination of NO inhalation. These data suggest that inhaled NO can reach distal organs to dramatically improve reperfusion-induced microvascular but not extravascular dysfunction.",
