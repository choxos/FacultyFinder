  "title": "27 EDI Practices Amongst Academic Leaders at a Tertiary Paediatric Centre",
  "abstract": "Abstract Background Our university’s strategic approach to Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (EDI) includes institutional capacity and commitment. Embedded within this pillar is the establishment of “systems, structures and policies that sustain EDI commitments through leadership, governance and accountability”. 1.Objectives: To ascertain baseline EDI practices of Division Leaders and the Department Executive Team 2.To identify prioritized training/learning needs early in the tenure of the inaugural Associate Chair, EDI Design/Methods An anonymized, 10 question electronic survey was distributed to division leads and executive team members with the Department of Paediatrics. Results An electronic survey was distributed to 22 people and 14 responded (64% response rate). Only 21% of leaders included a land acknowledgement at the beginning of their division, portfolio, or committee meetings. Reasons for not doing so included: • Meetings are informal or have few people • Worried about tokenism/checking a box • Had not thought to do so 29% of leaders have a standing “EDI matters” agenda item for their division, portfolio, or committee meetings. Reasons for not doing so included: • Attempting to incorporate EDI principles into work • Addressing EDI items as they occur • Unsure how to engage in meaningful action • Had not thought to do so The majority of leaders who responded, 79%, completed bias education and/or training. All the respondents want more, or specific, EDI training for their division(s) or portfolio(s). Racism was identified as the #1 equity issue urgently impacting divisions or teams. Other priority areas identified included: 2SLGBTQIA+, gender equity, Indigenous reconciliation, and employment bias. Other themes that were raised included: • Equitable healthcare access • Representation at decision-making tables • Gender bias impact on career and work opportunities • Bias in the workplace • Becoming an antiracist organization • Engaging everyone in antiracist work • Systemically embedding EDI principles • Equitable opportunities and support for all employees That 36% of department leaders did not respond to our brief EDI survey may need to be explored further. Conclusion Most leaders are not routinely doing land acknowledgments or incorporating EDI into agendas as a standing item. All expressed a desire for more EDI training. Survey responses informed priorities for the first term of the Inaugural Associate Chair, EDI. An EDI-focused Grand Rounds Series and an EDI SharePoint site were created. Leaders are encouraged to make EDI awareness integral to daily tasks from initial recruitment. Our Anti-Racism Coalition’s version of the Power Flower (Figure 1) was shared to enhance awareness of various power differentials at play.",
