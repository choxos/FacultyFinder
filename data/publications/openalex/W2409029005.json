In this study the impact of INH treatment on the immune response after repeated intravesical BCG administration was investigated in guinea pigs. INH was given on the 3 days around each BCG instillation. We found that the administration of INH severely impaired the immunological effects of BCG. The induction of mononuclear cell infiltration in the bladder wall was reduced. Enlargement of the regional lymph nodes (weight and number of cells), and increase of MHC Class II expression on the lymph node cells, normally observed after intravesical BCG administration, were inhibited by INH. Systemic immunity, measured by the DTH reaction in the skin to PPD, was also diminished due to the combined treatment of BCG with INH. When INH was administered during the last 4 of 6 BCG instillations, the immune response to BCG was still impaired. A five-fold increase of the dose of BCG did not overcome the effect of INH. INH probably did not exert a direct suppression of the immune system of the guinea pig as the DNCB skin reactivity was not influenced. Although INH concentrations in the urine were high at the onset of the instillation, in vitro experiments indicated that the effect of INH may not be caused by killing of the BCG organisms shortly after application in the bladder. In conclusion, our data in guinea pigs suggest that the use of INH may impair the immune response to intravesical BCG. As this response may be important for the antitumor effect of BCG, urologists should be cautious with the prophylactic use of INH. The influence on the antitumor efficacy is now investigated in man. © 1992 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited ByDUREK C, RÜSCH-GERDES S, JOCHAM D and BÖHLE A (2018) INTERFERENCE OF MODERN ANTIBACTERIALS WITH BACILLUS CALMETTE-GUERIN VIABILITYJournal of Urology, VOL. 162, NO. 6, (1959-1962), Online publication date: 1-Dec-1999.Vegt P, van der Meijden A, Sylvester R, Brausi M, Holtl W and de Balincourt C (2018) Does Isoniazid Reduce Side Effects of Intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin Therapy in Superficial Bladder Cancer?
