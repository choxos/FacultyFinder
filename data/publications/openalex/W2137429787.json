The signature measures the expression levels of 31 genes involved in cell cycle progression (CCP). The CCP score has proven to have prognostic utility in predicting disease progression in various clinical settings utilizing biopsy, TURP and post prostatectomy specimens. Previous studies evaluating post−surgical outcomes were conducted using CCP gene expression measured in the prostatectomy specimen. Here, we demonstrate the ability of the CCP score to predict cancer progression, as measured by both BCR and metastatic disease after radical prostatectomy, using needle biopsy tissue. METHODS We evaluated the CCP score in three patient cohorts. These included men from the Martini Clinic in Hamburg Germany (MC, N=283) treated between 2005 and 2006, men from the Durham VA Medical Center (DVA, N=176) treated between 1992 and 2007, and finally, men from Intermountain Healthcare treated between 1999 and 2002 (IHC, N=123). The CCP score was derived from a simulated biopsy (MC) or diagnostic biopsy (DVA and IHC), and evaluated for association with biochemical recurrence (BCR) and metastatic disease in univariable analysis and after adjusting for other clinical information. RESULTS In all three cohorts, the CCP score was associated with BCR and metastatic disease. The association with BCR remained significant after adjusting for other prognostic clinical variables. In a meta−analysis that combined all three cohorts (N=582), the CCP score was a strong predictor of BCR in both univariable (HR per Interquartile Range (IQR) = 1.68 (95%CI: 1.41, 1.99), p−value < 10−6)) and multivariable analyses (HR per IQR = 1.53 (95%CI: 1.28, 1.84), p−value < 10−4)). CCP score was the strongest predictor of metastatic disease in both univariable analysis (HR per IQR = 6.32 (95% CI: 3.41, 11.71, p−value < 10−7)), and after adjusting for clinical variables (HR per IQR = 4.83 (95% CI: 2.40, 9.74, p−value < 10−5)). CONCLUSIONS The CCP score derived from a needle biopsy sample was strongly associated with adverse outcome after surgery. It was the strongest predictor of eventual metastatic disease of the tested variables including Gleason and PSA. These results indicate that the CCP score can be used at disease diagnosis to better define patient prognosis and appropriate clinical care. © 2014FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 191Issue 4SApril 2014Page: e935 Peer Review Report Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2014MetricsAuthor Information Jay Bishoff More articles by this author Stephen Freedland More articles by this author Leah Gerber More articles by this author Pierre Tennstedt More articles by this author William Welbourn More articles by this author Julia Reid More articles by this author Markus Graefen More articles by this author Zaina Sangale More articles by this author Eliso Tikishvili More articles by this author Jimmy Park More articles by this author Adib Younus More articles by this author Alexander Gutin More articles by this author Jerry Lanchbury More articles by this author Guido Sauter More articles by this author Michael Brawer More articles by this author Steven Stone More articles by this author Thorsten Schlomm More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
