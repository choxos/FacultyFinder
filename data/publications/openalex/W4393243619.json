  "abstract": "The objective of this study is to analyze the benefits of the Social Cognitive Pedagogical Model in the development of autonomy of children in the First Year of High School of the “San José de Guaytacama” Educational Unit. The research had a mixed approach, presenting several research modalities: bibliographic research and field research, according to the characteristics of the study, the level was descriptive and exploratory. The results pointed to the overprotection of a high percentage of children, whose parents inhibit them from living experiences and responsibilities appropriate to their age. Furthermore, it was evident that the model under study promotes the child’s interaction with society through the resolution of real problems that strengthen their self-management and identity, with the support of teachers and representatives.",
