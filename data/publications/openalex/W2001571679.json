METHODS Questionnaires were mailed to 3,000 women aged 18-79 years randomly selected from the national population register. Subjects were classified as never/former/current smokers using questions: \"Have you ever smoked?\", \"Do you still smoke?\". Information on urinary storage symptoms was collected using the DAN-PSS with an additional AUA-SI nocturia question. Urinary urgency, urgency incontinence (UUI) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI) were defined as abnormal if reported often or always (scale: never/seldom/often/always). Urinary frequency was defined as abnormal if longest interval between each urination was reported as <2 hours (scale: >3h, 2-3h, 1-2h, <1h) and nocturia as at least 2 voids/night. Information on self-reported physician-diagnosed comorbidity (33 conditions), prescribed medication (26 ATC groups), sociodemographic, lifestyle (BMI, coffee, alcohol) and reproductive factors were treated as potential confounders. Based on comorbidity and medications, Confounder Scores were calculated. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated for each symptom with age adjustment (B, bivariate). All factors associated with (particular) symptom in the age-adjusted analysis were entered as potential confounders into multivariate model. At each step, the covariate that caused the smallest change in the exposure effect estimates (compared with full model estimates) upon deletion was removed. The process was stopped when deletion of each of the remaining variables caused >10% relative change (M, multivariate). RESULTS 2,002 (67%) women took part; 114 were excluded due to pregnancy, puerperium or urinary tract infection. Of the women, 52.7% never smoked, 24.1% were former and 23.2% current smokers. Urinary frequency, nocturia, SUI, urgency and UUI were reported by 7.1%, 12.6%, 11.2%, 9.7% and 3.1% of women (age-standardized). Current (and former) smoking were associated with urinary urgency and frequency but not with nocturia or incontinence in multivariate analyses.

CONCLUSIONS Urinary urgency and frequency were associated with smoking whereas nocturia and stress incontinence was not. Strengths of this analysis include high response rate, representative study population, and adjustment for major confounders. © 2010 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 183Issue 4SApril 2010Page: e682 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2010 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Theodore M.
