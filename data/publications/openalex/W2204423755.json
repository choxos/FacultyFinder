  "title": "Shared Promises and Challenges of Coteaching: General-Special Education and Mentor Preservice Partnerships",
  "abstract": "Coteaching has two important but different applications in schools. First, coteaching between in-service general and special educators provides support for students with disabilities included in general education settings. Second, coteaching between cooperating or mentor teachers and their student teachers provides support for student teachers in developing their professional competencies. Using the term coteaching to describe these two applications often confuses teacher candidates as well as university and school personnel. Therefore, teachers, school administrators, and university personnel need clarification and understanding of these two applications including (1) their purposes, (2) positive outcomes, (3) factors that facilitate their success and (4) barriers that prevent success. In this descriptive article, the authors reflect on these two coteaching applications and their implications for teacher educators. The authors draw illustrations from recent studies in the research literature and their own experience in higher education with current coteachers and preservice teacher candidates. The authors conclude that though the two applications of coteaching differ in some aspects, they hold promise for informing and enhancing each other.",
