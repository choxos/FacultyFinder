  "title": "Reports on Colloquium Sessions",
  "abstract": "The predominant theme of this, the opening session of the colloquium, was the marked avoidance of race and ethnicity as explanatory concepts in South African historical writing during the era of white supremacy.There was, however, general recognition of a greater willingness to engage with issues of race and ethnicity in the more recent past.The main speaker, Professor Saul Dubow of Sussex University, started off by observing that, while studies of race and ethnicity have of late become quite fashionable in the South African academy, these concepts had previously been shunned as explanatory tools.This was partly a consequence of the political context, as the liberatory movement, particularly those sections allied to the African National Congress, sought to counter apartheid by fostering non-racial values and had a general `disdain for any hint of tribalism'.Also, the intellectual climate was one strongly influenced by Marxist theory, which emphasised class as central to understanding historical change.Dubow, in addition, identified the Non-European Unity Movement's rejection of Coloured identity as a meaningful category and the liberal tradition with its universalist premises as significant to the regional context in which UCT operated.He, moreover, noted that this avoidance of race and ethnicity occurred before the influence of post-modernist theory on the discipline, when `it was taken as an article of faith that the authorial self ought to be concealed in the interests of objectivity and detachment'.Next, Dubow identified a number of influences that encouraged South African historians to engage more seriously with questions of race and ethnicity from and after the early 1980s.Firstly, a growing body of scholarship on Africa from the 1960s onwards demonstrated that ethnic affiliations were `not some simple hangover from the pre-colonial past, but were intimately associated with the creation of modernity'.Secondly, a seminal conference held at the University of Virginia in 1983 and the resultant volume, The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa, edited by Leroy Vail, presented a wide range of case studies of the malleability of ethnic identities in southern and central Africa.Drawing on the",
