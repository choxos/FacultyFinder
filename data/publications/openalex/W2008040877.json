  "title": "“Our Modern Skulls House a Stone Age Brain”: An Overview and Annotated Bibliography of Evolutionary Psychology, Part I",
  "abstract": "Abstract In the first of this two-part series, some of the major tenets and current applications of evolutionary psychology are briefly outlined for behavioral and social science librarians. Special note is taken of its controversial beliefs in the evolutionarily hard-wired nature of human sexual attraction and mate choice, its description of the relative role of gender over the course of evolution, and, in particular, its notion that rape may have had a basis in an evolutionary adaptation. Three annotated lists of recommended works are included. The first lists works in favor of the theory; the second, works that take a more critical view but are generally supportive; and the third of works that take serious exception to the field in whole or in part. Reviews of recommended books are summarized and citation counts of some articles regarded as classic in the field are provided. The second part of this series will focus on specific physical traits and courtship behaviors that have been closely studied by evolutionary psychologists as key to understanding human sexual attraction and mate choice.
