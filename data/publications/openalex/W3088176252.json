  "title": "Commentary on Raitasalo<i>et al</i>.: Looking beyond the borders—what else is driving the decline in adolescent alcohol consumption?",
  "abstract": "In order to understand the decline in adolescent drinking it is important to examine country-specific factors as well as far-reaching factors which changed contemporaneously with adolescent drinking. Examination of such potential factors should be carried out between countries with similar as well as different drinking cultures and control policies. Raitasalo and colleagues [1] have provided new insights into the ongoing investigations of declining youth drinking by conducting a robust cross-national analysis among countries with similar drinking cultures and political environments. They found that reductions in the perceived availability of alcohol and daily smoking, along with increases in parental control were associated with the decline in heavy episodic drinking (HED) across Finland, Norway and Sweden between 1999 and 2015. The novel analytical design utilized in the study provided significant evidence that three countries with similar drinking cultures and alcohol policies have the same factors associated with a decline in adolescent HED. While these factors seem to have made a substantial contribution to the decline in HED in the included countries, the authors themselves highlight that a large portion of the decline remained unexplained. Changes in parental practices and attitudes seem to be emerging as a key theme in this area [2, 3]. A recent systematic review by Vashishtha et al. [4] indicated that the most robust evidence for explanatory factors underpinning the decline in adolescent alcohol consumption relates to a range of parental factors. It has been established previously that general aspects of parenting such as parent–child relationship quality, parental support and parental involvement play a key role in preventing adolescent alcohol misuse [5, 6]. Future research could be extended to examine the role of broader parenting domains in reducing adolescent alcohol use, beyond the relatively simple measure of parental control included in Raitasalo et al.’s study [1]. The European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs (ESPAD) [7-12] extensively captures various aspects of parenting and provides a unique opportunity to examine how those may be related to declining drinking trends among adolescents. Of course, even if parental factors emerge as the key driver of declines in youth drinking, it remains important to understand the underlying mechanisms that might be driving changes in parenting practices in different countries. These questions will require researchers to step outside relatively narrow alcohol studies frameworks and consider youth and family studies research more broadly. Raitasalo et al. [1] have shown the benefits of taking a cross-national approach to understanding youth drinking trends. We would argue that this approach should be extended even further. The decline in adolescent drinking has been observed in almost all European countries [13]; however, the timing and magnitude of such declines are not consistent even within the same regions of Europe [14]. For example, Denmark and Iceland have shown huge variation in youth drinking trends, despite having broadly similar cultures and political structures. Raitasalo et al.’s study [1] relies upon culturally and politically similar countries and has focussed on factors that changed similarly in the three countries. However, it would be interesting to examine and compare trends in these selected factors and how their associations with adolescent alcohol use varies in other countries with similar drinking cultures (such as Canada and Iceland), and even countries with quite different political and cultural systems around alcohol (such as Lithuania and Germany). It would also be interesting to study the extent of contribution of factors that have varied more sharply between countries to reducing adolescent alcohol use. These factors might include changes in leisure-time activities such as social media or digital involvement. The rapid advancements in digital technology have not been uniform in all countries, with some having early initiation of internet use, for example Iceland, while others having a delayed start, such as the eastern European countries [15]. Finally, public health researchers continue, with good reason, to emphasize the positives of these declines in youth drinking in terms of probable reductions in alcohol-related harms in the short- and long-term [16]. However, it has been increasingly reported that mental health for these cohorts has been worsening [17]. It could be that increases in financial, health and life insecurities might be worsening young people's mental health while contributing to the declines in drinking. There is a need to more broadly examine how these declines in adolescent drinking fit into the general life experiences and satisfaction of recent birth cohorts. Overall, it is clear that the field is making steady progress in understanding factors that explain the long-running declines in youth drinking observed since the early 2000s. Nevertheless, there remains work to do, both in terms of unpicking country-specific factors as well as broadening our analyses to incorporate more far-reaching factors which changed contemporaneously with adolescent drinking. Future research work should be directed towards examining and comparing potential explanatory factors in countries with similar as well as different drinking cultures and control policies and towards better exploring how the declines relate to outcomes for young people more broadly.
