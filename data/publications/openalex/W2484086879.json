  "abstract": "FORMATIONwhich I could pinpoint localities and trace formations and key beds.To this montage map I added some of the road and track network, the Range-Township grid, and for a decade recorded the progress of my systematic collecting.I expected to publish this in lieu of any avail- able geologic map.About 1967 a decision was reached by the United States Geological Survey to map the entire Washakie Basin area, both topographically and geologically.Delighted at the prospect of soon having available fine quality maps, I abandoned plans to publish the air photo map and began an informal and productive period of co-operation with Mr. Henry Roehler, the Survey geologist assigned the geologic mapping project.For recording stratigraphic and collecting locality information, I continued to use my air photo mosaic map during the uncertain interval until the new maps appeared.By 1974 the Survey's topo- graphic mapping was complete, but circumstances had altered.It now appears unlikely that a significant part, if any more, of the planned Geologic Quadrangle sheets covering the Washakie Forma- tion outcrop area will be completed within the forseeable future.Hence to provide a map it has again become necessary to publish the air photo mosaic.The map, including its quadrant enlargements, and the introduc- tion to the geology, history, and setting together comprise this first section of the series.Subsequent sections will not follow any systematic, geochronologic, or stratigraphic order, except that the second of the series will cover the very fragmentary materials recovered from the Kinney Rim Member to document their morphology and to give evidence of the faunal age stage represented.Beyond this, additional numbers will appear as they are readied, and I will try to heed the priorities of other workers whenever possible.",
