  "title": "Students' Perceptions of the School Climate",
  "abstract": "Abstract Abstract This study assessed school climate for both interpersonal and intrapersonal character traits and examined the links between school climate and students' perceptions of safety at school. Sixty-four elementary and 159 secondary students completed questionnaires in the spring. Findings revealed that character traits were reliably assessed for both grade levels. School climate was significantly related to safety, particularly interpersonal and environmental safety, while criminal/delinquent safety concerns were less related to character. Both interpersonal and intrapersonal character traits were related to students' perceptions of safety. Discussion focuses on possible linkages connecting school climate and safety and the need for further research. Key Words: School climateschool safetycharacter traitselementarysecondary",
