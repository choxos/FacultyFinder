  "title": "Torn Between Two Lovers? Caught in the Middle of British and American IPE1",
  "abstract": "Click to increase image sizeClick to decrease image size Notes With apologies to Mary MacGregor. There were a few places doing IR in the UK to be sure, but New York versus Canterbury really isn't a contest when you are 23 years old. I chose International Studies Quarterly (ISQ) over International Organization (IO) because doing IO as representative of all American IPE would have been, in a sense, too easy a target. The recent editorial boards of IO have exhibited a penchant for the formal and the quantitative to the exclusion of other work (by no means totally). However, that does not mean that there is no other American work. So I chose ISQ, a more general journal that takes an interest in IPE issues. Some 16 per cent had no obvious theoretical proclivity. All numbers are rounded up. Any category scoring less than 5 per cent has been left off along with those that defy categorisation (36 per cent of the total). Again, any category scoring less than 5% has been eliminated. A similar point is made by Nicola Phillips (2009 Phillips, N. 2009. The Slow Death of Pluralism. Review of International Political Economy, 16(1): 85–94. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]: 89–91). If you want an example of this, think about the huge literature on 'independent' central banks and how important they are for stability. Not looking too independent at the moment now are they? Geoffrey Underhill, in this issue, seems to have had a very similar experience at BISA. Cameron and Palan (2009) Cameron, A. and Palan, R. 2009. \"Empiricism and Objectivity: Reflexive Theory Construction in a Complex World\". In The Routledge Handbook of IPE: IPE as a Global Conversation, Edited by: Blyth, M. 112–25. London and New York: Routledge. [Google Scholar] report a similar story. When I pointed this out at the conference I was told that such criticisms (curve fitting, data mining, confirmation bias etc.) are wide of the mark since this work is 'post-positivist'.",
