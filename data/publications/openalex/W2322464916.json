  "abstract": "Introduction: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetically determined heart muscle disease most often caused by mutations in one of several sarcomere genes which encode components of the contractile apparatus. HCM is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy of various morphologies, with a wide array clinical manifestations and hemodynamic abnormalities. Advanced heart failure symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema are uncommon. Here we present a unique case of recurrent pulmonary edema where prompt action led to accurate diagnosis and appropriate management. Case: A 44 year old man with past medical history of bronchial asthma was scheduled for bronchoscopy for history of recurrent pulmonary edema. The idea was to rule out any structural airway abnormality leading to pulmonary edema. All the other diagnostic tests in the past including trans thoracic echocardiogram (TTE), trans esophageal echocardiogram, cardiac stress test and cardiac catheterization were inconclusive. Patient was empty stomach since last night for procedure. Pre procedure vital signs were within normal range. A 5 mg of I.V. midazolam and 50 mcg of I.V. fentanyl were administered for sedation. Patient became hypotensive with B.P. of 95/60 mmHg and hypoxic with oxygen saturation of 79% on room air immediately after administration of these drugs. He was then started on oxygen therapy via Venturi mask. A stat chest X-ray (CXR) was done which showed pulmonary edema. A 12 lead ECG was normal. A bed side TTE revealed left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction of 60-65%, basilar septal hypertrophy and some evidence of left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction. A small bolus of I.V. normal saline was administered which improved his symptoms. Patient was then started on a low dose metoprolol and I.V. fluids at a slow rate. A TTE repeated next day revealed normal findings. All other diagnostic tests including bronchoscopy done during this hospitalization were negative. A CXR at the time of discharge showed resolution of pulmonary edema. Discuss: Many patients with HCM have no or only minor symptoms; thus, affected individuals are often undiagnosed or diagnosed incidentally. Depending upon the site and extent of cardiac hypertrophy, HCM patients can develop LVOT obstruction. LVOT obstruction is confirmed by 2-D echocardiography, which characteristically demonstrates hyper dynamic LV function with a small (under filled) LV cavity. In HCM patients, volume depletion tends to decrease stroke volume and increase or precipitate the left ventricular outflow gradient, and may lead to hypotension, lightheadedness and syncope. in severe cases it can lead to flash pulmonary edema, as evident in our case where preload was affected by medications. Less severe cases can be managed with oral fluids and administration of a beta blocker. Severe obstruction usually resolves rapidly by increasing preload with elevation of the legs and administration of intravenous fluids.",
