  "title": "Flexible search and presentation of multimedia",
  "abstract": "Although the amount of image and video files in our hard disks and the web is steadily increasing, we rely on classical retrieval and presentation techniques which can not cope with large collections. Retrieval is still based on textual annotations and the presentation interfaces are mostly simple thumbnail lists. In this talk, I will present search and retrieval beyond and in combination with text, and how this can be used and incorporated in media workflows. Furthermore, based on recent work, I will show how users can aggregate their collections into larger repositories, publish them, and design themselves flexible user interfaces by recomposing UI elements and retrieval models. On that basis, I will also discuss ways of presenting multimedia collections using facets and concepts stemming from information visualization. Biography: George Ioannidis holds a Master of Science (MSEE) and a doctoral degree (PhD) in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the National Technical University of Athens, the leading university in engineering sciences of Greece. He additionally holds a Master of Business Administration (MBA) where the main focus of his work was on innovation management. After several positions in academia among others leading the image and video analysis group at the Center for Computing Technologies in Bremen, he founded 2005 IN2 (http://www.in-two.com) and is since then its director. He has initiated, participated and managed several European research projects in the fields of multimedia information retrieval, content management and content accessibility. His primary research interests are on dynamically adaptive visualizations, especially from the search and retrieval perspective, which support browsing and navigating multimedia collections and individual multimedia assets. George acts regularly as a programme committee member in international conferences and workshops (e.g. ACM Multimedia Information Retrieval), Journals (e.g. Knowledge Engineering Review) and serves as a reviewer of business plan competitions, and as an evaluator and reviewer of national and international collaborative research projects.",
