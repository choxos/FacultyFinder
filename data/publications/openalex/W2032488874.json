  "title": "Bess Carey's Petrarch. Newly discovered Elizabethan sonnets",
  "abstract": "An allusion by Thomas Nashe in The Terrors of the Night (1594) has led scholars to believe that Lady Elizabeth Carev, nee Spencer, made some translations from Petrarch, now lost. However, a manuscript among the Berkely Castle muniments shows that her daughter and namesake translated two Petrarch sonnets in about 1594 Nashe may have confused the daughter's writings with those of her mother. the younger Elizabeth Carey—here referred to as ‘Bess’ to avoid such confusion—seems to have made versions with the help of her father's household chaplain, Henry Stanford The manuscript is in his hand, and includes six other poems, four of them translations of sonnets by Desportes, which may be of his authorship The article includes a transcription of all eight poems, and offers some account of the literary interests of both women.",
