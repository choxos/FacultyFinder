  "title": "Response to Intervention: Educators' Perceptions of a Three-Year RTI Collaborative Reform Effort in an Urban Elementary School",
  "abstract": "What are educators' perceptions of the adoption and effectiveness of the Response to Intervention (RTI) model in their own schools? Over a three-year time span, the authors interviewed educators at an urban elementary school about their perceptions of an RTI model, tracking the model's development and the effectiveness of the implementation. The study was conducted through a university-school partnership that involved these elementary school educators from the initial planning through the implementation of the model while providing the professional development that was required to support the model. While the educators initially viewed the model as an administrative directive, they began to assume responsibility for the model's implementation during the second year as they considered themselves change agents and problem solvers for their school. During the third year, with continued administrative support and evidence of the model's effectiveness, participants engaged in the additional development and growth of the model and assumed responsibility for the model's sustainability as part of the school change process. Results suggest that RTI's collaborative structures, related professional development, and co-shared leadership supported the implementation process and contributed to the effectiveness of the model. Implications for practice are discussed.",
