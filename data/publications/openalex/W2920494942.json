Exposure to endocrine disruptor, such as phthalates, could affect endocrine system and adipokine secretion. We aimed to investigate the association between prenatal phthalate exposure and childhood adipokine levels using a birth cohort study established in central Taiwan, 2001. A total of 430 pregnant women were originally recruited. Their children had been followed at the age of 2, 5, 8, and 11 years old. Urine and blood samples were collected in the third trimester of pregnancy women and children. Maternal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations adjusted by urinary creatinine levels were considered as prenatal phthalate ester exposure levels in children. Plasma levels of leptin and adiponectin were evaluated in each follow-up for children's adipokine markers. We used linear regression analysis and generalized estimating equation (GEE) model to evaluate the relationship between prenatal phthalate exposure and adipokine levels in children. After excluding multiple births and children lost to follow up, a total of 245 pairs with children followed at least once during study period were included in subsequent analysis. An association was found between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and weight gain in pregnant women. By GEE model, maternal urinary 5oxoMEHP concentration was found positively associated with children's body mass index (BMI) values, and negatively associated with adiponectin levels in children. A negative association was also found between MnBP and 5OHMEHP concentration and leptin levels. Prenatal phthalate exposure was found associated with weight gain in pregnant women and BMI, adiponectin, and leptin levels in children. Among them, the effect of DEHP metabolites, including 5oxoMEHP and 5OHMEHP, were more obvious than others. The results suggested that phthalate exposure was related to adipokine levels.",
