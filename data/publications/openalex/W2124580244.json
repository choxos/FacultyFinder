  "title": "Desiccation resistance in arboreal and terrestrial ants",
  "abstract": "ABSTRACT Arboreal and terrestrial ants were exposed to 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 (control)% r.h., at 30 o C. Desiccation resistance increased with body size (as dry weight 0.55 ), but not as quickly as expected from the consequences of the surface area and volume relationship (as dry weight 0.67 ). Arboreal ants took 8 times longer to die than terrestrial ants of comparable size. Even after size effects were removed, desiccation resistance differed between various terrestrial species and showed a correlation with foraging patterns. Arboreal and terrestrial ants whose waterproofing epicuticular lipids were removed by chloroform: methanol extraction had equally high water loss rates at 0% r.h. Unextracted arboreal ants had water loss rates half those of unextracted terrestrial ants, suggesting that differences between them were based on differences in epicuticular lipids. The lower water loss rates of arboreal ants contributed significantly to their longer survival under desiccation. Arboreal ants also had greater total rectal pad area than terrestrial ants, suggesting that they may be able to reclaim faecal water more effectively. There were no differences in the minimum viable water content between the two groups of ants. Both had water loss tolerances comparable with those of arthropods adapted to xeric environments. Initial water loss rates could not account for all of the differences in desiccation resistance between arboreal and terrestrial ants. Other adaptations to desiccation stress by arboreal ants are likely. Comparisons of water loss rates and desiccation resistance between arboreal and desert ants suggest that the arboreal habitat is at least as stressful as the desert habitat.",
