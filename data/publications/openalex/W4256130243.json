This is pertinent in childhood surgery with issues of consent, and condition prevalence. Our aims were to evaluate the methodological and reporting quality of these reviews, and to identify how these reviews might guide clinical practice amongst those conditions most commonly encountered and managed by paediatric urology residents and fellows METHODS: A systematic search of the English literature was performed to identify systematic reviews and meta-analyses focusing on clinical paediatric urology (1/1/2000-7/9/2018) to include common paediatric urological conditions managed by paediatric urology residents/fellows. To these reviews, AMSTAR-2 and PRISMA scores were applied. Univariate linear regression and descriptive statistical methods were performed RESULTS: From an initial literature review of 389 articles, 101 were included in the analysis. Inter-reviewer agreement was high (κ = 0.92). 70% systematic reviews/meta-analyses were published since 2013. The overall impact factor was 3.38 (0.83 – 17.58), with adherence to AMSTAR-2 criteria 48.46% and PRISMA criteria 73.32%. From a methodological perspective, 62.5% reviews were of poor quality, with 37.5% of fair quality, 50% reviews were found to have good quality reporting CONCLUSIONS: Despite the continued increase of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in paediatric urology from which many guidelines are based, a significant number contain poor methodology, and to a lesser extent poor reporting quality. Journals should consider having specific “a priori” criteria based on checklists prior to publication of manuscripts in order to ensure the highest possible reporting quality Source of Funding: None Toronto, Canada; Hamilton, Canada; Toronto, Canada© 2019 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 201Issue Supplement 4April 2019Page: e907-e908 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2019 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Fardod O'Kelly* More articles by this author Keara De Cotiis More articles by this author Luis Braga More articles by this author Armando Lorenzo More articles by this author Martin Koyle More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
