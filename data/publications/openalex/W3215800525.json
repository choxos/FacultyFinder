  "title": "The Legacy of Leo Panitch",
  "abstract": "The shock of Leo Panitch's untimely death in December of 2020 has worn off; our sense of profound loss has not.In the days that followed his passing, emails, editorials, obituaries, and forums appeared describing his immense intellectual, political, and personal influence.These tributes have captured something of his legacy, while also articulating the sadness experienced by so many of his friends and colleagues.Articles assessing his global influence have appeared in the mainstream press as well as left-wing magazines and blogs; emails and letters flooded in from socialist comrades across the globe, and a number of public forums assessed and celebrated his extensive contributions to political and scholarly projects, most especially his lifelong commitment to furthering Marxist scholarship and the building of democratic socialism. 1harles, as a former student, cannot quite fathom a world without Leo's guidance.As a scholar and a teacher, Leo was able to both inspire and lend critical guidance for his students to challenge perceived liberal and capitalist 1.It is not possible to cite all of Leo's immense body of work on these topics, but his End of Parliamentary Socialism (with Colin Leys) 1997, the Making of Global Capitalism (with Sam Gindin) 2012 and his own Renewing Socialism: Democracy, Strategy, and Imagination (2002) all reflect these important themes.orthodoxy, while never lessening our academic standards or critical lens.Joan, as a Socialist Register board member, will miss Leo as a generous friend, a committed socialist with unending dedication to building a better future, and a comrade who welcomed her socialist-feminist input into the Register.It is difficult to truly appreciate Leo's legacy in its entirety, since it was so varied, extensive, and international, emanating from his multiple and many roles -as teacher, mentor, socialist public intellectual, political scientist, theorist, editor, provocateur, and friend.He built academic departments of critical political economy at Carleton and York Universities and he had a transformative impact, both in his own work and through that of his many students, on scholarship on Canadian politics, the state, labour, and working-class mobilizations.His intellectual reach was also thoroughly international: his writing and interventions had a defining impact on debates about socialism and social democracy, the British Labour Party, globalized financial capitalism, popular and labour mobilizations -and far more.His editorship of the Socialist Register helped to facilitate threads of global discussion and left-wing critique that encompassed themes ranging from utopianism to feminism, environmentalism, race, and imperialism.An original, probing Marxist theorist, he also wrote and spoke in the vernacular of popular politics and journalism, reaching out to innumerable audiences to discuss class and socialism in our time.As many remembrances have pointed out, he was an instigator, organizer, and convenor, creating the social and personal culture that kept those of us with an alternative vision of society energized, connected, and hopeful.Labour/Le Travail's tribute to Leo Panitch can only capture a portion of his academic, political, and personal legacy.The obituary opening the journal, by Reg Whitaker, offers an overview of Leo's origins in the North End of Winnipeg, his academic career and writing, and his family life.The editors also asked five scholars, including some former students, to reflect on Leo's writing and life in a roundtable tribute.Rosemary Warskett, professor emeritus at Carleton University, explores Leo's contributions to our understanding of labour, including his original and incisive Marxist analysis of the relationship between the capitalist state, labour, and working-class politics.For Leo, she affirms, theory and praxis were connected: the point was not just to understand the world but to change it.An \"organic intellectual\" who combined scholarly pursuit with activism, he devoted immense time to everyday politics, building organizations like the early Ottawa Committee for Labour Action.Eric Blanc's piece focuses on Leo's scholarship on social democracy, which provided both a \"foundation and foil\"",
