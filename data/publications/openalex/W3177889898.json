Guidelines have been hampered by reliance on limited evidence summaries and data for this issue. To address this gap, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of trials investigating the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis on infectious outcomes after SWL. METHODS: A systemic search was conducted in the Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Medline, EMBASE, CINAHEL, Web of Science, and PubMed to December 2019. Studies were screened independently and in duplicates for randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infectious outcomes after SWL for renal or ureteral stones. The Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 was used for the assessment of risk of bias. We used the GRADE methodology to evaluate the certainty of evidence. (PROSPERO CRD42020196574) RESULTS: We included 17 trials (5 quasi-randomized, 6 placebo-controlled) with approximately 3000 patients. Only 4 studies recruited participants after 2000. Meta-analysis was only feasible for urine culture, fever, and urinary tract infection (UTI) since reporting for other outcomes such as sepsis or major complication was limited. All of the included studies were at a high risk of bias. UTI was found not to be decreased statistically compared to placebo, however, the certainty in this effect estimate is very low. Also, reduction in positive urine cultures was detected compared to no prophylaxis, fever was not significantly reduced (Table1). CONCLUSIONS: Low quality clinical trials suggest limited reduction in infectious outcomes with use of antibiotic prophylaxis for SWL. A well-conducted randomized trial is warranted (APPEAL NCT03692715).
