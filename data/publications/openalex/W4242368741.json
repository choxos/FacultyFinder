  "title": "The 2006 park city appam spring conference",
  "abstract": "In 1986, a small group of public policy faculty gathered at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina, for a conference on what was then a novel enterprise in professional education for public service.The enterprise grew into the dozens of masters programs in policy analysis and management that now cover not only the United States but the globe, and on the 20th anniversary of that influential meeting, APPAM organized a conference at Park City, Utah, where a much larger group of faculty gathered to reflect backwards on how policy analysis education had evolved, and forwards on where it should be going.The Park City conference was organized around a set of commissioned papers, each providing a starting point and common ground for discussion sessions that were in turn recorded by rapporteurs.Rapporteurs were asked to write essays capturing the most important themes of their sessions, not to merely transcribe the conversation, and they did so admirably.The Curriculum and Case Notes section of JPAM will publish, over the next few issues, a selection of the papers and discussion reports, beginning here with a historic overview provided in the opening plenary address by John Ellwood, and a look at the newest development in policy education, namely, the growth of such programs outside the United States, from a group of authors in this international context.",
