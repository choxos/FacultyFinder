The data on 4693 men presented herein comprise the largest series available for primary and salvage cryoablation. METHODS Biochemical failure was defined according to the ASTRO and Phoenix definitions. Incontinence was defined as any leaking. Return to intercourse was the ability to penetrate and complete intercourse with or without assistance. Biopsy was performed at the physician's discretion, but most commonly if a patient had a rising or suspicious PSA. RESULTS For the entire group of patients, mean age was 70 years and 46% had intermediate risk cancer (56% had a Gleason Score<7, 73% had PSA<10 ng/mL and 71% had Stage<T2b). Mean follow-up was 31.8 months for primary patients and 38.5 months for salvage patients. Actuarial survivals as determined by KM analysis are reported in the figures. Of the 4099 primary patients, 18 (0.4%) reported rectal fistulas postop and 65 (3.1%) reported incontinence at 12 months. Of the 639 primary patients potent prior to treatment, 207 (32%) were sexually active at 12 months postop. Biopsies were performed in 841 (20.6%) of primary patients and were positive in 125 (14.9%). Of the 594 salvage patients, 9 (1.5%) reported rectal fistulas postop and 33 (12%) reported incontinence at 12 months. Of the 60 salvage patients potent prior to treatment, 24 (40%) were sexually active 12 months postop. Biopsies were performed in 75 (12.6%) salvage patients and were positive in 18 (24.0%). A total of 127 (21.4%) salvage patients also received hormone therapy. CONCLUSIONS Cryoablation of the prostate, practiced over a wide range of users in a variety of case presentations, is a therapy with efficacy as demonstrated by biochemical survival and low morbidity with the exception of erectile dysfunction. © 2010 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 183Issue 4SApril 2010Page: e184 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2010 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Nivedita Dhar Detroit, MI More articles by this author Michael Cher Detroit, MI More articles by this author Zachary Liss Birmingham, MI More articles by this author David Levy Cleveland, OH More articles by this author Aaron Katz New York, NY More articles by this author J.
