  "title": "Reviewing pronatalism: a summary and critical analysis of prior research examining attitudes towards women without children",
  "abstract": "This review article examines prior research on attitudes towards women without children. The progression of pronatalist values and theories within Western societies are delineated and a critical review of the research that examines attitudes towards women without children is presented. Empirical studies have consistently found that women without children are perceived more negatively than mothers. However, the existing research predominantly uses vignettes to assess attitudes, allowing for little variability in the type of questions that can be asked and the conclusions that can be drawn. Further, this research rarely adopts a theoretical approach to data collection or analysis. The methodological and theoretical limitations of this research will be discussed and avenues for future studies that can address these limitations will be outlined. Finally, the policy implications that novel research on pronatalist attitudes could have for non-mothers will be explored.",
