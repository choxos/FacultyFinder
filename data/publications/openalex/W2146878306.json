  "title": "Mine waste water management and treatment in coal mines in Vietnam",
  "abstract": "At present, Vietnam National Coal and Mineral Industries Holding Corporation Limited (VINACOMIN) controls 35 coal mines, including 10 underground mines and 25 open pits in Quang Ninh coal basin. The coal mining area in Quang Ninh has a very special characteristic that its coal seams are located near the coast of Ha Long Bay and many coal mines are situated close to the coast. Previously, mine water from the mines was not treated and discharged directly into the sea. Since 2009, VINACOMIN has constructed 29 mine water treatment stations. The management of mine water in coal mines in Quang Ninh coal basin is quite difficult due to tropical rains.This article introduces characteristics of coal mine drainage in Vietnam, the specific difficulties of coal mine drainage management and treatment, solutions that have been applied and their results. Also discussed is the necessity of technology and management experiences that are needed in order to manage the resources of coal mine drainage effectively and to contribute to the protection of the ecological environment and improve the living conditions of miners and the local community in the Quang Ninh coal field.",
