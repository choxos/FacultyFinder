  "title": "Impact of HIV Status on Outcome of Infectious Complications in Intravenous Drug Users",
  "abstract": "To the Editor: Hsieh et al1 presented a retrospective analysis of skin and soft tissue infections in febrile intravenous drug users (IDUs). Based on our own retrospective data in hospitalized IDUs presenting with infectious diseases published last year,2,3 we have performed an additional analysis which complements the interesting findings of Hsieh et al.1 In a retrospective analysis of all hospitalizations due to infections in IDUs from January 2001 to December 2006 seen by the infectious diseases service in the University hospital of Basel-a tertiary care University hospital-we have compared the management and outcome of infections in HIV-positive patients with those who were HIV negative. The main outcome parameters were the appropriateness of the prescribed therapy (defined as choice of treatment and duration of treatment according to standard guidelines for treating specific infectious diseases), the readmission rate (both overall and due to relapse), infectious disease-related and infectious disease-unrelated in-hospital mortality, overall mortality during follow-up (as ascertained by death registries for the Canton Basel-Stadt), and the noncompliance rate of patients during hospitalization (defined as disruptive behavior or violation of hospital rules, ie, if the patient did not comply with diagnostic measures or adhere to therapeutic measures or left the hospital against medical advice). For statistical analysis, a generalized estimating equation approach was used to account for multiple hospitalizations of patients as described in detail in Mertz et al.2 Results are given as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The analyses for the noncompliance rate were adjusted for gender, age, alcohol abuse, and psychiatric disorders in addition to HIV. The other reported analyses were not adjusted. In a total of 344 hospitalizations of IDUs, 120 episodes (34.9%) were known or newly found to be HIV positive, which is comparable to the 28% found in the study by Hsieh et al.1 The characteristics of all hospitalizations, the most prevalent diagnosis and appropriateness of therapy, are shown in the Table 1.TABLE 1: Characteristics of 344 Hospital EpisodesThe most frequent infections were skin and soft tissue infections overall. Noncompliance was found in 21.9% and 15.8% for HIV-negative and HIV-positive status, respectively. This difference was not significant (P = 0.24) in the adjusted analyses, whereas psychiatric disorders had a significant negative impact on compliance overall (OR: 2.38, CI: 1.11 to 5.12, P = 0.026). In contrast to the study by Hsieh et al,1 no significant association between HIV status and relapse rate within 30 days was found (P = 0.15); indeed, the observed relapse rate was lower in HIV-infected patients (1.7%) compared with others (4.9%). The overall rehospitalization rate was slightly higher for HIV-infected patients (60.8%) than others (51.3%) but not significantly so (P = 0.13). The readmission rate of 29.1% within 90 days was comparable with the HIV-positive patients in the study by Hsieh et al1 where a rate of 28.1% was reported. Survival status could be ascertained in 92.1% of patients with median follow-up of 35.6 months. Infection-related deaths (OR: 1.94, CI: 0.77 to 4.88, P = 0.161), overall in hospital mortality (OR: 2.38, CI: 1.01 to 5.60, P = 0.047) and mortality during the entire follow-up period (OR: 2.36, CI: 1.27 to 4.37, P = 0.006) all tended to be increased in HIV-positive episodes. In conclusion, we have not found a significant impact of HIV status on compliance during hospitalization and the frequency of relapses. However, HIV-positive IDUs show a significantly higher mortality during hospitalization and in the follow-up.
