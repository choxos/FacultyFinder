  "title": "Drugs, sex and AIDS: Sexual relationships among injecting drug users and their sexual partners in Vietnam",
  "abstract": "HIV transmission in Vietnam is strongly linked to drug injection, but there is the potential for an epidemic driven by sexual behaviour. HIV‐education programmes to date focus largely on personal responsibility and fail to address adequately other aspects of HIV‐related risks in social contexts. Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2002, this paper examines the association between HIV‐related risks (unsafe drug use and unsafe sex) and gender relations among injecting drug users. Three patterns of relationships are analysed: between injecting drug users and their injecting partners; between injecting drug users and their smoking partners; and between injecting drug users and their non‐using partners. Data shows that intimate relations play an important role in managing HIV‐related risks among injecting drug users. HIV prevention must pay due attention to the specific contexts of injecting drug users' lives. Some implications of these findings are discussed and relevant recommendations are proposed.",
