  "title": "An evaluation of the relationship between clinical requirements and tests of competence in a competency-based curriculum in dentistry",
  "abstract": "The development of competencies in dentistry is a complicated process that calls for the development of not just cognitive and psychomotor abilities but also behaviors and attitudes that change as technical proficiency increases and meaningful patient encounters occur. This study examined the relationship between the number of clinical requirements completed by dental students and subsequent performance on tests of competence. The null hypothesis stated there would be no significant linear relationship different from zero between absolute clinical requirements and grades attained in various tests of clinical competence.Retrospective assessment data for 81 students were used in this analysis. Data included the amounts of clinical requirements completed for operative dentistry, endodontics, periodontics, and fixed prosthodontics together with data on the respective performance in tests of competence. Correlation was ascertained between grades for tests of competence and the corresponding clinical requirements using a non-parametric Spearman's Rho test at an alpha level of 0.05.Fixed prosthodontics and posterior endodontics were the least common procedures completed by dental students. Statistically significant weak correlations were found between the amounts of clinical requirements performed for posterior endodontic(p = 0.005) and operative procedures (p = 0.006) and associated performance in tests of competence. A moderate correlation was found between the number of fixed prosthodontic procedures completed and associated performance in tests of competence. This latter correlation, however, was not statistically significant (p = 0.654). A significant weak correlation was found between requirements completed for periodontics and the associated test of competence (p = 0.04). A highly statistically significant moderate correlation was found between clinical requirements for anterior endodontics and the associated performance in the tests of competence (p < 0.001).The null hypothesis was rejected since a positive correlation was found between the absolute clinical requirements completed and grades in tests of competence. However, only a weak to moderate degree of correlation was found between the completion of clinical requirements and performance in tests of competence for common clinical procedures that new dental graduates should be able to perform.",
