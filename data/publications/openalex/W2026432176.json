Randomized trials, meta-analyses, and economic studies have evaluated myriad management strategies directed at the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the macrovascular and microvascular sequelae of diabetes. Accordingly, diabetes mellitus is an ideal condition for evidence-based disease management (1, 2).A decision analysis reported in this issue focuses on prevention of diabetic nephropathy [3]. Golan and colleagues address this question: In patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus, what is the relative impact on quality-adjusted life ...References1.
