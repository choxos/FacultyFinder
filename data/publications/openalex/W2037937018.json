  "title": "Toward a More Thoughtful Professional Education for Social Studies Teachers: Can Problem-Based Learning Contribute?",
  "abstract": "Abstract The data presented here show that prospective social studies teachers perceived Problem-Based Learning to provide a significantly more thoughtful learning environment than their other university level experiences. The results can be explained, at least in part, by PBL's capacity to overcome barriers to thoughtful teaching and learning identified in previous research. If social studies teachers are to provide thoughtful classrooms for their students then their own professional education must provide them with appropriate models to emulate and it is proposed that PBL might well constitute one such model.",
