  "abstract": "This article presents a critical review of the literature on the relationship between linguisticliterary education and technology.The aim of the foresaid review is to elucidate the relevant research experiences on this subject, based on the demonstrated hypothesis in the conclusions that academic writing, due to its current complexity, must necessarily be worked with the strategic sustenance of the new technologies of the Knowledge Society.As proof, a methodology of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) is used for the investigation of diverse scientific researches focused on the study of different digital production tools of academic texts which are useful for the access to and communication about scientific knowledge.To sum up, this theoretical analysis provides lecturers and university students with up-to-date knowledge of those digital media that have been proven to be effective from an epistemic and didactic point of view to contribute to the development of the academic writing competence in Higher Education.",
