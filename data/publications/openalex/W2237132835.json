  "title": "Air quality and health education to increase knowledge and encourage health protective behaviour among older adults in Hamilton, Canada",
  "abstract": "Air pollution exposure is detrimental to population health and particularly to older adults (≥65 years of age) who are considered part of the “at-risk” population. The Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) provides air quality and health information such that the public can implement health protective behaviour and decrease exposure to outdoor air pollution. The AQHI education session for older adults aims to increase knowledge, encourage use of the AQHI, and gain a better understanding of how at-risk populations self-identify. An AQHI education session was delivered face-to-face to older adults living independently in Hamilton, Canada. A pre- and post-test questionnaire with both quantitative and qualitative questions was administered to measure knowledge and intention to use AQHI. A total of 62 participants attended the education session and completed the pre- and post-test questionnaire. Results of a paired t test indicated a statistically significant difference in pre- and post-test knowledge (p &lt;0.05). After the education session, 82% of participants indicated their intention to use AQHI. The benefit of using AQHI included health protection while the most relevant barrier was the inability to self-identify as belonging to the elderly at-risk population. An AQHI education session was effective in increasing AQHI knowledge and encouraging use of the AQHI. Consideration must be given to replacing the current terminology “elderly” with the use of chronological age (≥65 years) to describe the at-risk population and foster greater ability to self-identify and use AQHI. Extra attention must be given to engage older adults living in lower socioeconomic areas to address health disparities.",
