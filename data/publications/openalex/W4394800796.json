The primary treatment options for SRMs include surgical excision, ablative therapy, and active surveillance (AS). Low metastatic potential and indolent growth of the SRMs suggest the possible merit of AS over the more aggressive alternatives. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine mortality and oncologic outcomes within five years after partial nephrectomy (PN), percutaneous thermal ablation (PTA), and AS, aiming to provide additional evidence for treatment selection. METHODS: We conducted a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL up until June 2023 and identified additional studies based on recommendations from two expert urologists and hand searching. We addressed 5-year estimates of overall mortality, cancer specific mortality, local recurrence, metastasis, and for patients under AS, number of patients with tumor progression, and number who progressed and underwent invasive treatment, and tumor growth rate. Pairs of reviewers independently undertook eligibility assessment, data abstraction and risk of bias (RoB) assessment. We used QUIPS assessment tool to assess RoB and the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence. We calculated pooled outcomes using DerSimonian-Laird random effects inverse variance method. RESULTS: The 41 studies that proved eligible included 8,234 patients. Overall mortality after PN was 3.7% (95% CI: 2.2 - 6.3, low certainty evidence); for PTA 10.4% (95% CI: 7.8 - 13.6, moderate certainty); and for AS 8.4% (95% CI: 5.1 - 13.4, very low certainty). Cancer specific mortality after PN was 1.8% (95% CI: 1.1 - 2.0, moderate certainty); for PTA 1.3% (95% CI: 0.8 - 2.1, high certainty); and for AS, was 1.5% (95% CI: 0.8 - 2.8, moderate certainty). Local recurrence after PN was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.9 - 4.5, moderate certainty) and for PTA 6.1% (95% CI: 4.1 - 8.8, moderate quality). Cancer metastasis after PN was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.1 - 4.7, high certainty), for PTA 1.9% (95% CI: 1.3 - 2.9, high certainty); and for AS 1.2% (95% CI: 0.7 - 2.2, moderate certainty). Tumor progression for AS was 19.6% (95% CI: 13.4 - 27.7, low certainty). The estimation of change from AS to an active intervention was 11.4% (95% CI: 7.7 - 16.6, low certainty). Tumor growth rate was 0.15 cm/y (95% CI: 0.08-0.21, moderate certainty). CONCLUSIONS: The results of our systematic review and meta-analysis provide the best available estimates of long-term outcomes after PN, PTA, and AS in patients with SRMs, reflecting current patient selection and practice patterns.
