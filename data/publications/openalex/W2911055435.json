A sample of 161 respondents was chosen through convenience sampling technique. The data were collected from employees working in the tertiary care hospital. Methodology: The data collection tools will be used for this project are Supervisory Support Scale (SSS) and demographic variables developed by McGilton in 2010.Demographic variable: Demographic variable involves Age, Gender, Experience, Qualification, and Department. Supervisory Support Scale (SSS): The 15-items likert scale will be used to collect data from nurses who are working in critical care unit. The nurses will require indicating their opinions by circle from 1=Never, 2=Seldom, 3=occasionally, 4=Often, 5=Always (McGilton, 2010). Dependent tool: A clinical decision-making questionnaire with a scale of 27 items was used to collect data. Clinical decision making scale: A clinical decision-making scale of 27 items will used to assess the frequency of decision-making. Each item had a four-point likert scale (1 = Never: 2= rarely; 3 = Sometimes; 4= Always) (Austin, 2010). Results: Pearson Correlation analysis and Multiple Linear Regression analysis were used to test the hypotheses. The results revealed employees\" working performance was positively influenced by directive, supportive, participative and achievement-oriented leadership styles. Results: positive linear correlation between Supervisory Support Scale and Nurses decisions at clinical area and the p=.155. Conclusion: Majority of the nurses in critical care units are females and most lie in the age bracket of23 to 40 years. More than half of the nurses in critical care units have professional qualifications of diploma in general nursing and above and majority is appointed at registered nurse levels. There is moderate decision-making among nurses and that acquiring CVP readings, collecting bronchial cultures and conducting history taking & performing physical examination scored the highest as the decisions most commonly made and performed.
