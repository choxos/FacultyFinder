  "abstract": "ABSTRACT Assessment of perceived social support and received social support available to victims of violent and non-violent crime is considered an integral function of the ensuing well-being for those victims. This study examines the effects of perceived and received social support on the initial levels of distress, coping strategy and subsequent well-being. A cross-sectional survey collected self-report data from personal interviews with 175 victims of crime. Findings indicate a direct relationship between levels of perceived social support and anger. A direct relationship was also found between received social support and anxiety. There was an inverse relationship between social support and emotion-focused coping and avoidance-oriented coping and a significant positive relationship between social support and problem-focused coping.",
