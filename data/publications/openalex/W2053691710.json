  "title": "Effect of Er:YAG Laser Combined With rhPDGF‚ÄêBB on Attachment of Cultured Fibroblasts to Periodontally Involved Root Surfaces",
  "abstract": "The use of the erbium-doped:yttrium, aluminum, and garnet (Er:YAG) laser in periodontal therapy has been the focus of much research. Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-BB (rhPDGF-BB) is suggested as a potent stimulator and strong mitogen for human periodontal ligament cells. The present study tested the direct effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation, alone or with rhPDGF-BB application, on the biocompatibility of periodontally diseased roots through fibroblast attachment and proliferation.The study examined five healthy and 15 periodontally involved teeth, prepared from proximal surfaces, which were divided randomly into four groups (10 specimens each): group 1: healthy; group 2: untreated diseased; group 3: Er:YAG laser irradiation (60 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz); and group 4: Er:YAG laser irradiation (60 mJ/pulse, 10 Hz) plus rhPDGF-BB application (50 ng/ml). Three subgroups per group (three specimens each) were incubated for three periods (1, 3, or 7 days). The remaining specimen was used to determine surface topography. Fibroblasts were pooled on root specimens and incubated. Results were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy. Repeated cell counts were performed within a representative standard area.Using paired t tests, all experimental groups (except group 2 diseased) showed statistically significant differences between 1- and 3-day and between 1- and 7-day incubation periods, but not between 3- and 7-day incubation periods. Using analysis of variance, the intergroup comparison showed significant differences favoring group 1 over groups 2 and 3 and group 4 over group 2 at the 1-day incubation period; group 1 was favored over groups 2, 3, and 4 and groups 3 and 4 were favored over group 2 at the 3- and 7-day incubation periods. Comparable effects were shown between groups 3 and 4 for all incubation periods and between groups 2 and 3 and groups 1 and 4 for the 1-day incubation.Er:YAG laser used alone or in combination with rhPDGF-BB application may offer a promising periodontal therapy for conditioning root surfaces, although the combined application seemed to be slightly more effective. However, testing laser use in intervals and with parameters <60 mJ/pulse and 10 Hz is required to verify the minimum threshold values necessary to obtain complete root debridement and clarify optimal conditions for fibroblast cell attachment and growth. Further studies are needed to determine ideal parameters for creating the best environment for successful periodontal treatment.",
