Successful sperm retrieval may be dependent on a laboratory-based meticulous search when sperm are not identified in the operating room (OR). Here we report the chance of sperm discovery in the laboratory when sperm were not identified in the OR. METHODS For 1,054 men with nonobstructive azoospermia who underwent microdissection TESE, testicular tissue samples were minced, passed through a 24 gauge angiocatheter and examined in the operating room by an experienced laboratory andrologist using test slides. In cases where no sperm was seen in the OR, the extracted tissue was digested in 1% collagenase for 1 hour at 37°C and re-analyzed using a microdroplet approach with Nomarski optics. Patient parameters such as age, testicular volume, serum FSH, Klinefelter syndrome (KS), varicocele, histological characteristics, and pregnancy rates were analyzed relative to the chance of sperm identification in the laboratory. RESULTS Of the 1054 men, sperm were found in the OR in 52.5%. Of the 501 men for whom sperm was not found in the OR, sperm were found in the lab for 35 (7%) patients. Clinical parameters did not differ between men for whom sperm were found in the lab but not the OR and men in whom no sperm were found. Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were not different whether the sperm was found in the OR or the lab. For men with no sperm but germ cells present in testicular tissue, the chance of finding sperm in the lab was 16%. When no germ cells were present and no sperm seen in the OR, 4.3% of the men eventually had sperm in lab. Interestingly, men with FSH > 20 had a greater chance of sperm being found later in the laboratory than men with normal FSH values, but this higher chance was restricted to men with germ cells present. CONCLUSIONS In men undergoing microdissection TESE, testicular sperm were usually observed both in the operating room as well as in the lab. However, in up to 7% of the men, the embryologist found sperm even when sperm had not been observed in the OR. This was most often observed in men with germ cells seen intra-operatively and FSH > 20 U/L. This information will be valuable in counseling patients on the chance of finding sperm when it is not found intra-operatively.
