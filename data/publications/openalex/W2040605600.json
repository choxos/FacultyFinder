  "title": "Importance of predation by groundfish, marine mammals and birds on walleye pollock Theragra chaicogramma and Pacific herring Clupea pallasi in the eastern Bering Sea",
  "abstract": "Consumption of walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma and Pacific herring Clupea pallasi by groundfish predators in the eastern Bering Sea was quantified and described using data obtained in 1985-88.Groundfish predators considered here include walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma; Pacific cod Gadus macrocephalus; yellowfin sole Pleuronectes asper; flathead sole Hippoglossoides elassodon; rock sole Pleuronectes bilineatus; Alaska plaice Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus; arrowtooth flounder Atheresthes stornias; and Greenland turbot Reinhardtius hippoglossoides.Marine mammal and bird consumption of pollock and herring was estimated for 1985 and compared with groundfish consumption.Groundfish predation on pollock during this time period was dominated by cannibalism on age-0 pollock by adult pollock.The highest predation rate occurred in 1985 when the largest pollock year class, as assessed at age 1, during the time period was produced.Predation mortality estimates by age on the 1985 year class were higher than adjacent year classes.Apparently, predators responded to the increased abundance of the 1985 pollock year class by switching to predation on that year class.The impact of this predation appeared to dampen the size of the 1985 year class at age 3 relative to other adjacent year classes.Marine mammal and bird predation on pollock was small relative to pollock cannibalism.However, marine mammal predation on older pollock was more important, almost doubling the estimated predation mortality rate of age-2 fish.Herring consumption by groundfish predators tended to be sporadic in time and space and may have depended on encounter rates of herring schools rather than overall biomass.Pacific cod was the most consistent groundfish predator on herring.There was no apparent relationship between biomass of herring consumed by groundfish predators and cohort analysis estimates of herring biomass in a given year, suggesting no density-dependent predator response.Marine mammal and bird predation on herring was approximately the same as that by groundfish in terms of weight and about half in terms of numbers.Total predation removals of herring were not large relative to exploitable stock size, indicating that predation of juvenile herring, at least during summer periods typically sampled, was not an important source of herring mortality.",
