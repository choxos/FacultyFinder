  "title": "Made in Ireland: studies in popular music",
  "abstract": "In 2017, journalist David Forsythe posed the question \"what have the Irish ever done for us?\"As he went on to demonstrate through his stories of Irish people who have made their mark in the fields of science and engineering, quite a lot!And that is undoubtedly the case too when it comes to music, as Mangaoang, O'Flynn and Ó Briain so expertly demonstrate in Made in Ireland.Bringing together a range of interdisciplinary scholars, Made in Ireland is the first dedicated collection of essays on Irish popular music from the post-WW2 period to the present day.As the editors state in the book's introduction, the \"assumed musicality\" of the Irish has often hindered the \"recognition and status of domestic popular musicmaking\" and downplayed \"individual agency and particular (sub-)scenes and local networks\" (10).Made in Ireland firmly addresses these points with its all-encompassing focus on the \"reproduction, appropriation and development of global musical-cultural movements and phenomena in local and national contexts\" (3), as well as the \"hybridities and other points of intersection\" (3) between international music genres and traditional Irish music practices.This makes it an up-to-date, comprehensive and inclusive volume that injects dynamism into the growing area of Irish musicology and offers new approaches, understandings and theoretical paradigms onto the activities and perspectives of domestic music producers, mediators, distributors and consumers on the island of Ireland, as well as aspects of performance and reception that spread to Britain and other Anglophone countries through the Irish diaspora.",
