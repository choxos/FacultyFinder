  "title": "Air Purification in Highly-Urbanized Areas with Use TiO<sub>2</sub>: New Approach to Design the Urban Public Space to Benefit Human Condition",
  "abstract": "Abstract This paper deal with the possibilities of architectural design to benefit human condition, which encompasses physical well-being, environmental quality of life in highly-urbanized areas. Nowadays, the urban pollution is rising on a global scale. The paper is focused on a new possibility to resolve the problem of air purification in big cities by advanced architectural design public use spaces in the urban environment. The first part of the paper depicts possible usage of Titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) technology - nanoparticles of TiO 2 , as a building materials component. These components are the latest findings in the field of nanomaterials development, and their effectiveness due to the usage of the photocatalysis, which depends on eliminating various atmospheric pollutants and especially clearing the atmosphere from nitrogen oxides. These components together with calcium carbonate to neutralize any acidic gasses that may be adsorbed. Photoactive construction materials are mainly activated under UV light irradiation. The second part presents the results of the research program Climate Change Adapted Architecture and Building Structures which has been conducted by Krystyna Januszkiewicz (the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Architecture for a few years at West Pomeranian University of Technology (WPUT) in Szczecin. The presented designs were developed with co-operation, Magdalena Janus and Kamila Bogacz (Institute of Chemical and Environmental Engineering) as applications samples of titanium dioxide technology (photocatalytic active building materials) in the urban space. In conclusion, the paper emphasizes the usage of titanium technology, as a construction materials component such as concrete and gypsum or a component of active membrane fabrics opens a new way in architecture and structure designing in the urban public space. This is indispensable to improve citizensâ€™ health and to clear the atmosphere from nitrogen oxides or the volatile organic compounds and serves also as the basis to newly-built communities.",
