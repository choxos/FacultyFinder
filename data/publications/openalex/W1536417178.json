  "title": "The distribution and density of the squirrel glider (Petaurus Norfolcensis) on islands in southeast Queensland",
  "abstract": "The distribution of the squirrel glider (Petaurus norfolcensis) extends for 3,000 kilometres along the eastern coast of Australia.Human-induced habitat loss and fragmentation is a major factor resulting in the decline in distribution of this species.Records indicate the presence of the squirrel glider on a number of the islands off the coast of southeast Queensland, where the threatening processes of fragmented mainland habitat are reduced or absent.The main aims of this study were to determine the presence of the squirrel glider on southeast Queensland islands, and to estimate the density of these populations to determine whether there is any difference in density between island and mainland populations.Trapping surveys were conducted on Fraser Island, Moreton Island, North Stradbroke Island, Peel Island, South Stradbroke Island, Woogoompah Island and Coomera Island.Surveys were also conducted in three mainland patches.Results of the study confirmed that the squirrel glider exists on five of the seven islands.Density estimates for island populations ranged between 3.01 and 8.48 individuals ha' with an average (+ s.e.) of 4.94 + 0.55 individuals ha''.Island population densities were not significantly different from mainland populations, which had an average density (+ s.e.) of 4.12 + 0.53 individuals ha'.Overall, the study provided up-to-date records for the squirrel glider on islands in southeast Queensland, as well as new information on population densities in this species.Results highlight the importance of retaining large areas of bushland (>700 ha) on the mainland to ensure the long-term persistence of populations of the squirrel glider.",
