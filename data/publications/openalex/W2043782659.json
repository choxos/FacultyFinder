Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established marker for monitoring PC patients (pts). However, correlative information on PSA and SRE risks and the effects of ZOL on PSA kinetics is currently limited. Therefore, exploratory analyses of the ZOL phase III trial database were performed. METHODS In the phase III trial of ZOL (Saad et al. JNCI. 2002/2004), CRPC pts with bone metastases (mets; N = 643) were randomized to ZOL or placebo (PBO) q 3 wk. PSA levels during the first 3 mo on study were evaluated in linear and logarithmic (log) models. Relative risks (RR) of SREs, bone disease progression (BDP), and death were calculated per 1 log (ng/mL) PSA increase. PSA kinetics models were stratified using prognostic factors established in the ZOL phase III trial (Cook et al. CCR. 2006) and a CRPC nomogram (Halabi et al. JCO. 2003). Time-dependent PSA values were carried forward for up to 168 days. Baseline PSA models used the study median (PSA 77.3 ng/mL) as the high/low cutpoint. RESULTS Baseline PSA data were available for 434 ZOL- and 202 PBO-treated pts. In multivariate linear models of PSA kinetics over the first 3 mo, PSA velocity (coefficient of time in model for log[PSA] vs time) ranged from 0.134–0.155 log(ng/mL)/mo (ZOL) and 0.148–0.188 log(ng/mL)/mo (PBO), with no statistically significant treatment difference. In the overall population (n = 636), PSA increases correlated with significantly increased risks of death (RR = 1.596), BDP (RR = 1.159), and first SRE (RR = 1.264; RRs are for 1 log [ng/mL] increase; P < .0001 for all). The associated increases in BDP risk per 1 log (ng/mL) PSA increase were RR = 1.097 (ZOL) and RR = 1.295 (PBO). The cumulative incidence of SREs was lower overall for ZOL vs PBO. Pts with high baseline PSA had higher SRE risks in both groups (RR = 2.03 for PBO and 1.40 for ZOL). CONCLUSIONS PSA is an important prognostic tool for survival in the CRPC bone mets setting, and these analyses showed that PSA is also prognostic for BDP and SREs. Consistent with its bone-protective effects, ZOL reduced the risk of SREs. Further analyses of PSA progression in earlier PC settings are planned. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 185Issue 4SApril 2011Page: e288 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Fred Saad Montréal, Canada More articles by this author Jose Perez Florham Park, NJ More articles by this author Richard Cook Waterloo, Canada More articles by this author Scott Segal Florham Park, NJ More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
