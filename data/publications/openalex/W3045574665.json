  "title": "Knowing Male Subjects: Globally Mobile Chinese Professionals and the Aesthetics of the Confucian Sublime",
  "abstract": "This article probes the sources, manifestations, and significances of the ambivalences and contradictions in London-based Chinese middle-class male professionals' sense of their own gendered and cultural identities in the context of China's twenty-first century postsocialist modernity. In doing so, it shows how Chinese middle-class men's sense of themselves connects with wider national debates about China's orientation in the world. To make sense of the desire of some respondents \"to become a Chinese gentleman,\" the article introduces the notion of the postsocialist Confucian sublime, a vision of a cultural order of increasing appeal to well-educated, middle-class Chinese men. The article argues that the Confucian sublime offers globally mobile professional Chinese men the opportunity to transcend their ambivalence towards Western modernity by providing a sense of wholeness and attainment both at a personal level and in relating to China's place in contemporary globality.",
