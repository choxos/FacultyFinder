It is imperative that hospitals decrease SSI rates to reduce patient morbidity and healthcare costs. Additionally, SSI rate will become a quality metric that is released to the public and will affect reimbursement for hospitals. We aimed to reduce our superficial surgical site infection rate following major urologic surgery by implementing a simple operative room bundle. METHODS A simple operative room bundle was applied to all urologic cases with an abdominal incision at a single tertiary referral center. The bundle included allowing skin prep to dry appropriately, changing gloves prior to skin closure, irrigating the wound prior to skin closure and using a new separate sterile closing instrument set for skin closure. Alcohol-based preps were also introduced hospital-wide three months into the study period. The SSI rate was obtained from the NSQIP (National Surgical Quality Improvement Program) database. RESULTS The SSI rate was assessed after a 14-month study period for a total of 524 cases. Prior to instituting alcohol-based prep, 143 cases for which the bundle was implemented were analyzed over a 3-month period with an SSI rate of 0%, supporting its continued use. With both the alcohol-based prep and infection prevention bundle in place, the infection rate was 1.3% (7/524) as compared to 3.4% (22/651) for the 13-month period prior to bundle introduction, a statistically significant reduction (p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS The SSI rate after major urologic surgery at one center was reduced after the introduction of a simple, fast and cost-effective bundle into the operating room. The reduction may have been in part due to the introduction of alcohol-based preps hospital-wide during the study period. Use of this bundle reduces SSI which is critical for the patient and the physician in this era of public reporting and reimbursement based on outcomes. © 2016FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 195Issue 4SApril 2016Page: e239-e240 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2016MetricsAuthor Information Sarah Vij More articles by this author Ganesh Kartha More articles by this author Venkatesh Krishnamurthi More articles by this author Howard B Goldman More articles by this author Michelle Ponziano More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
