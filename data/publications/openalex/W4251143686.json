  "abstract": "Coaches' verbal aggressiveness is an influential behavioral trait that influences athletes' perception and feelings.Similarly, coaches' leadership behavior affects athletes' perceptions, feelings and performance.Examining behavioral patterns independent from each other is a descriptive approach.Extracting profiles as combinations of such patterns is expected to be more explanatory and insightful.The aim of the present study was: a) to explore the perceived leadership style and verbal aggressiveness profile of coaches and b) to examine differences in athletes' satisfaction and achievement goal orientation based on the perceived coaches' leadership style and verbal aggressiveness profile.The findings of a two-stage cluster analysis supported two profiles of coaches.The first profile depicts coaches exhibiting a low autocratic, high democratic and low verbal aggressive behavior.The second profile includes coaches presenting a high autocratic, low democratic and high verbal aggressive behavior.Teachers categorized within the first profile promoted their athletes' satisfaction.Similarly, athletes who are more task-oriented consider that their coaches belong to the first profile.Coaches could adopt a democratic leadership style and exhibit less verbally aggressive behaviour for promoting athletes satisfaction.",
