  "title": "A Measure of the Impact on Real-Time Patient Care of Evidence-based Medicine Logs",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is a critical skill for physicians, and EBM competency has been shown to increase implementation of best medical practices, reduce medical errors, and increase patient-centered care. Like any skill, EBM must be practiced, receiving iterative feedback to improve learners’ comprehension. Having residents document patient interactions in logbooks to allow for residency program review, feedback, and documentation of competency has been previously described as a best practice within emergency medicine (EM) to document practice-based learning (PBL) competency. Quantifying how residents use the information they query, locate, evaluate, and apply while providing direct patient care can measure the efﬁcacy of EBM education and provide insight into more efﬁcient ways of providing medical care. Methods: Practice-based learning logs were surveys created to record resident EBM activity on-shift and were placed into our residency management software program. Residents were required to submit 3–5 surveys of EBM activity performed during a 28-day rotation during which additional information was sought. This study included all PBL logs completed by EM residents from June 1, 2013–May 11, 2020. Using qualitative methodology, a codebook was created to analyze residents’ free-text responses to the prompt: “Based on your research, would you have done anything differently?” The codebook was designed to generate a three-digit code conveying the effect of the researched information on the patient about whom the log was written, as well as whether the information would affect future patient care and whether these decisions were based on scientiﬁc evidence. Results: A total of 10,574 logs were included for primary analysis. In total, 1,977 (18.7%) logs indicated that the evidence acquired through research would affect future patient care. Of these, 392 (3.7%) explicitly stated that the EBM activity conducted as part of our project led to real-time changes in patient care in the ED and would change future management of patients as well. Conclusion: We present a proof of concept that PBL log activity can lead to integration of evidence-based medicine into real-time patient care. While a convenience sample, our cohort recorded evidence of both lifelong learning and application to patient care.",
