  "title": "Anthropometric Measurements of the Facial Framework in Adulthood: Age-Related Changes in Eight Age Categories in 600 Healthy White North Americans of European Ancestry From 16 to 90 Years of Age",
  "abstract": "The aim of this cross-sectional anthropometric study was to determine the age-related changes in the facial framework during adulthood in healthy white North Americans of European ancestry (261 male subjects and 339 female subjects). Five measurements, four horizontal and one vertical, defining the framework were taken from the skin and bony surface of the face in the maturation period (16-20 years) and in 10-year age categories of adulthood (21-90 years). As well, the thickness of the soft-tissue cover between these two anatomical levels was measured. The categories between 21 and 40 years represented early adulthood, those between 41 and 70 years represented middle adulthood, and those between 71 and 90 years represented late adulthood. The forehead width in both sexes increased significantly on the skin and bony surface from the maturation period to early adulthood. In middle adulthood, the changes were significant only sporadically. In late adulthood, the upper and lower jaw showed a harmonious change with age, mostly increasing on both the skin and bony surface. The face width proved to be the most stable measurement and had the thinnest soft-tissue cover. No consistent pattern emerged during adulthood in increases or decreases within the facial framework; however, an unexpected harmony was noted between the values of the measurements in early and late adulthood in both sexes on both the skin and bony surface. The thickness of the soft-tissue cover at the bony landmarks was greatest in the midface, with a moderately decreasing tendency in both sexes. In the lower jaw, the soft tissue showed significant increases in thickness in early adulthood and moderate to large decreases in late adulthood. Anthropometric analysis of the facial framework in adulthood marks only the first step in establishing the morphological changes of the aging face. Quantitative evaluation of changes within the facial framework of the aging population must be carried out in more detail. Increased worldwide migration results in a mixing of people of various racial/ethnic origins and necessitates a general anthropometric analysis of the aging face to provide more reliable guidelines for therapy.",
