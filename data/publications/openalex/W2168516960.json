  "title": "Defining Child Pornography: Law Enforcement Dilemmas in Investigations of Internet Child Pornography Possession<sup>1</sup>",
  "abstract": "Abstract This study examines law enforcement dilemmas in child pornography possession investigations in which no offender was arrested. A mail survey of US law enforcement agencies identified a sample of Internet child pornography possession cases where no arrest was made. Telephone surveys with law enforcement investigators were used to collect case‐specific data and information on dilemmas in these investigations. Law enforcement investigators reported that determining whether or not images fit within statutory limits and ascertaining the age of children in images impacted arrest outcomes in child pornography possession cases.
