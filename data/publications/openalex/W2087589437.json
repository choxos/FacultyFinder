To facilitate this initiative, the ACGME launched the Milestones Project in 2009, charging each specialty to identify \"the milestones of competency development\" (2). Milestones are observable developmental steps that describe progression from a beginning learner to the expected level of proficiency at the completion of training. Accordingly, predefined milestones can be ...References1. Swing SR. The ACGME outcome project: retrospective and prospective. Med Teach. 2007;29:648-54.
