  "abstract": "This thesis presents an overview of the teaching of Cataloging in the Library Science courses of Brazil.The study, which had the Pedagogical Course Projects of 96 disciplines of Cataloging as subject, aimed to analyze the development and historical path of the teaching of Cataloging in Brazil, considering the demands of the contemporary informational unities, the new teaching methodologies, and the incorporation of technological and conceptual innovations on the area of Information Science.The study was based on the assumption that the teaching of Cataloging displays difficulties which relate mainly to the incorporation of technological advances, such as new formats, patterns and functions, on the everyday activities of the classes in the Library Science courses, and that there is an underdevelopment of the Pedagogical Course Projects and of the Education Plans of the discipline in relation to the theoretical/conceptual development of the area.For that purpose, this study, of qualitative nature, included two converging methodological stages.The first was based on bibliographic research, for the establishment of the theoretical framework, and on documental research, covering the collection of data from the Pedagogical Course Projects and the Education Plans of Cataloging.The second stage involved assumptions about the content analysis, in accordance with Bardin (1977), for the study of the curriculum of 87 mandatory disciplines of Cataloging.On this stage, a set of subjects important to the composition of the discipline was built founded on authors of the area, which allowed for the identification, grouping, and categorization of the contents that make up the academic education of librarians.In Brazil, the teaching of Cataloging occurs since the pioneering courses of Library Science, and the search for balance between theory and practice has been present in the discipline throughout history.Nowadays, discussions about new teaching methods are becoming more relevant and active methodologies can add dynamism to the process of teaching and learning of Cataloging by granting students with protagonism, as opposed to the traditional model which is centered on the role of the teacher.The results show that the inclusion of new contents has been happening gradually and on a superficial level, often being limited to the theoretical ideas of the area.Subjects such as Metadata, RDA, and FRBR, which are very indicative of conceptual evolving, still need representation within the subjects of Cataloging in many of the analyzed courses.Similarly, the adoption of new teaching methodologies has also shown to be on its early stages, as the expository classes are the most used methodology in the Cataloging disciplines, which suggests the prevalence of traditional teaching methods.This research intends to contribute to the development of knowledge and comprehension of the current scenario of the teaching of Cataloging in Brazil, as well as provide information for the development of new research on this area.",
