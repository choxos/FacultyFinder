  "title": "Irish Demons: English Writings on Ireland, the Irish, and Gender by Spenser and His Contemporaries",
  "abstract": "The \"Supplication\" and A View of the Present State of Ireland Ireland was England's first colony and remains its last.The 800 years since the first English settlements can be divided into two distinct phases: the first incomplete colonization of the island by twelfth-century Anglo-Norman settlers, and the recolonization in the early modern period.The second phase manifested ruthless determination to succeed where the first phase was deemed to have failed.Plantation as a policy began under Mary 1 with the confiscation of two-thirds of Leix and Offaly, the increasingly lawless regions west of the Pale. 1 English men were encouraged to settle in Leix and Offaly but were forbidden on pain of forfeiture to sell or lease their land to any of Irish blood or birth.Under Elizabeth 1, however, financial frugality dominated.Like her father before her, Elizabeth was reluctant to undertake an expensive policy of state-funded colonization: it would instead become the enterprize of private speculators and adventurers.Two attempts to colonize parts of Ulster-one by Thomas Smith in 1572 and the other by Walter Devereux, Earl of Essex, the year after-failed miserably.Following the fall of the House of Munster an act was passed in 1586 for confiscation of the Earl of Desmond's estates.Among the New English granted land by the crown was the poet and government official Edmund Spenser. 2 In 1580 Spenser had gone to Ireland as secretary to the newly appointed Deputy, Lord Arthur Grey de Wilton.When Grey was recalled, due to the excessive brutality and expense of his Irish policies, Spenser stayed in Ireland and wrote The Faerie Queene.Spenser left when the Munster plantation was overthrown in 1598.Early modern English writings on Ireland frequently display anxieties about gender and use sexual difference as a metaphor for political, ethnic, and religious difference.The demonization of the Irish enemy weaves myths of savagery, including cannibalism, into a matrix of sexual deviance and disease, and transposes this onto the Irish landscape which is figured as menacing.The transition from an uncivilized state to an idealized, subdued condition is imaged as sexual conquest and this movement is evinced in writings by Spenser and his contemporaries.The main chapters of this book explore important ideological concerns at work in The Faerie Queene, concerns that are both reinforced and echoed in a range of early modern English writings on Ireland.As Andrew Hadfield points out \"Spenser's life in Ireland does not mark him out as a particularly unusual Elizabethan writer.There are numerous examples of English writers going to Ireland out of necessity or desire\" (Hadfield 1997, 20).Amongst those listed by Hadfield who \"were connected to the Elizabethan civil service or military, often both\" are Barnaby Rich, John Derricke and John Davies whose opinions on Ireland and the Irish feature in this book.",
