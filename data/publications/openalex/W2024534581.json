  "abstract": "Comment.Most packaged food products do not include potassium content on the NFP.One might expect items with high levels of potassium to more often be labeled; however, categories where potassium information was most available had a wide range of potassium content, while some categories with expected high levels of potassium, such as canned whole tomatoes and canned beans, had low potassium information availability.The lack of potassium information on the NFP presents a problem for patients and consumers trying to make informed decisions when purchasing foods, particularly those motivated to minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease and those for whom potassium intake must be restricted.Lack of potassium information is also a problem for researchers and policy makers interested in understanding the overall and potassium-specific nutritional content of the packaged food supply. 8 The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, along with 35 health authorities and health organizations, has called for a publicly accessible, productspecific nutrition database of packaged food products. 9 The creation of such a database would allow for analyzing nutritional trends, which would inform recommendations to improve nutritional intake.While such a database is valuable with existing NFP information, its public health value would be enhanced if potassium information was consistently available.A limitation of this study is that the NSRI database was originally created to assess changes in sodium concentration; therefore, it includes a wide range of products, but only in food categories with significant potential for sodium reduction (eg, some desserts and beverages are not included).Also, only the top 80% of products sold within each category are represented in the analyses.The FDA is planning to revise the NFP, and potential improvements to its content and format are under consideration. 10The addition of potassium content and percent daily value to required NFP information could remedy the described deficit in publicly available nutrition information.Providing this important information to consumers, patients, and researchers would allow a more detailed understanding of the food supply, which would complement existing strategies to improve population nutritional intake.",
