  "title": "Odor preference and social behavior in meadow voles, <i>Microtus pennsylvanicus</i>: seasonal differences",
  "abstract": "Olfactory cues play a major role in inter- and intra-sexual agonistic behavior for Microtus pennsylvanicus. We show that seasonal changes in odor preference and behavioral interactions coincide with varying patterns of social organization. Odor preference trials were conducted in a Y maze and social behavior was measured in dyadic encounters in a neutral arena. During the breeding season, paired encounters between females contained more agonistic acts than did encounters between males, or those between males and females. Breeding males preferred the odor of females to the odor of conspecific males. In contrast, breeding females preferred their own odor and the odor of males to the odor of other females. The data support female exclusiveness during the breeding season. During the nonbreeding season, paired encounters between females contained fewer agonistic acts than did encounters between males or those between males and females. Nonbreeding females preferred the odor of female conspecifics to their own odor or the odor of male conspecifics. These results are consistent with group nesting and a relaxation of female territoriality during the nonbreeding season. Nonbreeding males did not exhibit a preference for their own odor, the odor of other males, or the odor of female conspecifics. Our results indicate that nonbreeding males are solitary, and overwintering groups are female-biased. Odor preferences may underlie seasonal changes in social organization.",
