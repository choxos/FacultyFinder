  "title": "Calligraphy and Architecture in the Muslim World",
  "abstract": "Explores the myriad interactions between calligraphy and architecture throughout the history of the Muslim world 30 case studies explain different aspects and contexts of calligraphy in Islamic architecture Geographically wide-ranging – covers North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, China and Spain Takes an interdisciplinary approach to analysing calligraphy as part of its larger spatial-architectural context Lavishly illustrated with over 300 colour images From Spain to China, Islamic architecture and calligraphy are inexorably intertwined. Mosques, dervish lodges, mausolea, libraries, even baths and market places bear masterpieces of calligraphy that rival the most refined of books and scrolls.This major reference work focuses on architectural inscriptions through the Muslim world, from the emergence of Islam to the present day. What were the purposes of these inscriptions? How do they infuse buildings with culturally specific meanings, sacred or profane? What do they add to architectural design? What sorts of materials were used, and how do they interact with light and space? Who were their patrons, and what do we know about the artists who produced them? Find out with this exciting new collection edited by a stellar cast of international contributors.
