Mayer and Deanne Adams Discussant: Robert Atkinson (rich.mayer@psych.ucsb.edu) University of California, Santa Barbara (Robert.Atkinson@asu.edu) Arizona State University Tetris™ is the video game most used as a research paradigm by the Cognitive Science community (Mayer, in press). Collectively, the members of this symposium have and are using Tetris to study several phenomena that we each believe is just slightly out of reach but in sight of contempo- rary cognitive theory. • Focusing on the cognitive consequences of Tetris play, Mayer and Adams will examine claims for general transfer from Tetris to executive functions, reasoning, and memory skills. • Turning Tetris into an instructional paradigm, Skinner and Johnson explore intriguing data suggesting that the synchronization of instructor and student EEGs is cor- related with successful student learning. Figure 1. Tetris™ • Struck by the extreme expertise exemplified by the best Tetris players (e.g., watch this video – death- scout8, 2014) Lindstedt turns to AI-based models to explore the parameter space of features and feature weights that allow us to classify a human move as good or bad. Symposium Presentations The symposium will feature an introduction by Perez, fol- lowed by four talks, a short discussion, and then by a 20 min QandA among panel members and the audience. Cognitive Consequences of Playing Tetris: A Research Review – Richard E. Mayer and Deanne Adams Mayer and Adams will review research on the cognitive consequences of playing Tetris (Mayer, in press). One of the major methodologies in game research is the cognitive con- sequences approach (Mayer, 2011) which compares changes in the cognitive skills of a group that plays an off-the-shelf computer game for an extended period of time (game group) versus a group that does not play the game (comparison group). On the positive side, playing Tetris has been shown to have a substantial effect on 2D mental rotation of Tetris-like shapes (d = 0.82 based on 6 comparisons) and a moderate • Realizing the Yogi Berra maxim that, “You can see a lot by just looking”, Gray examines the use of eyes in Tetris and relates the findings to the Cognitive Science issue of Epistemic Action (Kirsh & Maglio, 1994). • Finally, skeptical as always, VanLehn (our Discussant) will begin the discussion by questioning the transfer of results from Tetris to other task domains.
