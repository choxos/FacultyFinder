  "title": "Ghosts Across Borders: Don Juan de Castro and his Grateful Dead",
  "abstract": "El mejor amigo el muerto (co-written by Luis Belmonte Bermúdez, Francisco de Rojas, and Pedro Calderón de la Barca) and Don Juan de Castro (by Lope de Vega) both follow the same basic plot; they tell the story of Don Juan, a Spaniard, who is shipwrecked in England. Each play then follows the folktale of the Grateful Dead: a dead man’s burial rituals are first neglected by those who should perform them and then carried out by Don Juan, a stranger, thereby indebting him to the living man. The dead man’s ghost returns to save Don Juan’s life and help him find love and rise to power in England. Multiple meetings of worlds occur in these plays. The first is the encounter of the living with the dead; the second is the confrontation between the Spanish and the English. Importantly, caring contact across one border (that of living and dead) is what allows the success of the other connection (of the English and Spanish). This paper examines the interplay between these two dichotomous contacts to understand this story’s attitudes towards borders, crossings, and the necessity of compassionate contact between oppositional worlds.",
