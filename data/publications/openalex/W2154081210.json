We investigated whether use of phi (as compared to total PSA and % fPSA) can reduce unnecessary biopsy and over-detection of indolent PCa while improving the detection of histo-pathologically aggressive PCa. METHODS 658 men met inclusion criteria for analysis of clinically significant PCa as an endpoint in a multi-center prospective clinical trial. All men had a biopsy confirmed diagnosis, a final PSA between 4-10 ng/mL, were 50 years or older and had a benign rectal examination (DRE). We evaluated prediction of clinically significant cancer (aggressive histopathology per Epstein criteria or Gleason 7+) based on pre-biopsy measures of [-2]proPSA, total PSA, fPSA, %fPSA and phi. We evaluated prospects for eliminating unnecessary biopsy based on results of phi prior to biopsy. RESULTS At 90% sensitivity the specificity of phi was 31.1%, compared to 19.8% for %fPSA (p = 0.024) and 10.8% for PSA (p < 0.001). At phi from 27 to 55 the probability of cancer ranged from 9.8 to 50.1%, and of clinically significant cancer from 3.9% to 28.9. Increasing phi values were associated with higher biopsy Gleason score (GS) (p trend < 0.01), and significant cancer based on Epstein criteria (p = 0.009). Among men with pre-biopsy phi < 27, the number of aggressive or significant cancers in our study was consistently very low based on either the Epstein criteria (11/137, 8.0%), GS > 3+4 (4/137, 2.9%), or GS > 4+3 (1/137, 0.7%). Only 1 of 35 (2.9%) cancers having GS 4+3 or worse had a phi < 27. At the 90% sensitivity cut-point for phi (phi=27), 120/639 (18.8%) men (104 biopsy negative for cancer and 16 with clinically insignificant cancer) could have been spared from undergoing prostate biopsy or over-diagnosis of non-aggressive disease. CONCLUSIONS phi outperformed PSA and %fPSA in predicting the presence of clinically significant PCa and for improving PCa detection. Using phi=27 for selecting men for PCa biopsy when total PSA is 4 to 10 ng/mL, can mitigate unnecessary biopsies and reduce over-detection of indolent PCa. © 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 189 Issue 4S April 2013 Page: e843 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2013 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.Metrics Author Information Martin Sanda Boston, MA More articles by this author John Wei Ann Arbor, MI More articles by this author Dennis Broyles Brea, CA More articles by this author Sanhuk Shin Brea, CA More articles by this author Alan Partin Baltimore, MD More articles by this author George Klee Rochester, MN More articles by this author Chris Bangma Rotterdam, Netherlands More articles by this author Kevin Slawin Houston, TX More articles by this author Leonard Marks Los Angeles, CA More articles by this author Amabelle Cruz Brea, CA More articles by this author Isaac Mizrahi Brea, CA More articles by this author Dan Chan Baltimore, MD More articles by this author Lori Sokoll Baltimore, MD More articles by this author Ron H.N. van Schaik Rotterdam, Netherlands More articles by this author Stacy Loeb New York, NY More articles by this author William Catalona Chicago, IL More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
