  "title": "Effect of using Core Stability training on the defense effectiveness against Waist Turnover in fight position from blow for Wrestlers",
  "abstract": "Allen & kip (2002) adds that among the most significant benefits from practicing the training of strengthening the core muscle is the increase of movement efficiency for the body during the practice of sports and daily activities, as it also helps on increasing the body stability in the core and hip and also increasing control in body and balance during movement.(11:41) Aisha Abdul-Mawla and Iman Suleiman (2013) indicate that core stability training focuses on strength movements with multiple dimensions, which needs multiple muscles in order to work together to obtain the maximum training return on contrary to the common from programs, which rely on the independent muscle performance.They also see that attention shall be paid to the development of central muscles, which support the spine and core, where the deep muscles work with visible surface muscles in harmony to support and stabilize the spine, whereas when the core is properly stabilized during the performance of sport skills, the stress falling on the back is alleviated ad makes the body moves with more freedom.(5:262) Willardson ( 2008) sees that the application of core stability training contributes in raising the athletic performance by providing the basis, upon which the upper and lower parts rely in contraction to accelerate or slow the movements of body parts.( 43)The research problem takes shape in that through the researcher practice of wrestling sport as a player then a trainer and follow-up on local and international tournaments, he found failure in defense against waist turnover from below for most players, which make them exposed to loss, when they reach this position, whether during the fight or by regulation due to negativity or warning.Despite that some players, who mater defense against waist turnover, take this position as a truce for rest and benefit therefrom in converting defense into offence and obtain technical points and the reason for that returns to a failure in training on this position, its physical requirements, and deficiency in the level of strength type required by this position, as well as the used training methods and techniques, which do not factor into account the working muscles and its requirements in performance, whereas through the researcher experience, analysis, and utilizing the opinions of experts in wrestling sport, he found that position of body in defense against the waist turnover requires maximum strength that supersede the competitor strength and the strength exists in the form of stable muscle contraction and that called the researchers to design a program by using core stability training, which would develop the muscle strength related to the core area through stable muscle contraction, which is similar in its performance technique with defense against waist turnover from the fighting position from below.ï‚· Research objectives: Designing a training program by using core stability training for the purpose of: -1-Identifying the extent of the training program effect on the strength variables affecting the defense performance against waist turnover for the experimental group individuals.2-Identifying the effect of the training program on the effectiveness of defense against the waist turnover for the experimental group individuals.",
