  "title": "Experimentalism: Self-Reflexive and Postmodernist Stories",
  "abstract": "'The short story is a young art', wrote Elizabeth Bowen in 1937: 'as we know it', she contends, 'it is the child of this century'. It sounds curious to think of short fiction as still in its infancy or at least early adolescence by mid-century, when we recall the form's earlier trailblazers such as Thomas Hardy, Henry James and, of course, Edgar Allan Poe. Bowen must therefore have had some other context of generic transformation in mind, one that affects the story 'as we know it' now, rather than as it has come to be known and traditionally valued. Modernism, in her account, changed the short story's conditions of possibility: it now 'may be said to stand at the edge of prose', not only because 'poetic tautness and clarity are so essential to it' but also because 'it is nearer drama than the novel' and nearer still to cinema, whose medium is 'itself busy with a technique'. Being 'of the same generation', both film and short stories 'have been accelerating together', such that for Bowen they continue to hold certain 'affinities' which are critically instructive: 'neither is sponsored by a tradition; both are, accordingly, free; both, still, are self-conscious, show a self-imposed discipline and regard for form'.",
