  "abstract": "Testicular heat stress is known to cause testicular degeneration in bulls, as it causes alterations in the spermatogenesis and sperm maturation process, characterized by a decrease in seminal quality.However, the chronology of these impairments, from the appearance of the first alterations until the recovery of spermatogenesis, is still not fully understood, and it is fundamental to provide information to intervene adequately in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this alteration.In this sense, to studies were performed; the study 1 aimed to evaluated and define the chronology of the effects of testcicular heat stress on the quality of different structural and functional characteristics of bovine sperm, specifically, during the first 28 days after the insult to give an aerly diagnosis of the testicular degeneration.Twenty Nellore bulls were distributed in the control and testicular heat stress groups (scrotal bags/96 hours) and submitted to weekly blood and semen collections, starting 14 days before the placement of the bags and remaining up to 28 days after.All semen samples were evaluated for sperm motility, morphology, plasma and acrosomal membrane integrity and mitochondrial membrane function, lipid peroxidation, and DNA fragmentation.Semen and blood plasma were also evaluated for lipid peroxidation.In the second study, the objective was to evaluate chronologically the impairments of the testicular heat stress on the quality of the same structural and functional sperm charactersitics and blood mentioned and evaluated in the previous study, as well as to evaluate the predominance of maior and minor defects, and the susceptibility from semen to lipid peroxidation at each specific stage of spermatogenesis, sperm maturation and recovery of the seminiferous epithelium.For this, it was proposed to divide the findings into 5 periods: 1 (7 and 14 days before the insult), 2 (day of removal of the insult / D0, up to 7 days before the insult), 3 (14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 days before the insult), 4 (49, 56, 63 days before the insult) and 5 (considered as the recovery period / 70 and 77 days before the insult).Ten Nellore bulls were distributed in the control and testicular heat stress groups (scrotal bags/96 hours) and submitted to weekly blood and semen collections, starting 14 days before the placement of the bags and remaining up to 77 days after.Regarding the results, in the first study it was possible to observe specially, the increase of morphological defects 7 days after the heat stress, and DNA fragmentation 28 days later.In the second study, during period 1 it was noticed that the groups of bulls were homogeneous before the insult.Period 2 showed effects of testicular heat stress on sperm maturation in the epididymis, evidenced by the increase in spermatic defects and decrease of membrane integrity.In period 3 there was an increase in sperm lipid peroxidation and a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, sperm motility, plasma membrane and DNA integrity.During period 4, the defects continued to increase and the mitochondrial potential decreased.In period 5, there was recovery of all evaluated sperm characteristics.Thus, the chronology of the effects of testicular heat stress begins with the increase of sperm defects and lipid peroxidation, suggesting oxidative stress of the semen and altering in the first place the function of the mitochondria, reflecting on the sperm motility, membranes integrity and, later, on DNA integrity.Therefore, these findings allowed us to affirm that, although sperm lipid peroxidation increases for 14 to 21 days after heat stress, sperm motility, morphology and membranes integrity remain decreased up to 63 days after stress.In this sense, the knowledge of chronology of the testicular heat stress affections during each phase of spermatogenesis and sperm maturation, bringing valuable information of the status of spermatogenesis and will aid in the achievement of accurate diagnoses, better prognosis and therapeutic interventions.",
