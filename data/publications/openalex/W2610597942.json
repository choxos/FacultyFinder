  "title": "What Aspects of Principal Leadership Are Most Highly Correlated With School Outcomes in China?",
  "abstract": "Purpose: The purpose of this study is to build a broader framework for Chinese principal leadership and to determine what aspects of principal leadership correlate most highly with school outcomes from the perspectives of both principals and teachers. Method: The data come from a 2013 national student achievement assessment in China comprising 37,749 students in Grade 8 and 9,165 teachers in 613 secondary schools. Adopting Grissom and Loeb’s measurement framework, we use both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to examine the structure of principal leadership. Then, a hierarchical linear model is employed to analyze the relationship between principal leadership and five school outcomes, controlling for basic student and teacher demographics and certain school context variables. Findings: We identify many differences and some similarities between China and the United States. We obtain five leadership factors from the principals’ self-rating data (Visibility and Direct Participation, Instruction Organization, Internal Environment Organization, Planning and Personnel, and External Relations) and three leadership factors from the teachers’ rating data (Organization and Management, Instruction and Curriculum, and Visibility and Direct Participation). Regarding student reading achievement and learning efficacy, from both the principals’ and teachers’ perspectives, the most highly correlated aspect is Instruction Organization. For teachers’ occupational stress, job burnout, and teaching efficacy, teachers’ ratings of principal leadership exhibit more significant relationships than does principals’ self-rated leadership. Implications: We explore a broader framework of principal leadership in China. We identify the benefits and analyze alternative views of the indirect effects of principal leadership on students.",
