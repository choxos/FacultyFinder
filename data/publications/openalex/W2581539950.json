  "title": "Prevalence and comorbidity of asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema among school children in Republic of Srpska: A cross-sectional study",
  "abstract": "Introduction/Objective. The incidence of comorbidity of asthma and allergic rhinitis was one of the reasons for changing guidelines for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The World Health Organization and Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma group proposed the new diagnostic and therapeutic concept ??one airway, one disease.? Further, the presence of allergic rhinitis in children with asthma contributes significantly to low control of asthma; also, the treatment of allergic rhinitis in children with asthma has positive effects in terms of reducing the severity of asthma symptoms. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of allergic diseases among children in the Republic of Srpska, as well as to determine whether allergic rhinitis and eczema are more common in children with asthma. Methods. Our study was conducted as a cross-sectional study and included 3,000 children aged six to 15 years from 13 primary schools in the Republic of Srpska. The final data processing included 1,975 correctly completed questionnaires. Results. The prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months was 7.9%, of allergic rhinitis 12.7%, and of eczema 5%. Asthma was diagnosed by a doctor in 3.5% of the children, allergic rhinitis in 19.2%, and eczema was diagnosed in 14.5% of the children. Conclusion. Children with asthma had statistically significant higher prevalence of other alergic diseases compared to general population. Also, children with mild asthma had statistically significant risk to be undiagnosed. Undiagnosed asthma in comorbidity with other allergic diseases leads to poor asthma control in children.",
