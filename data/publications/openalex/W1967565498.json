While teaching laparoscopic surgery, attending must direct the novice to certain points in the surgical field. Without standardized frames of reference (FOR) the directions can become confusing and frustrating. We designed a novel FOR overlay and standardized verbal commands to facilitate intraoperative teaching and directing. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of the FOR overlay used with a standardized language on the performance of laparoscopic tasks. METHODS Forty-two medical students were randomized to two groups: group 1 (control) performed tasks with with no overlay, the commands were limited to simple directions such as left, right, up and down; group 2 performed tasks on a overlay with commands based on a clock and x:y triangulation (fig 1). All subjects performed three different trials, each consisting of 6 bean transfers, while instructed with one of the two methods. Time to task completion and “error score” defined as the number of times the bean is moved to a wrong circle were recorded and analyzed using non-parameteric statistics. RESULTS Group 2 was faster than the control for all three trials (63,67,51 vs 87,80,71s respectively)(p<0.05). The error scores were lower for group 2 compared to the control, approaching significance in trial 1 (1.33 vs 1.67, p=0.07) and significant in trial 3 (1.26 vs 1.74, p=0.012). No significant differences were seen in trial 2 (1.4 vs 1.6, p=0.32). CONCLUSIONS Using a FOR overlay and standardized communication for directing in laparoscopy improves performance and error. This proof of concept will be used to develop a video inlay FOR for endoscopy monitors. The development and validation of standardized communication and FOR will improve teaching and patient safety during laparoscopy. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 185Issue 4SApril 2011Page: e598-e599 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Bechir Hage Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Rami Elias Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author David Williams Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Forough Farrokhyar Hamilton, Canada More articles by this author Edward D.
