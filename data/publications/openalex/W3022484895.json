Low-dose low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) and direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) may be reasonable alternatives for post-operative thromboprophylaxis in urology. We therefore performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs of these agents. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, and Central Cochrane library up to August 2018 to identify RCTs evaluating LMWH or DOAC, in head-to-head comparisons or compared with placebo or no treatment in adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. Primary outcome: symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE). Secondary outcomes: symptomatic VTE, symptomatic proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and major bleeding. Two authors independently identified studies from the search results and performed data extraction. We performed data synthesis by pairwise and network meta-analysis. We assessed the quality of studies using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool, and the quality of evidence with the GRADE approach for NMA. (PROSPERO CRD42018106181). RESULTS: We included 72 RCTs (62,792 patients) of which 56 involved orthopedic; 9 general, 4 thoracic, 2 gynecologic, and 1 urologic surgery. The majority of trials were of low risk of bias. Symptomatic PE was rare 0.24% whereas symptomatic VTE 0.66% and bleeding 0.86% were more common. Compared to low dose LMWH, DOACs may reduce symptomatic VTE (OR 0.49, 0.30- 0.80), without increase in major bleeding (OR 1.13, 0.81-1.57). Both DOACs and LMWH increased major bleeding relative to placebo. See Table 1 for meta-analysis of primary and secondary outcomes and GRADE assessment of quality. CONCLUSIONS: Efficacy of LMWH or DOAC in reducing symptomatic PE could not be demonstrated. DOACs may be more effective than low-dose LMWH at reducing symptomatic VTE and proximal DVT. Limitations include low incidence of events and low number of non-orthopedic studies. This emphasizes the need of a RCT to provide efficacy data for symptomatic events in the urological setting. Source of Funding: This study was built upon the work done in the context of the collaborative project between the American Society of Hematology (ASH) and the MacGRADE Centre of the Department of Health Research Methods, Evidence, and Impact at McMaster University, which had the objective developing original guidelines on 10 VTE related topics (http://www.hematology.org/Newsroom/Press-Releases/2015/4715.aspx). However, no specific funding was devoted to this study. © 2020 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 203Issue Supplement 4April 2020Page: e175-e175 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2020 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Maura Marcucci More articles by this author Itziar Etxeandia More articles by this author Arnav Agarwal More articles by this author Shyla Gupta More articles by this author Federico Germini More articles by this author Stephen Yang More articles by this author Matthew Ventresca More articles by this author Shaowen Tang More articles by this author Kari Tikkinen More articles by this author Gordon Guyatt More articles by this author Philippe Violette* More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
