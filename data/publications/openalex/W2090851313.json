  "title": "“I Don't Want Him Hitting On Me”: The Role of Masculinities in Creating a Chilly High School Climate",
  "abstract": "Abstract This study reports on a qualitative analysis of data from interviews with 15 heterosexual males ages 16–18 in Canadian high schools. Findings indicate that gay male youth often occupy lower status positions in the school's social hierarchy. Heterosexual males did not typically want to associate with gay male peers for fear of being perceived as gay and being “hit on.” Verbal harassment against lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth was common and reportedly not dealt with by teachers. The phrase “that's so gay” was synonymous with the terms “stupid” or “lame.” Dissenting views on homosexuality and popularity are also presented. Findings are discussed in relation to Connell's theory of masculinity.
