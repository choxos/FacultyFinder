  "title": "History and health policy in the United States: putting the past back in",
  "abstract": "This rich array of essays shows how the lens of history can clarify contemporary health-policy dilemmas and enable the reader to see ahead more clearly. --Harvey V. Fineberg, President, Institute of Medicine refreshing antidote for those finding it difficult to envision a better future for health care in America...This excellent book helps us all to better understand the subtle relationship among values, institutions, economics, and medicine that shapes our health system. --Stuart M. Butler, Vice President for Domestic Policy, The Heritage Foundation An important book for those wrestling with the appropriate role of markets in U.S. health policy. --Karen Davis, President, The Commonwealth Fund In this book, seventeen leading scholars make the case for the usefulness of history in evaluating and formulating health policy today. In looking at issues as varied as the consumer economy and the plight of the uninsured, the contributors uncover the ways we think about technology, the role of government, and contemporary medicine. They show how historical perspectives can help policy makers avoid the pitfalls of partisan, outdated, or merely fashionable approaches, as well as how knowledge of previous systems can offer alternatives when policy directions seem unclear.
