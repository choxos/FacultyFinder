  "title": "Jacques Lacan, o passador de Georges Politzer, surrealismo e psicanalise",
  "abstract": "investigate the presence of Politizer's essay, Critics of Psychology Foundations, published in 1928 and in Lacan's doctorate thesis in Psychiatry, Paranoic Psychosis and its relations to Personality, published in 1932.Such presence shines for its absence: the name of Politzer is not cited even once, in spite of that, Politzer's influence is built in the clinical case Aimée: the drama of the woman who arrived in Paris in 1929 with the intention to publish her romances.To establish the relation between Lacan and Politzer, the arguments of Michel Foucault about the function author , were used as a tool for the analysis.In his reading of Freud, Politzer created the conditions to Lacan to interpret the drama of Aimée as na element structutal of her personality.The reading that Lacan made of Politzer was decisive for his entrance in the field of the Psychoanalysis.To demonstrate the function author in the discourse installation, a specific historical scenery was delimeted: the French surrealism between the years of 1925 and 1935; thus a genealogical analysis of the historical production of the differences is carried out.The perspective of the texts selected here proves that the surrealist movement opened doors so that Freud's works could have theoretic and practical consistency in a culture which was refractory to Psychoanalysis so far.The analysis leads to the indication that Lacan was a follower of Politzer to install a clinical practice of discontinuity to the ontological conception of unconsciousness.",
