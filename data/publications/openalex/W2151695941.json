  "title": "Even Abstract Motion Influences the Understanding of Time",
  "abstract": "Abstract Many metaphor theorists argue that our mental experience of time is grounded in our understanding of space, including motion through space. Results from recent experiments – in which people think about motion, which in turn influences their thinking about time – support this position. Still, many questions remain about the nature of the metaphorical connection between time and space. Can the mere suggestion of motion influence how people reason about time, and if so, when and how? Three experiments investigated how thinking about \"abstract\" motion through sequences of numbers or letters would influence reasoning about time. Our results extend earlier psychological work on the link between time and space by showing that even motion in non-physical domains can influence temporal reasoning. The results provide further evidence that metaphorical understanding is grounded in our everyday physical and conceptual experience. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors thank Lera Boroditsky, Herbert Clark, Michael Spivey, and Rolf Zwaan for enlightening discussions related to this research, as well as Michael Leon, David Sparks, and Elsie Wang for assistance with data collection. They are also grateful to Editor Raymond Gibbs, as well as to Sarah Anderson, Caitlin Fausey, Paul Maglio, Art Markman, Bodo Winter, and others for comments on earlier drafts of this paper. This work began when the authors were conducting research at Stanford University. Notes 1Anecdotal evidence also supports this view. Researchers often use fictive motion language to describe the orientation of the mental number line (e.g., \"we represent magnitude information on a mental number line that runs from left to right for increasing magnitudes\"; CitationFischer, Dewulf, & Hill, 2005), implicitly suggesting that abstract motion is involved in numerical representation. 2These shifts in visual attention are analogous to those in the processing of fictive motion language (CitationRichardson & Matlock, 2007).",
