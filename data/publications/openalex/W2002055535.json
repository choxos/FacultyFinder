  "title": "The trend towards nephron-sparing procedures for renal masses: Surprisingly slow or reassuringly rapid?",
  "abstract": "The authors investigated trends in the proportion of nephronsparing surgeries (partial nephrectomy and ablative procedures) versus radical nephrectomy in the management of renal masses in Virginia and Kentucky by searching ICD-9 codes from 2004 to 2009.The authors used the Virginia Department of Health Patient Level Database and the Kentucky Hospital Association database to retrieve patient information.The increased popularity of research based on administrative datasets of this kind can be attributed to their availability, large size, low cost and perceived real world applicability. 2 Nevertheless, the limitations of these datasets should not be overlooked.They were not designed for clinical research and, as a result, they lack structured data collection processes and have limited links to pertinent clinical information.The validity of a database (i.e., whether the available information accurately reflects the true characteristics of a study population) is the first issue to consider when appraising studies of this kind.Uncertainty arises due to difficulty determining whether a condition is truly absent or merely unrepresented due to coding imprecision.The authors attempted to minimize inaccuracies by excluding ICD-9 codes pertaining to upper tract urothelial tumours.However, the accuracy of ICD-9 codes remains questionable and might have been clarified by cross-referencing with procedure codes or other databases.During the 6-year study period, the use of nephrectomy decreased from 74.3% to 67.3% of all surgeries performed for renal malignancies in Virginia and from 80.5% to 66% in Kentucky.The vast majority of nephron-sparing surgeries were partial nephrectomies.",
