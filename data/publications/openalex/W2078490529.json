Children included in the study had a diagnosis of dysfunctional voiding, EMG activity during voiding phase of flow curve, and lower urinary tract symptoms. METHODS Ninety seven patients were screened to enroll sixty patients which where then the distributed into two experimental groups via computer randomization: 1) the study group completed the questionnaires, history and flow rate prior to receiving biofeedback and received biofeedback the following week; 2) the control group completed the same questionnaires, history and flow rate at the initial visit and six weeks later prior to receiving biofeedback (delayed treatment group). All patients where then re-evaluated after six biofeedback sessions. Self perception domains were analyzed with the Self-Perception Profile for Children and Behavior Assessment Scale for Children questionnaires. RESULTS No significant differences where seen in baseline characteristics (age, gender, history of UTI, reflux, constipation or anti-cholinergic therapy) or questionnaire scores. Patients undergoing biofeedback (study group) had significant and clinically relevant improvement (based on previous self-perception studies) and in total dysfunctional voiding scores (P=0.001), social acceptance (P=0.012), social stress (P=0.022), and self esteem (P=0.034). CONCLUSIONS This is the first randomized controlled study to show that biofeedback significantly improves self-esteem and social acceptance, while significantly decreasing social stress in children with dysfunctional voiding. The current results suggest that continued use of biofeedback has a positive impact on urinary function, which translates into improvement in self-perception. © 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 185Issue 4SApril 2011Page: e332 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2011 by American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.MetricsAuthor Information Bryce Weber Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Joao Luiz Pippi Salle Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Angela Buffett Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Sharon Guger Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Bruno Leslie Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Luis Braga Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Darius Bagli Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Walid Farhat Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Armando Lorenzo Toronto, Canada More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
