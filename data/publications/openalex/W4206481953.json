  "abstract": "The Valentine Gold Project (VGP) is located in the west-central region of the island of Newfoundland and encompasses four significant gold deposits, which are structurally controlled and of orogenic origin.These deposits, which have proven challenging targets for geophysical exploration, occur proximal to a major thrust faulted contact between the Precambrian Valentine Lake Intrusive Complex (VLIC), which houses the majority of gold mineralization, and the Silurian Rogerson Lake Conglomerate.Hosted within the silicic quartz-eye porphyry and trondhjemite phases of the VLIC, the gold concentrations are associated with extensional and shear parallel quartz-tourmaline-pyrite (QTP) veining.The VGP has undergone multiple complex stages of deformation and contains many generations of mafic dykes.While geophysical techniques are commonly used to investigate mineral prospects, their ability to delineate the ore zone at the Valentine Gold Project has met with little success.This is primarily because the gold is scattered throughout veins within the resistive, siliceous host rocks and the relationship between the mineralization and the property's mafic dykes is unclear.Consequently, the primary methods for locating the ore have been drilling and soil sampling.This study employs the gravity method, a fresh geophysical technique that has not previously been used over the property, to investigate the VGP.Although gravity methods are often used in mineral exploration, they are not typically applied to the type of gold deposits present at the Valentine Gold Project, where the density contrast between lithologies is small, the topography is rough and the overburden is thick and irregular.A 2018 proof-of-concept survey over the gold-bearing hydrothermal alteration zone, using a Scintrex CG-5 Autograv system, revealed a small but measurable negative gravity anomaly.Encouraged by this, in August 2019, a 14.2 line-kilometre broad-scale gravity survey, comprising 159 stations, was carried out over the property in an effort to map the subsurface extent of the alteration zone and delineate areas suitable for further exploratory drilling.Additional in-fill gravity stations were acquired on bogs and along lake shorelines during the winter and summer of 2020, yielding a total of 252 gravity stations throughout the property.The resulting property-wide Bouguer gravity map indicates that there is a measurable low gravity anomaly from the alteration zone.This suggests that gravity is a suitable technique for assessing the mineral prospects at the VGP, and it may be applicable over similar deposit types, which are exhibited in belts across the island of Newfoundland.",
