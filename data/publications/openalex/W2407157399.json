This dual task paradigm was used to test the relationship between the modality of which a primary task was presented, and the modality of a subsequently presented secondary task. Earlier findings suggest that cross-modal presentations lead to higher facilitation rates for items that were previously aligned with auditory targets when compared with only unimodal (auditory or visual) presentations. The current study extends these findings to conditions where the primary task is presented visually, while testing later word recognition in either the same (visual), different (auditory), or across (audiovisual) modalities. Overall, target-aligned information was recognized at significantly higher rates than non-aligned information for all three recognition tests. Critically, when comparing the magnitude of facilitation, cross-modal presentation resulted in the highest degree of facilitation. Keywords: Attention, Dual Task Paradigms, Implicit Learning, Inattentional Blindness Introduction The degree to which task-irrelevant and unattended stimuli are processed has been investigated using paradigms commonly employed in the exploration of visual perceptual learning and inattentional blindness (Dewald & Sinnett, 2011a, 2011b; Dewald, Sinnett, & Doumas, 2011, 2013; Rees, Russell, Firth, & Driver, 1999; Seitz & Watanabe, 2003, 2005; Sinnett, Costa, & Soto-Faraco, 2006; Tsushima, Sasaki, & Watanabe, 2006; Tsushima, Seitz, & Watanabe, 2008; Watanabe, Nanez & Sasaki, 2001). This body of work has demonstrated that unattended, task-irrelevant stimuli may be processed if presented at the same time as a task- relevant target in an attention-demanding task. Interestingly though, these studies yield seemingly contradictory results, indicating that later recognition of the unattended stimuli will either be facilitated (Dewald & Sinnett, 2011b; Dewald et al., 2013; Seitz & Watanabe, 2003; Watanabe et al., 2001) or inhibited (Dewald & Sinnett 2011a; Dewald et al., 2011; Tsushima et al., 2006; Tsushima et al., 2008) depending on various factors such as the frequency of exposure and whether the stimuli was presented above or below the threshold for explicit awareness. Regardless of this documented dichotomy of a facilitatory or inhibitory relationship, the various paradigms employed are fundamentally the same in that participants are required to pay attention to specific stimuli while simultaneously ignoring irrelevant information. Later recognition of the irrelevant items is then assessed via some variation of a surprise recognition task. Crucially, the irrelevant items in the recognition task could have originally appeared at the same time (target-aligned), or not (non-aligned), as a task- relevant target presented amongst the attended stimuli in the primary task. Initial research suggested that facilitation or inhibition was dependent on whether the irrelevant target item was presented either below or above (respectively) the threshold for explicit awareness. For instance, the seminal finding by Watanabe et al. (2001) used a presentation of dynamic random dot (DRD) displays (the irrelevant stimuli) in which a small subset (5%) of the otherwise randomly moving dots (subthreshold to explicit awareness) moved coherently in the same direction. While exposed to this display, participants also engaged in an attention demanding target identification task (i.e., letter identification) presented in a rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP). Subsequently, a motion identification task was presented that required participants to determine the direction of moving dots in a similar DRD display. Ultimately, the findings demonstrated that identification for dots that moved in the same direction as subthreshold motions, temporally aligned (target- aligned) with the presence of the task-relevant target in the letter identification task, was significantly better than for motions not paired with task-relevant targets (see also, Seitz & Watanabe, 2003). These results were taken as evidence that frequent exposure to task-irrelevant stimuli that are",
