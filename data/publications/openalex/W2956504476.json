  "title": "PROTOCOL: The effect of interventions for women's empowerment on children's health and education: A systematic review of evidence from low‐ and middle‐income countries",
  "abstract": "While numerous facts and figures point towards the increasing opportunities for women and their growing participation in economic, political and public decision-making processes, women remain in disadvantaged positions compared to men in many places of the world (World Economic Forum, 2015). Gender bias is deeply embedded in cultures, economies, and political and social institutions around the world, denying women an equal part in society and decision-making. Gender based discrimination in access to economic opportunities, lack of representation and participation in economic and social spheres, and limited opportunities to accumulate resources could perpetuate vulnerability to poverty among women, limit human capital accumulation and restrict economic growth. Women's economic involvement, their political participation, and their empowerment in the two crucial domains of education and health, are often seen as the four fundamental factors to create just and equitable societies where both women and men have control over their lives and exert similar, if not equal, influence in society. The Global gender gap report of 2015 uses the aforementioned four domains as the supporting pillars of their gender gap index, which they established as a tool to proxy for the status of women's empowerment since 2006. This index utilizes the information on the opportunities to equal economic and political participation, as well as access to health and education facilities and resources, to determine the gap between males and females in each country, within six different geographical regions. They find that in all aspects, school enrolment and attendance rates, political participation and earnings and labour force participation women are lower than men (World Economic Forum, 2015). Although there has been a large improvement in the overall gender gap, regional trends vary vastly. Where most countries have improved, some have stagnated and a few have even deteriorated. On average, North America seems to have performed the best at reducing the gender gap as shown in the gender gap index, followed by Europe and Central Asia, while the Middle East and North Africa region seems to be the worst performing. Although this overall ranking also seems to persist in economic participation and opportunities gap, but in terms of political empowerment, the Asia and pacific region performs much better than Europe and central Asia. Disparities in health and survival have been reduced massively or eliminated entirely in all regions, besides those in the Asia and pacific region where nonetheless more than 90 per cent of the gap has been closed. Sub Saharan Africa performs the worst in terms of educational attainment, far behind any of the other regions. There appear to be different forces that drive these gaps and their persistence within each region, and these are not limited to low and middle income countries. For example, compared to the gender gap index of 2006, even within the Nordic countries, which have the smallest gender gaps, Iceland has overtaken Sweden by reducing the gap at the rate of 10 per cent, while Sweden has been moving at a glacial pace of around one per cent. On the other hand, in Asia, Nepal and in Latin America, Nicaragua and Brazil are all low income countries that have reduced these gender gaps at outstanding rates, comparable to those of Iceland. Simultaneously though, this swift decline in the gap is not observed across all low and middle income countries. Sri Lanka, Jordan, Mali, Croatia and Slovak Republic are all countries that have widened their gender gaps over time, while Iran has not moved from its 58 per cent gender gap since 2006. When examining each of the four components of the gender gap, there appear variations between the components that have made most progress in terms of reducing this gap. Gender gaps in economic participation and opportunity are the widest, indicating the wide gap in wages and unequal professional, skilled and technical participation between men and women. Despite the improvements in higher education, where female participation is higher than males in 97 of the 109 countries, it is men who make up the majority in skilled workers in over 60 per cent of the countries. Even if women's political participation has been rising the sharpest since 2006, their economic participation has arrested since 2009/10, where women in 2015 finally achieved the same level of earnings as men did nearly in 2005, 10 years ago. The Global gender gap report is a clear indication of the intention of all international and national entities towards the measurement of gender equal goals and overall women's empowerment. Another convincing indication of its gaining prominence is visible in Goal 5 of the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This Goal sets out to “achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls” (United Nations, 2015). As a result, there have been many measures that researchers and politicians are following, and critically evaluating, to determine the gaps between females and males. These may be the aforementioned gender gap index, the Gender Development Index (GDI), the Gender Empowerment Measure (GEM), the Gender Inequality Index (GII) (UNDP, 1995, 1996) or the Social Institutions and Gender Index (SIGI) (Branisa, Klasen, & Ziegler, 2009). While the former rely on the gender inequalities within the four (or fewer) domains that comprise the gender gap index (apart from the standard of living component within the GDI and GEM), the SIGI differentiates itself by incorporating the legal and societal norms and practices that are the underlying cause of the self-same inequalities. Therefore, via widespread literature and research on the same, the concept of women's empowerment is not only gaining prominence and relevance in academic articles and growth related debates, but also in the overall international development and policy agenda. As Malhotra et al. (2002) point out, women's empowerment has certain unique characteristics that distinguish it from the disempowerment of other disadvantaged or socially excluded group. One of these elements is that women are not just any other socially disadvantaged or excluded group among society, but rather a category of individuals that have a large overlap with each of these other disempowered and disadvantaged groups. Secondly, it is often household and interfamilial relations that are what disempower women in the first place and form the crux of the discrimination towards them. Therefore, familial relations are generally one that accentuate the problem, and this domestic disparity is another key point that differentiates this group from the others. Lastly, while most discriminations are borne of particular institutions prevalent in society, this discrimination is fundamentally driven by those supporting patriarchal structures. This inherently means that any move towards female empowerment would not only require an overhaul of the official institutions, as is important for empowerment of any marginalized group, but particularly those that foster patriarchal structures. These three crucial differences emphasize the nature and magnitude of the problem and the formidable measures that are required for any positive change. While gender equality is an end in itself, there is also the expectation that empowerment of women in all sectors of life will build stronger economies and propel growth, improve quality of life and help to achieve equality of rights and actions for half of the world's population. One potential channel through which women's empowerment might affect growth, which is a key determinant of economic growth in itself, is child development, particularly child health and education. While both of these are important channels in and as of themselves, to contribute towards a rising growth trajectory, within this review, we intend to link the two. The importance of child development outcomes for economic growth itself has been discussed in several strands of literature, thereby stressing its role in promoting growth. David Barker posited the foetal origins hypothesis in epidemiological studies, which connects chronic, degenerative conditions of adult health, including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, with health circumstances decades earlier, especially in utero nutrition. Economists have expanded on this hypothesis and investigated a broader range of shocks in early life that impact later-life outcomes, including test scores, education attainment, income and health (Almond & Currie, 2011). James Heckman, Paul Gertler and others also published several studies investigating the impact of early learning and development programmes for disadvantaged children. Results suggest a significant impact on skill levels, health outcomes, overall workforce strength and economic growth over a longer time period (Campbell et al., 2014; Conti, Heckman, & Pinto, 2015; Cunha & Heckman, 2009; Doyle, Harmon, Heckman, Logue, & Moon, 2013; Doyle, Harmon, Heckman, & Tremblay, 2009; Gertler et al., 2013). The goal of this review is to systematically assess the evidence that investigates the effect of interventions that empower women on child development outcomes. Therefore, given the prerequisite of women's empowerment, we will assess exactly how child development outcomes are thus affected. For the purpose of this review, the definition of empowerment is one that we adopt from Kabeer (1999). It states empowerment as “the expansion in people's ability to make strategic life choices in a context where this ability was previously denied to them; a process that entails thinking outside the system and challenging the status quo, where people can make choices from the vantage point of real alternatives without punishingly high costs.” This inherently includes several measures, such as women's improved access to health and education, their financial, political and economic empowerment and overall legal and institutional amendments. Programs that address women's economic empowerment are very diverse both in terms of intervention and in terms of the institutional framework in which they are implemented (Buvinic, Furst-Nichols, & Pryor, 2013). For instance, interventions have focused on promoting women's ability to secure decent jobs, improved access to education, provision of health care, support of women as entrepreneurs (i.e. financial assistance, training), promotion of women to participate in the labour market, changing laws that give women access to land, inheritance and property rights and those give women political decision power. Those interventions that empower women and that directly or indirectly have a second-generation impact are those that we are interested in. The latter might be represented by an intervention that increases women's exposure and access to part time work, job sharing and consequently access to childcare options. This intervention would directly affect women but also indirectly have an impact on the next generation. There are several long-term and short-term interventions possible to arrive at better child development outcomes. Increases in economic and livelihood options for women can be a consequence of improvements in labour rights and laws, leading to improvements in women's household income, increased food intake and schooling consumption for children. Access to microcredit or conditional cash transfers and other such governmental subsidies could lead to increasing access to resources and credit, both of which are forms of intervention which have been shown to lead to a higher allocation of resources onto children's health and education (Blumberg, 1988; Duflo, 2003; Haddad & Hoddinott, 1994; Hoddinott & Haddad, 1995; Lundberg, Pollak, & Wales, 1997; Pitt, Khandker, Chowdhury, & Millimet, 2003; Qian, 2008; Quisumbing & Maluccio, 2003; Rangel, 2006). This increased access might also affect women's agency itself, implying increased autonomy, and self-sufficiency, translating the same values onto the girl child, and affecting child development outcomes (Ghuman, 2003; Kabeer, 1999; Shroff, Griffiths, Adair, Suchindran, & Bentley, 2009; Smith, Ramakrishnan, Ndiaye, Haddad, & Martotell, 2003; World Bank, 2014). These, however, are more long terms consequences of an improved political, ideological and economic environment for a girl child to grow in. Increased political opportunities for women could also lead to improvements in infrastructure and capacities related to children, such as more schools, better roads, closer access to water and increased supply of electricity and other such infrastructure and facilities (Chattopadhyay & Duflo, 2004; Duflo, 2005). A lot of these facilities might not only affect women's role and aspirations in rural villages and households, but also young girls, leading to an overhaul in the institutional structure and hierarchies existent within the society (Beaman, Chattopadhyay, Duflo, Pande, & Topalova, 2009; Beaman, Duflo, Pande, & Topalova, 2012). Better health for the mother may swiftly improve child health outcomes already from in utero stages (Almond & Currie, 2011; Osmani & Sen, 2003). Although these interventions might be implement over a short or medium term time frame, their impact can even expand over longer time frames by creating an enabling environment on account of sustained improvements in schooling, health and sanitation facilities, improved access to resources and relevant technology and a dissolution of the patriarchal mesh of society. On the other hand, these improvements in social, economic and political opportunities could result in increased tensions within the households leading to a larger incidence of domestic violence (Eswaran & Malhotra, 2011; Heath, 2014; Macmillan & Gartner, 1999). A number of studies (also meta-analysis) have already examined the impact of child exposure to domestic violence, and its harmful psychological and cognitive effects (Fantuzzo & Mohr, 1999; Kitzmann, Gaylord, Holt, & Kenny, 2003; Osofsky, 2003). Moreover, with more economic or political participation, there might be lesser time allocated towards child rearing and caring activities, which has been shown to affect cognitive abilities of children and child development in the early years after birth (although these are generally studies in high income country context) (Baum II, 2003; Baydar & Brooks-Gunn, 1991; Brooks-Gunn & Duncan, 1997; Desai, Chase-Lansdale, & Michael, 1989; James-Burdumy, 2005; Ruhm, 2004, 2008; Waldfogel, Han, & Brooks-Gunn, 2002). It might also cause changes in the household and community structures, perhaps regressively (Luke & Munshi, 2011). Moreover, taking up work may expose the mother to health hazards (occupational injuries and diseases), which could in turn affect the child adversely, given that women's health is often synonymous with maternal health (Paul-Majumder, 1996; Pick, Ross, & Dada, 2002). Other channels could be via access to credit and financial services, which could result in increased indebtedness of the household, harmfully affecting child development (Mader, 2013; Schicks, 2014; Taylor, 2011). Education and health spending on children might be spread disproportionately, for e.g. female child could receive a smaller share of the investment than a male child. Furthermore, social norms regarding adequate gender roles, as well as the policy and resource environment, might in general limit the impact of the programs. The theory of change that guides our analysis has been attached within the Appendix. It is based, to some extent, on the UNICEF framework that has been adopted by Ruel (2008), although some modifications have been made to include the education outcomes that are also of interest to us, besides the child health outcomes. Despite the large attention that women's economic empowerment has as a policy objective, to date, this research appears largely scattered and the few existing literature reviews have focused on limited number of articles, a limited time span, or a non-systematic assessment of available published and unpublished studies (Bandiera & Natraj, 2013; Burger, 2010; Buvinic & Furst-Nichols, 2014; Duflo, 2012; Yoong, Rabinovich, & Diepeveen, 2012). We intend to cover the gaps in these studies in three key ways: To our knowledge, there is very little evidence cataloguing the link between women's empowerment and child development outcomes. So far, the literature examines the deficits that are present within adults, given the differential circumstances during their birth as well as growth period. These studies have also addressed various channels and potential mechanisms where female empowerment would affect child development outcomes. Reviews so far have focussed on maternal and child nutrition and the relation or co-incidence between the two (Bhutta et al., 2013; Bold, Mara, Quisumbing, & Gillespie, 2013; Cunningham, Ruel, Ferguson, & Uauy, 2015), and we intend to extend this by including other health as well as education related outcomes for children. Some reviews have added onto the literature via a particular intervention and its impact on child health: participatory learning activities, for instance (Prost et al., 2013). Other reviews have focussed explicitly only on the review of the literature and disregarded any meta–analysis (Laverack, 2006). This review will attempt to examine the relative importance of each channel and how effectively can policy address the issues that inhibit child development outcomes due to particular female empowerment policies. Another contribution is the methodological approach of a systematic review. This work would entail collection, appraisal and synthesizes of the evidence based on a systemised process. This implies a more rigorous screening of the evidence, more systematic and demanding in terms of the exact conditions surrounding the intervention, the outcomes, the time period and the country coverage. The Campbell Collaboration has published systematic reviews and meta-analyses of international development interventions which explicitly aim to empower women - for example microcredit (Vaessen et al., 2014) and self-help groups (Brody et al., 2015) - or those which may have consequences for women - for example, land reform (Lawry et al., 2014). However, this review is the first systematic review to examine the comparative effects of programmes aiming to empower women on outcomes for the subsequent generation. The review is being conducted alongside a review by Ibanez et al. (2017) examining the effectiveness of community-level women's empowerment interventions on household wellbeing. The third point where we intend to contribute to the literature on the particular relation between female empowerment and child development outcomes is that this study will conduct a meta-analysis with the data extracted from the selected quantitative studies. The meta-analysis will comprise a risk of bias assessment and synthesis of the effect sizes to provide a quantitative estimation of the effect. In this section we list the study design inclusion criteria, the search methods and the approach to data collection, critical appraisal and synthesis. Based on the research design, we categorize the studies into two major groups: a. Controlled experimental designs and natural experiments These type of studies specifically use a random assignment of the intervention to the treatment group, and evaluate the effect by comparing the outcome with the control group and by using an appropriate methodology. b. Quasi-experimental designs In cases whether the assignment of the treatment is not random, various quasi-experimental designs are used to evaluate the treatment effects. These methods include regression discontinuity design (RDD), instrumental variable (IV), difference-in-differences (DID), fixed effects analysis, propensity score matching, and interrupted time series (single country) designs. In the absence of randomization, the main challenge is that the treatment can be endogenous, i.e. it can be confounded with unobservable factors correlated with both the treatment and the outcome. We include studies that address this potential endogeneity issue through any of the aforementioned methods. We include natural experiments and quasi-experimental designs to account for instances where it is impossible to randomize (e.g. a country-wide policy change) or unethical (e.g. certain types of outcomes like child mortality), and due to the inclusion of both intended and unintended (including adverse) outcomes. The includable non-randomized studies will use credible methods that take into account confounding. We exclude studies that do not attempt to evaluate a causal effect of the intervention on the outcome using these study design. Thus, we exclude any qualitative study or any report that has purely descriptive analysis. We also exclude studies that use data on multiple countries for cross-country time series or panel analysis. We include interventions where the participants are women and girls (irrespective of age) from low- and middle-income countries as defined by the World Bank categorization at the time the data were collected. Thus, we exclude studies of interventions in high-income countries. Programs where men also participated, but the intervention was aimed at promoting women's economic empowerment, are also included. We will not consider studies that might improve children's health or education outcomes but do so through a channel other than women's empowerment. Therefore, we exclude interventions targeted directly on children's education or health outcomes, unless they have an effect on the second generation through the channel of women's empowerment (girls in this case). Thus, interventions such as cash transfers conditional on school enrolment/attendance, school level interventions towards raising effectiveness of teaching or teacher attendance etc. will not be included. Similar restrictions apply for interventions targeting children's health, such as deworming programs, provision of supplementary nutrition etc. Note that some of these programs may indeed have a gender component; for instance, interventions that target girls’ education (e.g. provision of bicycles to girls in secondary schools) may indeed lead to some form of female empowerment. However, unless a study reports the effect of such program on the second generation, it will not be considered for our systematic review. Some interventions may have unintended effects on women's empowerment even though the design of the program has neither any objective for women's empowerment nor any gender based component. We will exclude such programs, unless the intervention specifies any component which differentially targets men and women beneficiaries, the female empowerment effect will be considered as unintended consequence of the intervention. Hence such intervention will not be eligible for inclusion in our study. We include studies that have a clearly defined comparison group for evaluation of the treatment effect. When the intervention aimed at female empowerment is targeted towards a set of households, then the comparison group would consist of households which are not exposed to this treatment. Since the intervention can also be at various other levels, such as individuals, communities, or regions, therefore the comparison will be made with the corresponding group that has not been affected by this specific intervention. The comparison group is considered to be not affected by the intervention, either when there is no intervention, or when they are still in pipeline while the study was conducted, or they are in a business as usual situation. The idea of comparison group is to capture the counterfactual scenario, therefore the comparison group has to be sufficiently similar with the treatment group. This will be reflected through baseline comparison (pre-test differences) of observable characteristics (including the outcome variable) between the treatment and the comparison groups. We shall also include direct comparison of different interventions (active controls), as it constitutes an important part of the comparative systematic review. Where a study includes more than two intervention arms, we will include in the review only the intervention and control/comparison arms that meet the eligibility criteria. a. Primary outcomes: We focus on the effect of these interventions on child development, particularly on children's health and education. Health: The outcomes are some indicator of child health, e.g. mortality, morbidity, stunting, underweight, wasting, immunization, etc. More specifically, we shall consider child level measures such as height-for-age z-score (stunting), weight-for-height z-score (wasting), weight-for-age z-score (underweight/overweight), body mass index, etc. In some cases the child level observations can be aggregated at the household level and the reported measure can reflect the percentage of children who are stunted/wasted/underweight/immunized. We shall also include them as outcome variables. The investment in children's health and education, both in terms of material resources and time, is also considered a primary outcome for the purpose of this review. It should be noted that the effect of intervention can have both intended (positive) and unintended (negative) effects on the outcomes stated above. For example, an intervention that raises the mother's income can lead to better education and health of children due to greater investment on children. However, in absence of childcare facilities, an intervention that provides labour market opportunity to mothers can actually lead to worse education or health outcomes of children because the mother may not be able to devote enough time for child rearing activities. Studies that capture unintended consequences reflected through the outcomes described above are also included. b. Secondary outcomes: Moreover, it is important to mention that the channels through which the interventions specified above may have an effect on children's human capital comprise of another set of intermediate outcomes (mediators) such as women's intra-household bargaining power and time use. In the context of adverse outcomes, it is especially relevant to consider the change in mother's time use pattern due to her improved economic participation. If the mother is unable to spend time in child rearing, then it can have a negative effect on younger children's health and cognitive development, and older children may have to substitute for mother's time. Such mediator outcomes may include various indicators of women's empowerment, such as decision making within household, labour force participation, income, or education level. While these intermediate outcomes are important, the objective of this study is to focus on the final outcome variables that reflect child's human capital formation, therefore we will include studies irrespective of whether they report intermediate outcomes. However, we shall also collect these intermediate outcomes from those studies that do report them, and include them in the review. We will include studies of any follow-up duration. We shall include studies that are conducted within the time span of 1990–2016. The main reason for this selection is that the study designs that we considered started to be produced/appearing in this field mostly after 1990. As Cameron et al. (2016) points out, beginning mid-1990s, impact evaluation evidence was being published at a steady rate. They find that after the year 2000, experimental and quasi-experimental studies became even more popular and were frequently published in social science journals, and outlets of international agencies, governments, universities, and other institutions. Therefore, given our objective of focusing on experimental and quasi-experimental evidence, it is plausible to restrict inclusion to studies conducted during 1990–2016. We will include studies irrespective of whether they are published in journals/books, or available as working papers, reports or other. The search strategy used here is adopted from Hammerstrøm, Wade, & Jørgensen, 2010 and it aims to find both journal publications as well as other publications including working papers. A three-step search strategy will be utilized in this review. The second stage will consist of searching backward and forward citations, where reference lists of included studies will be searched and reviewed for additional studies. The reference lists of relevant systematic reviews will also be searched, along with important non-systematic literature reviews such as in Handbook of Development Economics. A record will be maintained, describing the databases searched, the keywords used, and search results from each search engine. The search results will be presented using the standard PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Standard for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) flow diagram, including the reasons for exclusion at full-text stage. For searching the above databases, our team will use search terms based on inclusion criteria, developed through test-searches. The search terms used to search the selected databases are presented in the appendix. These will be modified to fit the search format for each database. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed by a team member using the specific inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine whether the study should be included in the analysis. The selection will be done independently by one team member. An assessment of a random sample of studies by each assessor will be carried out as quality assurance. The selection of studies will be done in accordance with the types of interventions and outcomes discussed in the objectives section. For instance, we will include the following studies: “Old-age pension and",
