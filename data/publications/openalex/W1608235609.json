  "title": "In defence of Arnhem Land rock art research",
  "abstract": "In 1992 two papers dealing with Arnhem Land rock art were published by Ivan Haskovec. Both contain previously unpublished illustrations of rock paintings and increase the range of published material available for scholarly analysis. One paper examines a particular style of human figure found between Oenpelli and Magela Creek, which Haskovec has labelled 'Northern Running Figures' or 'NW' (Haskovec l992a). He begins his examination with an assessment of the existing Arnhem Land rock art sequences. Then he moves on to discuss the spatial and temporal distribution of the figures, and to describe the style and its content. Finally, he suggests absolute dates for the period during which the figures were produced. His other paper examines the claim made by Chaloupka (1977, 1979, 1983, 1984, 1985) that large paintings of animals and human figures in naturalistic style occur near the beginning of the Arnhem Land art sequence (Haskovec 1992b). This paper may be considered to have two parts. The first is primarily a reappraisal of Chaloupka's written and illustrative evidence, and an in-the-field reappraisal of the overlay sequences at two 'key' sites at Mount Gilruth - the sites upon which Chaloupka based his original claim. Haskovec concludes that evidence for the chronological position claimed by Chaloupka does not exist. In the second part Haskovec reinterprets Chaloupka's evidence and claims the discovery of new overlay sequences which necessitate a rearranging of the sequence of art styles. He then goes on to suggest absolute dates for this new sequence and to offer hypotheses to account for some of the changes in the art. At face value each of these papers appears to be a substantial contribution to the discipline. In fact, both are so burdened with serious problems - inaccuracies, misrepresentations, wrong claims and a recurrent failure to situate the discussion in existing scholarly discourse - that unanswered they do serious damage to the discipline. This article seeks to address some of these problems. Space precludes a comprehensive listing and reader tolerance must also be considered. I will therefore limit myself to the most serious issues.",
