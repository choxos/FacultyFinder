  "title": "A “Deliberative Turn” in German Nuclear Waste Governance?",
  "abstract": "In an effort to overcome the stalemate in nuclear waste governance (NWG) in Germany, a \"Commission on the Storage of High-Level Radioactive Waste\" was established in 2014 and tasked with providing detailed, in-depth recommendations on the selection process. The Commission aimed to open up the debate on NWG to actors that had previously been excluded from the process and tried to initiate a \"deliberative turn\" by orienting its work to the ideal of deliberative democracy. This paper investigates whether the participation process conducted by the Commission really captured deliberative democratic ideals. To this end, the deliberative model of democracy is operationalized to make it applicable to reallife conditions. Applying the criteria distilled from the theory to the Commission's participation formats, I identify a deliberative deficit regarding the inclusiveness, fairness, and transparency of the Commission's procedure as well as concerning the feedback-mechanisms for how the results of deliberation have been integrated into policy making. Even though this paper focuses primarily on a single case (i.e. the public participation process conducted by the Commission), I conclude with a discussion on whether the results can be transferred to deliberative events in other fields of politics.",
