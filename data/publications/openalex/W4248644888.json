  "abstract": "Guillaume Dupuytren (1777–1835)1,2 was the greatest French surgeon since Pare. As the chief surgeon of l'Hôtel Dieu, he reigned as an absolute monarch for 20 years spending his prodigious energy in the care and study of his patients. His contributions to our knowledge of surgical pathology were substantial. One of the areas upon which he shed light was the treatment of fractures. In addition to the material published here and his work on ankle fractures, Dupuytren studied the healing of fractures. He was the first to use the terms provisional and permanent callus. He described the process of fracture healing as it proceeded through five stages from injury to complete healing. The details of this work were published in his lectures3 and are available in English translation.4",
