  "abstract": "Looking Back, Moving ForwardFigureI am delighted to present the fourth issue of the ACG Case Reports Journal, which culminates our first year of publication. Over the past year, we received 470 submissions, of which 81 were selected for publication. Our success would not be possible without the efforts of the authors, reviewers, and editors, as well as ACG Publications Committee and ACG support staff, and we owe them all a great deal of gratitude. My term as the Editor-in-Chief ends with this issue, and a new editorial board will take over the ACG Case Reports Journal, led by new Editor-in-Chief Ryan Law, DO, who was integral to our first year success while serving as Associate Editor. The Journal will surely continue to grow and thrive under his leadership. Three other current Editors will also stay on board for a second term: Manish Singla, MD, as Executive Editor, Nazia Hasan, MD, MPH, as Associate Editor, and Andres Yarur, MD, as Associate Editor. Their invaluable service and continued commitment to the success of the Journal is greatly appreciated. Joining the staff for the new term are four talented new Associate Editors: Anand Kumar, MD, MPH, from the Fox Chase Cancer Center, Brent Lacey, MD, from Naval Medical Center San Diego, Richa Skukla, MD, from Baylor College of Medicine, and Ryan Ungaro, MD, from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. These editors were selected from a very competitive pool of applicants, and I look forward to seeing their contributions in the coming year. The Editorial Board continues to welcome your feedback on the Journal, and encourages all interested GI fellows to submit an interesting case report or image or to sign up as a peer reviewer. Please explore our website (acgcasereports.gi.org) for more information on how to get involved. Mohammad Yaghoobi MD, MSc, AFS ACG Case Reports Journal Editor-in-Chief",
