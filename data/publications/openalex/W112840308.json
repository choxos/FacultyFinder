If venous leakage is defined as either a failure to increase intracorporeal pressure greater than the systolic blood pressure or a rapid decrease in intracorporeal pressure after cessation of saline infusion during cavernosometry, 30 of the 44 men (68 per cent) fall into this category. If cavernosography (43 men) is used to define the presence of a venous leakage in these impotent patients 37 (86 per cent) fall into this category. These data support recent observations that there is a high incidence of venous leakage as defined by these criteria in men with organic impotence. The significance of these findings can be determined only once a similar study in age-matched potent men is performed. © 1988 by The American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc.FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byOkumu L, Braden T, Vail K, Simon L and Goyal H (2018) Low Androgen Induced Penile Maldevelopment Involves Altered Gene Expression of Biomarkers of Smooth Muscle Differentiation and a Key Enzyme Regulating Cavernous Smooth Muscle Cell ToneJournal of Urology, VOL. 192, NO. 1, (267-273), Online publication date: 1-Jul-2014.Kim E and McVary K (2018) Long-Term Results With Penile Vein Ligation for Venogenic ImpotenceJournal of Urology, VOL. 153, NO. 3, (655-658), Online publication date: 1-Mar-1995.Wespes E, Moreira de Goes P, Sattar A and Schulman C (2018) Objective Criteria in the Long-Term Evaluation of Penile Venous SurgeryJournal of Urology, VOL. 152, NO. 3, (888-890), Online publication date: 1-Sep-1994.Wespes E and Schulman C (2018) Venous Impotence: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis and TreatmentJournal of Urology, VOL. 149, NO. 5 Part 2, (1238-1245), Online publication date: 1-May-1993.Montorsi F, Guazzoni G, Bergamaschi F, Ferini-Strambi L, Barbieri L and Rigatti P (2018) Four-Drug Intracavernous Therapy for Impotence Due to Corporeal Veno-Occlusive DysfunctionJournal of Urology, VOL. 149, NO. 5 Part 2, (1291-1295), Online publication date: 1-May-1993.Freedman A, Costa Neto F, Mark Mehringer C and Rajfer J (2018) Long-Term Results of Penile Vein Ligation for Impotence from Venous LeakageJournal of Urology, VOL. 149, NO. 5 Part 2, (1301-1303), Online publication date: 1-May-1993.Cookson M, Phillips D, Huff M and Fitch W (2018) Analysis of Microsurgical Penile Revascularization Results by Etiology of ImpotenceJournal of Urology, VOL. 149, NO. 5 Part 2, (1308-1312), Online publication date: 1-May-1993.Moriel E, Mehringer C, Schwartz M and Rajfer J (2018) Pulmonary Migration of Coils Inserted for Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction Caused by Venous LeakageJournal of Urology, VOL. 149, NO. 5 Part 2, (1316-1318), Online publication date: 1-May-1993.Jarow J and Defranzo A (2018) Hypervascularity Of The Glans Penis Following Arterialization Of The Dorsal VeinJournal of Urology, VOL. 147, NO. 3 Part 1, (706-708), Online publication date: 1-Mar-1992.Montague D (2018) Editorial CommentsJournal of Urology, VOL. 147, NO. 3 Part 1, (708-708), Online publication date: 1-Mar-1992.Rajfer J (2018) Editorial CommentsJournal of Urology, VOL. 147, NO. 3 Part 1, (708-708), Online publication date: 1-Mar-1992.
