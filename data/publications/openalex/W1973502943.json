  "title": "Effect of petroleum hydrocarbons on Atlantic cod, <i>Gadus morhua</i>, following chronic exposure",
  "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to ascertain the effects of crude oils at low concentrations on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) following long-term exposure (3–21 weeks) in a flow-through seawater system. Control and oil-treated fish were fed to satiation. Effects were assessed by comparing condition factor, organ indices, and hematological values with those of corresponding control animals. No mortality occurred but food consumption was significantly reduced in oil-treated cod, especially during summer–autumn. Condition factor and somatic indices of some organs were lower in oil-treated fish. Gall bladders were enlarged in oil-treated fish. Effects of oil exposure were less pronounced during winter, as food intake in both groups of fish was reduced considerably. The rate of gametogenesis was slower in male cod exposed to oil fractions in summer–autumn whereas spermeation was delayed in fish treated in winter–spring. These studies provide evidence that feeding, growth, and reproduction in male cod are biologically important variables that are affected following chronic exposure to petroleum.",
