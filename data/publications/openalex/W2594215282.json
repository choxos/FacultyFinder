  "abstract": "CLINICAL PRACTICE INTERVIEWS HOPE -3, BP treatment, milestones in CV prevention Salim Yusuf: We tested in this trial the role of lipid lowering with a statin and blood-pressure (BP) lowering with a low -dose combination of candesartan and thiazide.The concept behind it is that the association between lipids and cardiovascular disease, or BP and cardiovascular disease, is graded with no threshold, yet most of the trials were done only in those with either high risk, high lipid levels, or high BP levels.There is a graded association between BP and lipids versus cardiovascular disease, but most of the trials were done in people with high risk, high BP, or high lipid levels.Part I: Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)-3 trial Akbar Panju: Professor Yusuf, you are a world -renowned researcher in cardiovascular disease.What you have taught us over the last 2 decades has changed the way we practice cardiovascular medicine, which has led to saving a lot of lives around the world.These past few days, you had 3 articles published in a leading medical journal, the New England Journal of Medicine.I am going to ask you some questions about these articles.First, Professor Yusuf, what led to doing those trials?",
