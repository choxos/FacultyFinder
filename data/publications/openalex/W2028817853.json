In 1989 Ahlering and Skinner described their experience with 12 patients. We now update this experience with the most recent followup on 19 patients. Materials and Methods: From April 1978 to May 1995, 19 men underwent retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for stage B3 (N3) or C (N3, M+) germ cell tumor after induction chemotherapy. In all cases the inferior vena cava was resected because of extensive thrombosis or direct involvement of the vessel wall by a tumor. The inferior vena cava was resected from just below the renal veins to beyond the level of disease involvement. Complete resection of retroperitoneal disease was accomplished in all patients. Morbidity and mortality were examined. Results: The mean hospital stay was 10 days (range 7 to 13) for uncomplicated recoveries (9 patients) versus 19 days (range 6 to 32) for complicated recoveries (10 patients). Followup ranged from 1 month to 16 years. Complications included prolonged ileus, small bowel obstruction, fascial dehiscence and pneumonia with pleural effusion. Chronic edema persisted in 3 of 11 patients with followup of greater than 6 months. Of the 6 patients who died of disease recurrence 4 did not have normalization of tumor markers before surgery, and all 4 had persistence of cancer in the resected specimen. Seven patients are without disease at followup of 24 months to 16 years. All survivors had normalized tumor markers before surgery. Only 1 patient (5%) had retroperitoneal recurrence. Conclusions: En bloc vena caval resection for tumor involvement or extensive thrombosis can be associated with short and long-term morbidity, is feasible, and may contribute to a prolonged tumor-free interval and a chance for cure.
