  "title": "Psychology and economic injustice: personal, professional, and political intersections",
  "abstract": "Social class is a powerful contributor to physical, social, and mental well-being. Psychology and Economic Injustice: Personal, Professional, and Political Intersections, which is part of a series on critical social issues addressed by psychologists empirically, politically, and in clinical practice, blends the personal experiences of feminist psychologists with empirical data. It argues persuasively for examining the relationship between economic disparity and gender, and for the need to propose and support policies to ensure positive social change. Authors Bernice Lott and Heather E. Bullock present narratives of their experiences as psychologists who grew up in working class and low-income families. They trace the relationship between their own development as feminist psychologists and their concern with social and economic justice. Drawing from diverse sources, they present data on social class and poverty, and tie these to social psychology and feminist perspectives. Empirical literature is described to illustrate the injustices faced by families in what is described as similar to racism in America-classism. The volume ends with recommendations for policy, education, further research, and citizen advocacy, while moving from psychology to state and federal issues. Researchers and practitioners in psychology, sociology, social work, or education, with an interest in social problems, gender issues, and multiculturalism, will find this to be a noteworthy contribution to the field.",
