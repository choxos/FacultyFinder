One of the new Bruccoli Clark reference volumes, this 11J4\" x 9\" book is designed for library acquisition and use, and will be espe­ cially helpful for students and all interested “general” readers. Writers of American fiction during the artistically fomenting period between the end of the Civil War and the start of World War I are the subjects of this particular volume. Rich in photographs and manuscript samples, the book is attractively designed, and written by numerous well-recognized authorities in this field. Considering that volumes in this series are meant to be introductory, No. 12 is rather thorough. Major writers, such as Clemens, Wharton, and James, receive really extensive treatment;important writers, such as Glasgow, Chopin, Bierce, and Henry Adams, receive detailed treatment; and a host of minor figures, from Lafcadio Hearn to Brand Whitlock, receive substantial ...",
