  "title": "The PURE study and the enigmatic aspects of the diet: is it possible that an high saturated fat consumption would not be harmful?",
  "abstract": "Abstract According to the results of a recent observational epidemiologic study, the PURE study, an elevated consumption of saturated fats in the diet would not be detrimental for the cardiovascular risk, and would not increase all-causes-mortality. A part for the criticism the study received, for being conducted in eastern countries and mainly in rural settings, its results are substantially in agreement with the most recent epidemiological literature, which gradually redefined the pro-atherogenic role of the saturated fats. It is possible that this type of fats, in this instance, would have a limited and restricted effect, and rather represent the overall effect of the foodstuff in which they abound, in the prevalent dietetic habits of the population studied. The results of the PURE study can be integrated with little difficulties, with the recent revision of the role of the alimentary fats in determining cardiovascular risk and all-causes-mortality. The revision doesnâ€™t support (assuming adequate calories and weight control) a limitation of the total dietary fats, saturated fats in particular. An excessive reduction of saturated fats, particularly in Europe, could lead to an unnecessary and unsolicited limitation of certain foods (most commonly cheese), whose final impact on overall health is favourable.",
