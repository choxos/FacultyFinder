  "title": "Workplace Supports in Practice",
  "abstract": "This study investigated the ways in which workplace supports are conceptualized and implemented by four organizations that provide supported employment services. Data were collected during 2-day site visits at each organization. Site visits included observations at a total of 39 work sites, semistructured interviews with a total of 126 primary stakeholders (supported employees, coworkers, employers/supervisors, and agency employment staff), document analysis (e.g., program descriptions, training and marketing materials), and a brief written survey about supported employment beliefs and practices. The findings indicate that each agency was driven by strong leadership and a cohesive vision and values. Each organization had a history of innovation and change. Staff were generally well trained, committed, and professional, and worked collaboratively with each other and with businesses. The involvement of workplace (or natural) supports was promoted in each organization, but there were a wide variety of interpretations and practices among staff. This article highlights areas with which these organizations struggle, including serving people with high support needs, developing a strong emphasis on person-centered approaches to planning and service delivery, assisting staff to facilitate workplace supports and social relationships, actively involving job seekers in the job search process, and increasing work hours and responsibilities of supported employees.",
