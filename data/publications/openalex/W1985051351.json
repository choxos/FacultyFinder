E-mail: almasy@darwin.sfbr.org Published online in Wiley InterScience (www.interscience.wiley.com) DOI: 10.1002/gepi.10278 n INTRODUCTION The Genetic Analysis Workshops (GAWs) began in 1982 as a collaborative effort among researchers of various disciplines to evaluate and compare statistical genetics methods. For each GAW, one or more topics are chosen that relate to current analytical and methodological issues in statistical genetics of complex phenotypes. For each work- shop, sets of simulated and real data are dis- tributed to researchers worldwide who submit the results of their analyses of these data for pre- sentation at GAW. The workshop itself is a 2 12 -day meeting comparing and contrasting the many different approaches used to analyze the data. New methods are introduced, old methods are evaluated in new contexts, and diverse analytical schemes are explored on the level playing field of a common data set. More information about GAW, including details of upcoming workshops, may be found at http://www.sfbr.org/external/gaw/ welcome.html. GAW13 was held November 11–14, 2002, in New Orleans, Louisiana. The 117 contributions sub- mitted to GAW13 were organized into 11 pre- sentation groups of 6–14 papers each. Within each group, a co-author with previous GAW experience was asked to serve as group leader to facilitate group discussion, organize an oral presentation for the group, and take the lead in writing the group summary papers collected in this volume. Eight presentation groups were organized around com- mon methodological themes: derived phenotypes, & 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc. methods for longitudinal analysis, consistency of genetic analyses across time, missing data and pedigree or genotyping errors, effects of covari- ates, pleiotropy and multivariate analyses, data mining/neural networks/tree-based methods, and development and extension of linkage methods. The remaining three presentation groups con- tained papers united by a common focus on particular phenotypes: analysis of blood pressure and hypertension phenotypes, analysis of obesity/ diabetes/lipid phenotypes, and analysis of tobacco and alcohol phenotypes. Of the original 117 GAW13 contributions, 101 were published as a supplement to BMC Genetics [Almasy et al., 2003]. It is these 101 peer-reviewed, published papers that are summarized in the present volume. Summaries have long been a part of the GAW proceedings. For many years, a single individual was charged with the Herculean task of summar- izing all the GAW contributions, using a particular data set. As of GAW11, there were as many as 67 individual contributions to be summarized for a given data set, and the task was divided among pairs of individuals. With the increasing GAW participation, it also became increasingly difficult to accommodate individual oral presentation of each paper within the schedule of the workshop. For GAW12, a new format was introduced both for workshop presentations and for summary papers. Individual contributions with common themes were assigned to presentation groups that had a single oral presentation at the work- shop. In the GAW12 proceedings [Wijsman et al.,",
