  "title": "A new heterozygous mutation in <i><scp>GP</scp>1<scp>BA</scp></i> gene responsible for macrothrombocytopenia",
  "abstract": "Congenital macrothrombocytopenias are a heterogeneous group of rare inherited disorders characterized by decreased platelets count with enlarged platelet size. However, patients with isolated macrothrombocytopenia are often misdiagnosed with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and wrongly treated with immunoglobulin injections, steroids and splenectomy. Bernard-Soulier Syndrome (BSS) is a bleeding disorder caused by defects in the platelet glycoprotein GPIb/IX/V complex, a receptor for von Willebrand factor (VWF) and thrombin. Patients present with macrothrombocytopenia and their platelets do not agglutinate in response to ristocetin, while maintaining a normal aggregation in response to a variety of aggregating agents. GPIb/IX/V complex consists of two GPIbα and four GPIbβ subunits stabilized by disulfide bonds (Luo et al, 2007). This heterodimer is non-covalently associated with two GPIX and one GPV subunits. The N-terminal residues of GPIbα form seven leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and include the binding sites for VWF and thrombin. BSS is due to homozygous mutations in GP1BA, GP1BB or GP9 genes, encoding the components of the GPIb/IX/V complex (Savoia et al, 2014). However, some families with hereditary macrothrombocytopenia and mild or no bleeding diathesis were described with heterozygous mutations in both the GP1BA (Savoia et al, 2001; Vettore et al, 2008) and/or GP1BB genes (Kunishima et al, 2001; Savoia et al, 2014). These patients show mild thrombocytopenia with slightly increased mean platelet volume (MPV), a variable percentage of giant platelets, a modest decrease of cell-surface expression of the GPIb/IX/V complex, sometimes leading to a reduced aggregation in response to ristocetin. However, due to the absence or paucity of biological signs, the use of gene sequencing is mandatory to pinpoint the GPIb complex involvement. The International Consortium for the Study of Clinical and Molecular Aspects of BSS described 60 gene variations in GP1BA (28%), 59 in GP1BB (28%) and 92 in GP9 (44%) (Savoia et al, 2014). Most of these variations (85%) were homozygous and most cases were products of consanguineous marriages. The most common reported variation is a GP1BA missense mutation, leading to an amino acid substitution (Ala172Val), known as the Bolzano variant, located in the sixth LRR (Savoia et al, 2001). Here, we describe a French family with a new mutation in GP1BA gene located in the fifth LRR. The propositus presented with mild thrombocytopenia (89 × 109/l) with large platelets (MPV: 13·1 fl; Advia®, Siemens, Munchen, Germany) without bleeding diathesis. Platelets aggregated normally with ADP and collagen but agglutination response to 1·25 mg/ml ristocetin and the GPIb/IX/V complex platelet surface expression were modestly decreased (Table 1). RIPA by 1·25 mg/ml (Intensity, %) Normal range: [85–94] RIPA by 1·25 mg/ml (Velocity, %) Normal range: [85–212] GPIb expression (% of control) The propositus' sister exhibited more pronounced bleeding symptoms with menorrhagia, epistaxis, postoperative bleeding that did not require transfusion (Table 1). Both patients had a slightly elevated MPV with 17% large platelets, but no giant platelets on the peripheral blood smear (Table 1, Fig 1A). Pedigree analysis revealed an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, as several members of different generations exhibit macrothrombocytopenia (Supplementary data). Morphologically, bone marrow cells from the propositus revealed small megakaryocytes with reduced and vacuolated cytoplasm (Fig 1B). In vitro study of megakaryocytes derived from peripheral blood CD34+ cells in presence of thrombopoietin and stem cell factor (also termed KIT ligand) revealed a reduced percentage of mature CD41+CD42+ cells in the propositus as compared to control whereas the ploidy level was not affected (Fig 1C). Sanger sequencing of the patient's GP1BA, GP1BB and GP9 genes revealed a novel single nucleotide mutation located in GP1BA (Fig 1D). The substituted residue was highly conserved in GP1BA orthologues from ten distantly related species. This variation was called deleterious by diverse prediction algorithms (Polyphen-2 score 1, SIFT score 0) and was not reported in the ExAC and 1000G databases (Supplementary data). The first reported thrombocytopenic patients with large platelets, slightly reduced aggregation to ristocetin and GPIb/IX/V platelet surface expression carried a monoallelic Ala172Val substitution in GPIbα (Savoia et al, 2001), known as the Bolzano variant. Other monoallelic mutations in the GP1BA gene have since been identified (Savoia et al, 2001; Vettore et al, 2008) and some were also discovered in the GP1BB gene that were associated with macrocytosis though not always with thrombocytopenia (Kunishima et al, 2001; Savoia et al, 2014). Macrothrombocytopenia due to haploinsufficiency of the GP1BB gene is also a finding frequently observed in patients with the diGeorge syndrome (del22q11) (Liang et al, 2007) but these patients are mainly diagnosed via extra-haematological symptoms. In our laboratory, we sequenced GP1BA, GP1BB and GP9 genes in all patients with mild macrothrombocytopenia and found only one family carrying the substitution of asparagine by a serine at position 150 that has not yet been listed by the International Consortium for the Study of Clinical and Molecular Aspects of BSS. Thus, in contrast to the Bolzano variant, our results do not support a mutational founder effect. Like the Bolzano variant, we have observed a variable phenotype among the mutation carriers despite similar platelet phenotype. A combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors may explain the discrepancies, such as gender. Indeed, the individual with the highest bleeding score predominantly suffered from gynaecological and obstetrical bleeding. Balduini et al (2009) showed that megakaryocyte maturation was not affected in subjects with monoallelic Bolzano mutation while proplatelet formation was severely reduced in vitro. In this study, the maturation was evaluated according to the morphology of CD34+ derived megakaryocytes at day 12. We observed fewer megakaryocytes (CD41+CD42+ cells) at day 13 of culture without reduction of modal ploidy. Those results are consistent with those described in a murine model of BSS (Ware et al, 2000). We reported here a new monoallelic mutation in the GP1BA gene that slows down megakaryocyte differentiation without reducing polyploidization. A diagnosis of monoallelic BSS should be suspected in cases of rather moderate thrombocytopenia with a dominant transmission pattern. The important element is the presence of macroplatelets (>10%) with only a few, even no, giant platelets (<5%). These two criteria, associated with discrete quantitative and qualitative alterations of the GPIb/IX/V complex, may help to orient the diagnosis towards a defect in the GPIb/IX/V complex.
