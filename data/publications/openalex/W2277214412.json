  "title": "Decision Making Style in Islam: A Study of Superiority of Shura(Participative Management) and Examples from Early Era of Islam",
  "abstract": "Shura or Consultative Management is as a toll to arrive at a consensus on management decision of great importance to the community or organization rather than on routine daily decision of the organization. The holy prophet Mohammad (saw) and his immediate successors ran the administration of the polity with the aid and advice of men having acumen in matters religious, social, economic and political. The consultation must be trustworthy. But if the matters relates to the mundane affairs of the believers for which counsel is sought, then the consultant should be wise enough to give a sound opinion. Modern management thinkers and practitioners can find many lessons about decision making from the events of the golden era of Islam. It is expected that present study will indicate the fact that the Shura or consultative management is a toll which ensure not only the better management, but also ensure the peace, cooperation, coexistence and progress of the organization as well as positive impacts to the society. It is concluded that decision making style of consultative management in Islam produces much shared value for all aspect which is bigger challenging in conventional management practices.
