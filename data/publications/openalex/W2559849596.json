  "title": "B10-D Current and Bereaved Caregiver Perceptions of a Psychoeducation Program",
  "abstract": "Informal caregivers (CG) of persons with dementia can experience increased negative effects and symptoms of burden as the disease progresses, with long-term effects into bereavement. The purpose of this study is to describe staff and attendees’ perceptions’ of a unique CG psychoeducation program called the ‘Family Forum’ located in a Specialized Care Unit (SCU) for persons with advanced dementia at end-of-life. This study used a qualitative descriptive design, which aims to accurately describe a natural experience or event. Fourteen individual interviews with current and bereaved CGs who jointly participate in the program, health professionals in the SCU and program facilitators were conducted to understand participant experiences, perceived benefits and barriers to attending the program. Thematic content analysis was conducted, concurrent with data collection following Research Ethics Board approval. Preliminary results support the program across all participant groups. Participants described how the program contributed to positive outcomes, such as improved emotional well-being, developing and maintaining a close sense of community and empowering participants through formal and informal learning. Unique facilitators of the program include an open-ended format with continuity into bereavement, education and champion members/ eaders. The unique characteristics of this psychoeducation program provide contrast from traditional education/support programs, which are closed to bereaved members and time-limited. This program model is translatable to multiple settings including long-term care. Positive perceived outcomes support movement towards relationship-centered care for persons with dementia and their CGs with relative improved experience. Timing of the program is critical for CGs vulnerable to social isolation, chronic sorrow and complicated grief. Further content analysis will delineate themes. A future mixed-method study is warranted.",
