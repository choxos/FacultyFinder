  "title": "AN OVERVIEW ON PHARMACEUTICAL EXCIPIENTS- THEIR ROLES AND APPLICATIONS",
  "abstract": "Excipients play an important role in formulating a dosage form. These are the ingredients which along with Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients make up the dosage forms. Excipients act as protective agents, bulking agents and can also be used to improve bioavailability of drugs in some instances; the following review discusses the various types of excipients along with their uses. The objective of this paper is to indicate the ingredients that possess health effect that can be found in cosmetics and personal care products. The related paper was reviewed in terms of the chemicals that commonly identified in the cosmetic and personal care product. This paper also highlighted the health risk possesses by such ingredients in the products. As we know that dosage form is a combination of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and excipients therefore it is clear that any pharmaceutical dosage forms cannot be formulated without the use of excipients. Excipients are the major part of formulation. They do not show any adverse effect but promotes the therapeutic activity of pharmaceutical product. Synthetic excipients have some toxic properties so the uses of natural excipients are coming in the picture. This review shows the uses of natural excipients in modern time and in medicinal sciences.",
