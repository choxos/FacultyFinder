  "title": "Barriers to Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Latin America",
  "abstract": "Background: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a prevalent cardiovascular disease worldwide, with a significant impact on mortality and morbidity. In the last decade, TAVI has emerged not only as a valuable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) but as the best standard of care for a certain population with AS. Its use is limited by medical conditions and environmental, social, and economic issues. Statistics show that this procedure is performed significantly less in Latin-America compared to North-America or Europe, although no reason has been identified yet.Methods: We developed the Undone TAVI Survey, a project initiated by the Latin American Society of Interventional Cardiology (SOLACI) to provide reliable information about screened patients with AS who are candidates for TAVI but did not receive an endoprosthesis by this technique.Findings: Our research showed that most of TAVI procedures in Latin America were performed in private practice and hospitals, in which the medical expenses were paid by patients themselves. Of all of the patients evaluated by the heart team in the valve clinic, one-fifth did not receive a transcatheter valve, suggesting that the cost of the prosthesis was the main impeding reason. Economic factors and the lack of medical insurance were found to be the main reasons that TAVI procedures were not conducted in up to 71% of centers.Interpretation: There is a need to facilitate cost coverage for TAVI in Latin America and with it, the number of procedures could increase by at least 20%.Funding: SOLACI provided support to complete the survey.Declaration of Interest: Pablo Lamelas reported TAVR proctoring and consulting from Boston Scientific, Medtronic, Meril, Abbott and Edwards Lifesciences. Anibal Damonte reported TAVR proctoring for Medtronic. Ricardo Allende reported TAVR proctoring for Edwards Lifesciences and research grants from Boston Scientific and Medtronic. All other authors have nothing to declare. Ethics Approval: The study is a survey of the data collected by the main centers in Latin America. No patients were involved in the study.",
