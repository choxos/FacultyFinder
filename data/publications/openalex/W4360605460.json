The surgical options for reflux megaureters who developed breakthrough urinary infections while on prophylaxis are temporary diversion (vesicostomy for bilateral and ureterostomy for unilateral megaureters). In cases of obstructed megaureter the options are ureterostomy and refluxing reimplantation. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2021, 46 infants aged 3 and 12 months were referred for surgical management following recurrent pyelonephritis while on prophylaxis (30 infants) and for worsening hydronephrosis (16 infants). There were 32 boys and 14 girls. The diagnosis was bilateral reflux megaureters in 18 and unilateral in 8 children. The other twenty children had bilateral obstructed megaureter in 9 and unilateral in 11 children. The radionuclide renal scan was performed in 43 children, and it showed reflux nephropathy in 35 kidneys with VUR and reduced function of more than 20% in 9/11 obstructed kidneys. A total of 73 megaureters were operated on. The ureteral tortuosity was straightened, and the caliber was reduced when indicated. Each ureter was reimplanted in a short (1 cm) submucosal tunnel, a cuff-nipple ureteral orifice was created in 62/73 ureters. Simple cuff-nipple without submucosal tunnelling in 11 ureters. RESULTS: The postoperative course was uneventful in all children and follow up US & VCUG were done at four months. Thereafter the follow-up continued by the pediatric nephrology service. The post operative US showed improved hydronephrosis in 59/73 kidneys and stable in 14 units. The VCUG showed no evidence of VUR in 58/62 (93%) of the group who had short tunnel and cuff-nipple reimplantation, in 4 ureters the VUR was downgraded to grade II. 10/11 (91%) of the ureters with the cuff-nipple without tunneling showed no evidence of VUR, and one ureter the VUR was grade II. 7 children had significant reflux nephropathy outgrew their renal function and underwent renal transplantation CONCLUSIONS: The time -tested Paquin dogma of tunnel length/width ratio of 5/1 was challenged by Lyons et.al, the latter contention was that the shape of the ureteral orifice (UO) is more important than the length of the tunnel for reflux prevention, (the cuff-nipple creates a volcano like UO). Recently Villaneuva et.al performed a parametric simulation study of ureteral collapse (LS-DYNA finite-element software). They confirmed Lyons observation. These observations would explain the high success rate which was achieved by the cuff-nipple technique.
