Although 12-month continence rates range from 85-95% in the literature, few patients are continent in the early postoperative period. It has been suggested that posterior reconstruction of the Denonvilliers′ musculofascial plate, also known as the Rocco stitch, may improve early return to urinary continence, though clinical equipoise remains. We evaluated short and long-term return to urinary continence post robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) by comparing the Rocco stitch versus conventional urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA). METHODS Patients with clinically localized prostate cancer undergoing RARP were prospectively recruited and randomly allocated to the Rocco stitch (intervention) or conventional UVA (control) groups. Patients were blinded to allocation status, while the surgeon was notified immediately prior to the case. All cases were performed by a single high-volume surgeon at a tertiary healthcare centre. Outcomes were assessed by using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Short Form (EPIC-26) survey at baseline and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12-month follow-up. Pad use and urinary continence scores were compared using the Chi-square and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively. Ordinal generalized estimating equation model assessed the overtime treatment effect of the Rocco stitch on urinary continence. A p-value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS A total of 140 patients prospectively recruited from April 2014 to July 2015 were included in the final analysis. Preoperative clinical and functional variables were equivalent between study arms. Using a continence definition of 0 pads/day, the continence rates for the Rocco stitch versus the control group were 12% versus 11% at 2 months (p=0.80), 28% versus 24% at 3 months (p=0.70), 35% versus 36% at 4 months (p=1.00), 52% versus 53% at 6 months (p=0.86), 58% versus 58% at 8 months (p=1.00), and 65% versus 63% at 12 months (p=1.00). Frequency of urine leak, quantity of pad use, subjective urinary control, and overall bother improved significantly in all patients during the 12-month study period (p<0.001); however, no difference was demonstrated between groups. Erectile function at 12-month follow-up showed similar potency rates for both groups. CONCLUSIONS The Rocco stitch failed to show statistical significance in shortening time to urinary continence post-RARP when compared to conventional UVA. Larger, multi-centre studies are required to support these findings. © 2018FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 199Issue 4SApril 2018Page: e569-e570 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2018MetricsAuthor Information Jennifer Hoogenes More articles by this author Derek Bos More articles by this author Lisa Patterson More articles by this author Yuding Wang More articles by this author Christopher Wu More articles by this author Forough Farrokhyar More articles by this author Bobby Shayegan More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
