  "title": "Archaeological Salvage Research at 41BX901, a Prehistoric Quarry in Bexar County, Texas",
  "abstract": "During the months of October and November, 1990, staff members and volunteers of the Center of Archaeological Research (CAR), The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), conducted surface survey, mapping, subsurface testing and private collection research at 41 BX 901 and surrounding areas. 41 BX 901 is an extensive prehistoric chert stone quarry in northeastern Bexar county, Texas. The site had been selected for construction of a new middle school by the Northeast Independent School District (NEISD). Survey and testing research was performed in order to evaluate 41 BX 901 and to locate any additional archaeological remains which might be affected by school construction and operation. Extensive prehistoric archaeological remains were encountered at 41 BX 901. Surface and subsurface testing at the site produced abundant lithic remains which indicate lithic procurement and the initial stages of tool fabrication took place here during prehistoric times. However, time-diagnostic artifacts were not recovered from 41 BX 901. Chronological placement of the site depends upon neighboring, more securely dated sites which, it is proposed in this report, had a functional relationship with 41 BX 901.",
