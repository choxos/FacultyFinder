  "title": "Individual and Institutional Predictors of IPV/SV Screening in College Health Centers",
  "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) and sexual violence (SV) are significant public health issues for women, particularly for college women. IPV and SV have been associated with numerous adverse health consequences and involvement in unhealthy behaviors. Given the health risks and high rates of IPV/SV among college women, it is important to understand and promote screening in this population. The purpose of this study was to examine college womenâ€™s experiences with IPV/SV screening at college health centers and identify individual and institutional characteristics associated with screening. Random samples of female undergraduate college students from five colleges in the northeast United States were recruited to participate in an anonymous online survey in January 2015. Inclusion criteria included at least one visit to the college health center during the preceding fall semester. Participants were questioned regarding demographics and whether they were screened or asked about IPV/SV at the college health center. A total of 873 women met the inclusion criteria and completed surveys. Only 10.2% of the college women in the study reported that they were screened for IPV/SV at their most recent visit to the college health center. Participants from public colleges/universities were 3 times more likely than others to report screening, whereas participants from urban college/university campuses were more than twice as likely as others to report screening. College women who went to the college health center for a gynecological or sexual health reason were nearly 4 times as likely as other women to report being screened for IPV/SV. Low rates of IPV/SV screening at college health centers represent missed opportunities. Further research across more numerous and diverse college sites is needed to understand the factors that promote or inhibit IPV/SV screening in college health centers to develop interventions to facilitate routine screening practices.",
