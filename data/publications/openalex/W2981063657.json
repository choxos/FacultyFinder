We investigated a novel therapeutic target through screening FDA-approved drugs in ALK-TKI-resistant models. Cerivastatin, the rate-limiting enzyme inhibitor of the mevalonate pathway, showed anti-cancer activity against ALK-TKI resistance in vitro/in vivo, accompanied by cytoplasmic retention and subsequent inactivation of transcriptional co-regulator YAP. The marked induction of YAP-targeted oncogenes (EGFR, AXL, CYR61, and TGFβR2) in resistant cells was abolished by cerivastatin. YAP silencing suppressed tumor growth in resistant cells, patient-derived xenografts, and EML4-ALK transgenic mice, whereas YAP overexpression decreased the responsiveness of parental cells to ALK inhibitor. In matched patient samples before/after ALK inhibitor treatment, nuclear accumulation of YAP was mainly detected in post-treatment samples. High expression of YAP in pretreatment samples was correlated with poor response to ALK-TKIs. Our findings highlight a crucial role of YAP in ALK-TKI resistance and provide a rationale for targeting YAP as a potential treatment option for ALK-rearranged patients with acquired resistance to ALK inhibitors. Synopsis Acquired resistance to targeted therapy is a major challenge in treatment for ALK-rearranged NSCLC. The transcriptional activation of YAP induces multiple resistance factors, conferring acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. Statins represent proxy inhibitors to overcome YAP-mediated drug resistance. ALK-TKIs-resistant cells undergo morphological changes and cell growth in ALK-independent manner. YAP shows a lower phosphorylation levels and predominant nuclear localization in ALK-TKIs-resistant cells. Depletion of YAP suppresses tumor growth and induction of oncogenes such as AXL, EGFR, and TGFβR2 in resistant models. Ectopic expression of wild-type or constitutively active YAP confers resistance to crizotinib. Statins overcome YAP-mediated drug resistance by blocking critical downstream targets of YAP. Introduction Rearrangement of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene defines a distinct clinicopathologic subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and occurs in approximately 3–7% of NSCLC cases, with a higher prevalence among younger, never/light smoker, and adenocarcinoma histology (Shaw et al, 2009). Crizotinib is currently the standard first-line therapy for patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC (Solomon et al, 2014). However, most patients who initially respond to crizotinib invariably relapse within 1 year due to the emergence of drug resistance (Katayama et al, 2015). Recently, more potent second-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed for the treatment of crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-naïve patients, but acquired resistance to these agents is also an inevitable problem (Awad & Shaw, 2014). Based on published reports, the mechanisms of resistance to ALK-TKIs can be broadly classified as ALK-dependent alterations (e.g., ALK secondary mutations and ALK gene amplification) and ALK-independent alterations (e.g., upregulation of bypass signaling pathways; lineage changes; and drug efflux pump) (Katayama et al, 2012; Lin et al, 2017). ALK-dependent mechanisms generally indicate continued dependency on ALK signaling and potential sensitivity to other ALK-TKIs, depending on the type of secondary mutation. In a recent report by Gainor et al (2016), resistance mutations were found in 20 and 50% of patients following treatment with crizotinib and the second-generation ALK-TKIs (e.g., ceritinib and alectinib), respectively. This indicates that at least half of patients exhibit ALK-independent mechanisms upon acquisition of acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs. Several examples of bypass signaling activation have been proposed (Crystal et al, 2014; Hrustanovic et al, 2015), but major mechanisms to explain widespread emergence of resistance are still unknown. Yes-associated protein (YAP), a major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway (Maugeri-Saccà & De Maria, 2018), serves as a transcriptional regulator by facilitating transcription of pro-growth genes and suppressing pro-apoptotic genes. YAP has emerged as a critical oncogene in multiple cancer types (Zanconato et al, 2016; Maugeri-Saccà & De Maria, 2018). In particular, YAP has been reported to be closely associated with the emergence of resistance to conventional chemotherapeutics (Gujral & Kirschner, 2017) and BRAF/MEK/EGFR-targeted therapies (Lin et al, 2015; Lee et al, 2018). However, only a few studies have verified the clinical relevance of YAP activation in human samples. The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is an essential metabolic pathway that produces sterols and isoprenoids that are essential for tumor growth and progression (Mullen et al, 2016). MVA pathway metabolite isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), are necessary for the post-translational prenylation of small GTPases that play a significant role in multiple intracellular signaling pathways. A number of studies have shown that statins, which inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), exhibit anti-cancer effects in many cancers by reducing isoprenoids (Yu et al, 2018). Notably, GGPP has recently been found to activate YAP by inhibiting its phosphorylation and promoting its nuclear accumulation. With this mechanism, statins as antagonists of isoprenylation can inhibit YAP nuclear localization and transcriptional responses, leading to growth arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells (Zhao et al, 2008; Zhang et al, 2009; Sorrentino et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2014; Mi et al, 2015). This study aims to identify novel resistance mechanisms to ALK-TKIs by utilizing high-throughput screening using a library of FDA-approved drugs composed of a collection of 640 clinically used compounds with known and well-characterized bioactivity, safety, and bioavailability. Here, we report a previously unidentified YAP-mediated mechanism of acquired resistance to crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC using in vitro and in vivo models with subsequent validation in patient samples before and/or after ALK inhibitor therapy. Ultimately, our findings provide a novel promising therapeutic strategy targeting YAP signaling to overcome acquired resistance to ALK-TKIs in ALK-positive NSCLC. Results Statins exhibit in vitro and in vivo anti-cancer activity against crizotinib-resistant cells We generated crizotinib-resistant cells (CR cells; CR pool, CR #1 and CR #3) as described in the Materials and Methods. These CR cells exhibited lower phosphorylated and total ALK levels concomitant with morphological changes from round to fibroblast-like cells compared with that of parental cells (Appendix Fig S1A–C). Silencing ALK using small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection and ALK inhibitors ceritinib and lorlatinib had no effect on the growth of CR cells (Appendix Fig S1D and E). Moreover, sequencing of the ALK tyrosine kinase domain of resistant cells showed no secondary ALK mutations. Altogether, CR cells were unlikely to have arisen by ALK-dependent mechanisms. To uncover novel signaling pathways related to crizotinib-acquired resistance, we screened a 640 FDA-approved drug library for drug efficacy in parental and CR pool cells. The average z-score was calculated for drug effect on cell viability. Cerivastatin was the most selective hit for CR pool cells compared with parental cells, and further confirmed a greater decrement in cell viability of other CR cells (CR #1 and CR #3; Fig 1A–C). Considering that cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market in 2001 due to fatal rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure (Furberg & Pitt, 2001), we additionally evaluated the anti-proliferative capability of the other clinically available statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, in CR cells. Although they were used at higher concentrations than cerivastatin, these statins successfully inhibited cell growth at the concentration range reported in other previous preclinical studies (Fig EV1A and Appendix Fig S2A). Cerivastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin remarkably increased the expression levels of c-PARP, c-Cas3, and p21 in CR cells (Fig EV1B, and Appendix Fig S2B). These in vitro findings were further confirmed by in vivo xenograft studies showing that cerivastatin and atorvastatin significantly delayed tumor growth of the CR pool (Figs 1D and EV1C). Based on the anti-cancer effects of statins, cerivastatin with the lowest IC50 was used as a representative in subsequent experiments despite being a clinically discontinued drug. Figure 1.

Among the important metabolites of the MVA pathway, the addition of MVA and GGPP was able to rescue cerivastatin-induced cell growth inhibition in CR cells, whereas FPP and squalene had no effect (Fig 1E). Addition of GGPP markedly abrogated cerivastatin- and atorvastatin-induced c-PARP, c-Cas3, and p21 expression in CR pool, but not in parental cells (Figs 1F and EV1D). Conversely, geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 was able to reproduce the effects of statin by increasing the expression of c-PARP, c-Cas3, and p21 in CR cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig 1F). However, farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 only weakly increased p21 expression and we failed to detect c-PARP and c-Cas3 levels (Appendix Fig S4). Reportedly, the MVA pathway is associated with mutant p53 expression in a variety of cancer types (Freed-Pastor et al, 2012; Sorrentino et al, 2014; Parrales et al, 2016; Turrell et al, 2017). However, there was no difference in the p53 mutational status between H3122 parental and resistant cells (Appendix Table S1). These results suggest that anti-cancer activity of statin in resistant cells may be independent of TP53 mutation. Cerivastatin decreases upregulation of multiple oncogenic factors by inactivating YAP Given that the MVA-GGPP axis is involved in cancer progression by activating the transcriptional co-regulator YAP as a Hippo pathway downstream effector (Zhao et al, 2008; Zhang et al, 2009; Sorrentino et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2014; Mi et al, 2015), we investigated the relevance of the YAP signaling pathway in crizotinib resistance. Figure 2A showed that CR pool cells exhibited a lower level of basal YAP phosphorylation and a significant nuclear accumulation of YAP compared with that of parental cells, indicating an increase in the transcriptional activity of YAP. Treatment with cerivastatin and atorvastatin (Figs 2A and EV1E) resulted in a robust increase in YAP phosphorylation and translocation of nuclear YAP into the cytoplasm, which was reversed by the addition of GGPP. Despite depletion of endogenous expression of the Hippo pathway core component LATS1/2 by siRNA, moreover, YAP was still phosphorylated upon treatment with cerivastatin, and dephosphorylated after the addition of GGPP (Appendix Fig S5). These results suggest that cerivastatin inhibits GGPP-mediated YAP activation in a Hippo pathway-independent manner. Figure 2. GGPP-mediated yes-associated protein (YAP) activation A.

Based on functional enrichment analysis, interaction network analysis between YAP and genes belonging to the top 15 signaling pathways including metabolic pathway, focal adhesion, cytoskeleton pathways, and Ras signaling demonstrated that a number of genes were functionally connected to YAP (Fig 2C). In particular, we focused on EGFR, AXL, and TGFβR2, which are known to be involved in drug resistance (Miyawaki et al, 2017; Yun et al, 2018), as well as CYR61, which is a direct YAP target. Upregulation of these genes in CR pool cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig 2D). We also found that the expression levels of vimentin (VIM), cyclin D1, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), and the MAPK phosphatase DUSP6 varied depending on the CR clones, indicating heterogeneity in the resistant clones (Appendix Fig S7A). YAP inhibition with siRNAs markedly suppressed the expression of EGFR, AXL, TGFβR2, and CYR61, but had no effect on expression levels of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated gene VIM and tumor suppressor genes IGFBP3 and DUSP6 (Fig 2E and Appendix Fig S7B). Verteporfin (VP), a pharmacological inhibitor of YAP, is known to inhibit YAP transcriptional activity by preventing the interaction of YAP and TEA domain family members (Liu-Chittenden et al, 2012; Yu et al, 2014). Treatment with VP, cerivastatin, or GGTI-298 also showed similar results (Fig 2F). Given that YAP and its paralogue transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are known to be functionally redundant and similarly regulated by Hippo signaling (Zhang et al, 2009; Moroishi et al, 2015), we further determined the role of TAZ in our system. Unlike YAP, TAZ knockdown did not affect the expression of EGFR, AXL, and TGFβR2, but robustly inhibited CYR61 and VIM expression and increased IGFBP3 expression (Fig EV2 and Appendix Fig S7). These results suggest that there are potential differences between YAP and TAZ in the context of ALK-TKI resistance. Click here to expand this figure. Figure EV2.

Download figure Download PowerPoint YAP activation promotes resistance to ALK-TKI in vitro and in vivo We next examined whether YAP, the target of cerivastatin identified from the drug screen, is a novel target of ALK resistance. To this end, we established the following three stable cell lines from H3122 cell line: (i) endogenous YAP-expressing pLVX cell line as control, (ii) YAP-WT cell line overexpressing wild-type YAP, and (iii) YAP-S127A cell line overexpressing constitutively active YAP. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that YAP was successfully overexpressed in both YAP-WT and YAP-S127A cells. Phosphorylated levels of YAP in YAP-S127A cells were the lowest among the three stable cell lines (Fig EV3A). YAP-WT and YAP-S127A cells exhibited markedly reduced susceptibility to crizotinib concomitant with upregulation of CYR61, EGFR, and AXL expression (Fig EV3A and B). Click here to expand this figure.

Download figure Download PowerPoint To clarify the functional role of YAP in ALK-TKI resistance in vivo, pLVX, YAP-WT, and YAP-S127A cells were injected subcutaneously into nude mice. Tumor xenografts derived from YAP-WT and YAP-S127A cells grew faster than those from pLVX cells. On day 21 of tumor growth, tumor volumes of the YAP-S127A xenograft were the largest, indicating a potential role of active YAP on tumor progression (Fig 3A). Consistent with the in vitro findings, anti-tumor efficacy of crizotinib was remarkably reduced in both YAP-WT and YAP-S127A tumors. Treatment with cerivastatin significantly suppressed tumor growth in YAP-WT (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle) and YAP-S127A xenografts (P < 0.05 vs. vehicle), but not in pLVX xenograft (Fig 3B). Notably, the combined treatment of cerivastatin and crizotinib produced a potent anti-tumor synergy compared with that of crizotinib (P < 0.05) or cerivastatin alone (P < 0.05) in YAP-WT xenograft. Interestingly, YAP-S127A xenograft was less responsive to cerivastatin compared with YAP-WT x",
