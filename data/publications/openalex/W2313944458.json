Its curricular materials have been modified to meet the needs of a group of more novice learners during their introduction to clinical care. The workshop includes a 60-minute didactic and interactive session that is devoted to team training in structured communication techniques and to the teaching of a standardized approach to the handoff process, including the integration of verbal and written handoff components. Key structured team communication techniques and the I-PASS mnemonic are taught in detail and reinforced with the use of trigger videos and large group discussion. The final 30-minutes of the workshop are devoted to two handoff simulations exercises. The handoff simulation exercises feature interactive role plays in which participants (in groups of two or three) gain hands-on experience and practice the I-PASS handoff technique under the supervision of a faculty member or senior resident. Similar in content to the I-PASS Handoff Core Resident Workshop, this workshop has been tailored to fit the needs of medical students as novice clinicians with limited clinical experience and emerging medical knowledge. This curriculum was implemented for third- and fourth-year medical students during their inpatient pediatric rotations from June — December 2013 at six medical schools and pediatric hospitals across North America including: (1) University of Cincinnati College of Medicine/Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center; (2) UCSF School of Medicine/Benioff Children's Hospital; (3) University of Utah School of Medicine/Primary Children's Medical Center; (4) Drexel University College of Medicine/St. Christopher's Hospital for Children; (5) University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine/Hospital for Sick Children; and (6) Stanford University School of Medicine/Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. Educational Objectives By the end of the module, learners will be able to: Describe the importance of effective communication in reducing medical errors.Detail the essential content and sequence of effective handoffs.Apply effective team training strategies to improve handoffs.Practice handoff skills.
