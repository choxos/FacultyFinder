There is an unmet need for risk-stratification tools for early detection of lethal phenotypes for all patients and black men in particular. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in signature extraction for the prediction of cancer progression; however, AI models underperform on patients from underprivileged groups. PATHOMIQ_PRAD is a previously validated AI-based tool that identifies clinically significant histological patterns from whole slide images (WSIs) to predict patient outcome. Here, we show that PATHOMIQ_PRAD performs equally well with black men as it does with white men. METHODS: 215 radical prostatectomy samples were collected from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai to form a held-out test set. Each sample included a digitized H&E WSI, CAPRA-S score, and retrospective time-to-metastasis (MET). A subset of 147 patients also had an associated genomic score. Racial stratification of the test set was 40.7% (n=87) Black, 51.4% (n=110) White, and 7.9% (n=17) other. PATHOMIQ_PRAD was used to produce a risk score for each sample by analyzing the associated WSI. Concordance index (CI) was used to measure the performance of predicting MET. Hazard ratios (HR) for patients in each racial group were measured by stratifying between high and low risk, as determined by PATHOMIQ_PRAD. ROIs were analyzed by spatial transcriptomics using NanoString GeoMx DSP WTA platform. RESULTS: PATHOMIQ_PRAD predicted MET with a CI of 0.782 on the whole test set, 0.879 on the Black patient subset, and 0.769 on the White patient subset. HR for Black patients was 7.977 (p<0.01); White patients was 7.921 (p<0.01). On the subset of samples with an associated genomic score and CAPRA-Score, PATHOMIQ_PRAD outperformed both methods in predicting MET (CI: PATHOMIQ_PRAD, 0.850; CAPRA-S, 0.669; Genomic score, 0.708). ROI guided GeoMx RNA and Protein Assay (NanoString Technologies) identified known PCa biomarkers including androgen receptor (AR) target genes in the high-risk ROIs. CONCLUSIONS: PATHOMIQ_PRAD successfully predicted MET in patients with prostate cancer, with better performance in black patients. PATHOMIQ_PRAD significantly outperformed the genomic score and CAPRA-S in predicting MET in PCa patients. Further, the identification of molecular drivers of lethal phenotypes may lead to novel therapeutic targets against aggressive PCa in black men. Source of Funding: The Arthur M.
