Holmium laser fiber passage can damage the working channel of a fully flexed ureteroscope. A recently released ball-tip laser fiber (TracTip - Boston Scientific) features a modified tip to reduce scope trauma. We compared ureteroscope deflection and insertion forces of this ball tip to a standard laser fiber. METHODS Ureteroscope deflection was measured using a 200 μm ball-tip (BT) and standard fiber (SF) (Flexiva - Boston Scientific) with two fiber optic and one digital ureteroscope (URF-P5, URF-P6, URF-V - Olympus). The ureteroscopes were flexed/extended empty and with each fiber for 4 consecutive runs. Deflection angle was measured using AutoCAD software. Insertion force was measured in a ureteroscope sheath positioned in a 270° curve. The BT and SF fibers were advanced using a stage controller and a strain gauge measured force. ANOVA test was used to compare multiple groups and t-test was used for intergroup comparison with a Bonferroni correction as applicable. RESULTS Both fibers caused reduced but equivalent reduction (10-30°) in ureteroscope flexion/extension in all three models with no statistical difference (Figure 1). Four virgin fibers and ureteroscope sheaths were used to test insertion force of each fiber. The maximum and average insertion force for the SF was 998 ±394 mN and 603 ±163 mN respectively. The BT insertion forces were approximately 1/3 of the SF; 304 ±31 mN maximum and 213 ±31 mN mean insertion force (p = 0.040, 0.025 respectively). One SF fiber caused significant damage to the sheath and could not be advanced completely (Figure 2). CONCLUSIONS The ball-tip fiber has markedly reduced force of insertion in a deflected ureteroscope without compromising maneuverability compared to a standard laser fiber. Minimal investment in the ball-tip fiber may result in cost savings by reducing working channel damage and increasing ureteroscope longevity. © 2014FiguresReferencesRelatedDetailsCited byKronenberg P and Traxer O (2018) Lithotripsy Performance of Specially Designed Laser Fiber TipsJournal of Urology, VOL. 195, NO. 5, (1606-1612), Online publication date: 1-May-2016.
