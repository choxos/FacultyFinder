METHODS From 2009-17, we prospectively screened 1198 patients with HN. Patients =12mos old at presentation and diagnosed with grades I-IV SFU HN were included (770). Medical records lacking BF information (390), genitourinary anomalies (78) and those >12mos (289) at baseline were excluded, resulting in 302 included infants. Baseline patient demographics, BF history (age BF stopped, % BF), fUTI rates, SFU grades, CAP status, gender and circumcision status were captured. The primary outcome was UTI rate. Univariate and multivariate analyses of predetermined UTI risk factors were conducted. RESULTS Of 302 infants, 241(80%) were male, 153(63%) were uncircumcised, and 139(46%) had high-grade (III-IV) SFU HN. Overall, 34(11%) developed UTI. 35(11%) babies received formula only, 135(45%) had breast milk and formula, and 132(44%) were breastfed exclusively. Of BF patients, 198(74%) were breastfed for ≥6mos. Breastfeeding had no protective effect on the rate of fUTI in this population regardless of the intensity or duration. Not being prescribed CAP (16% vs.7%, p=0.03) and having either primary non refluxing megaureter or VUR as opposed to UPJO-like (28%, 17% vs. 6%, p=<0.01) were found to be associated with risk of developing a UTI (table 1). On multivariate analysis all these three factors were again independent driving factors for UTI (table 2). CONCLUSIONS Although there is a theoretical protective effect of breastfeeding on preventing infections, in our cohort of infants with HN no protective effect was seen for fUTI. CAP and etiology of the HN were the most important driving factors. BF is a critical intervention with multiple health benefits, however UTI prevention may not be one of them. © 2018FiguresReferencesRelatedDetails Volume 199Issue 4SApril 2018Page: e930 Advertisement Copyright & Permissions© 2018MetricsAuthor Information Melissa McGrath More articles by this author Forough Farrokhyar More articles by this author Smruthi Ramesh More articles by this author Armando Lorenzo More articles by this author Luis Braga More articles by this author Expand All Advertisement Advertisement PDF downloadLoading ...",
