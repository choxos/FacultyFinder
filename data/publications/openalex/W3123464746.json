  "title": "Handbook of Labor Economics",
  "abstract": "This handbook comprises two volumes: 'Developments in research methods and their applications' (volume 4A) and 'New developments and research on labor markets' (volume 4B). The purpose is to examine what new tools and models economists can use to understand how individuals participate in labor markets. Using a mixture of conceptual models and empirical research, the contributors demonstrate how better data and advanced experiments help them apply economic theory, producing better analyses and conclusions. The chapters show how labor economists are developing new and innovative ways to measure key parameters and test important hypotheses. Volume 4A contains the following chapters: Decomposition methods in economics / Nicole Fortin, Thomas Lemieux, Sergio Firpo; Field experiments in labor economics / John A. List, Imran Rasul; Lab labor: what can labor economists learn from the lab? / Gary Charness, Peter Kuhn; The structural estimation of behavioral models: discrete choice dynamic programming methods and applications / Michael P. Keane, Petra E. Todd, Kenneth I. Wolpin; Program evaluation and research designs / John DiNardo, David S. Lee; Identification of models of the labor market / Eric French, Christopher Taber; Search in macroeconomic models of the labor market / Richard Rogerson, Robert Shimer; Extrinsic rewards and intrinsic motives: standard and behavioral approaches to agency and labor markets / James B.
