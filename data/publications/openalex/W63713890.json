  "abstract": "Public and private school collaboration is one approach to educational reform that may be working in many schools across the country. The Forum for Public and Private Collaboration is committed to publicizing successful collaborative efforts while providing an outlet for educators involved in collaboration to share ideas and receive help. The 1996-97 research team for the Forum has concentrated on these goals. Goals of the Forum were promoted through the establishment of a Web site as a step toward developing and disseminating a theoretical basis for discussions of collaboration. A survey of collaborative programs resulted in preparation of case studies. Case studies are presented of collaborative efforts at Peninsula Bridge (California), ASCENT (a summer outreach program in Tennessee), and Summit School and South Park High School, Winston Salem (North Carolina), and of two discontinued collaborative efforts. A review of these studies leads to the conclusion that six characteristics are crucial to successful collaboration: (1) mission; (2) real activity; (3) funding and resources; (4) open boundaries; (5) assessment; and (6) leadership. While these do not seem to occur in any particular order of importance, they all need to be present at some level for collaboration to be effective. An appendix describes the establishment of the Forum's Web site and gives some examples of its exchanges. A second appendix presents the school survey.
