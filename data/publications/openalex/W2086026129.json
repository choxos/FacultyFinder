  "title": "A Call to Action from Social Workers around the Mandatory Minimum",
  "abstract": "One of the greatest aspects of the social work profession is the accountability and standards of the NASW Code of Ethics. As agents of change, social workers use social justice and service to decrease the disparities among individuals. It has been well documented and known that there are racial disparities in the criminal justice system as well as in the foster care system. There has been an alarming increase in the incarceration of African American women, and African American children make up a disproportionate ratio in foster care. Aside from racial profiling, the lack of rehabilitative services, the war on the poor, and the ever-growing epidemic of substance use are crumbling the remains of households and communities. Substance use and misuse has been historically deemed a moral issue, and the consequence has been, and still is, criminal court. In 1986, mandatory minimums were put into place by the Anti-Drug Act of 1986. This federal act aimed at decreasing the amounts of crack and drug trafficking in communities. It sought out drug traffickers, but, with any act, the unintended consequences were alarming. The act enacted mandatory minimums and took power from judges. Judges were no longer able to judge on a case-by-case basis but had to adhere to the minimums. If an individual is caught with five grams of crack cocaine, he or she will receive five to 10 years in jail. If an individual is caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine, he or she will receive five to 10 years in jail. There is an obvious disproportionate sentencing ratio. There is an obvious class differentiation between crack and cocaine users. A majority of individuals affected by this act were low-level nonviolent crack users. A majority of these individuals are low-income African Americans.",
