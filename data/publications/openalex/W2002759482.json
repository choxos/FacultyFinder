  "title": "The Impact of Type of Employment on Women's Use of Prenatal-Care Services and Family Planning in Urban Cebu, the Philippines",
  "abstract": "This study re-evaluates the relationship of urban women's employment to their health-service and contraceptive use, drawing on data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Multivariate analyses reveal significant differences across types of work for the likelihood of both obtaining timely prenatal care and practicing contraception at one year postpartum. Wage workers in white-collar jobs are significantly more likely than those not employed for pay to have obtained prenatal care and are substantially more likely to have adopted a contraceptive method in the year following childbirth. Women who are self-employed also are significantly more likely than those not employed for pay to be using contraceptives. Blue-collar wage work and piecework employment have no relationship to either dependent variable. These findings suggest that work-related autonomy encourages women to exercise control in other areas of their lives.This article examined the relationship between women's employment and use of prenatal care services and family planning in Cebu, the Philippines. Data were obtained from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Baseline and Follow-up Survey among a 12-month birth cohort of 2695 Filipino infants and their mothers, residing in a sample of 33 urban and rural barangays in 1983 and 1984. The largest percentage of women who had early prenatal care were white collar workers (WCWs) and professionals (57%), followed by blue collar, service, and self-employed workers (22%), and non-wage workers (23%). The smallest percentage of women obtaining prenatal care were pieceworkers (15%). Modern contraceptive use at 1 year postpartum was greatest among WCWs (34%), followed by self-employed workers (32%) and non-wage workers (26%). The lowest proportion were pieceworkers among modern method users, and blue collar workers and service workers among traditional method users. Logistic models indicate that WCWs were 2.5 times more likely than non-wage workers to obtain care within the first 5 months of pregnancy. Among women who received free care, WCWs still had the best prenatal care patterns. The likelihood of prenatal care was the same for blue collar workers, self-employed workers, and pieceworkers. Women aged 25-34 years were more likely than older women to obtain early prenatal care. Husband's education, a resident grandmother, and household assets contributed to a higher likelihood of seeking early prenatal care. The degree of autonomy on the job was more closely related to contraceptive and health service use.",
