  "title": "Body-rubbing, marking, and other scent-related behavior in some ground squirrels (Sciuridae), a descriptive study",
  "abstract": "In some ground squirrels, mainly Arctic and Columbian, body-rubbing can be comfort or marking behavior, depending on the context. The mouth-corner apocrine glands are probably involved in individual/group/mother–offspring recognition. These glands are also rubbed against the substrate, particularly by dominant males. This is apparently scent-marking and seems to express territorialism, dominance, and readiness to fight, particularly when accompanied by clawing of the ground, for the latter case. Marking is also performed in neighboring residences, where it frequently involves fighting and chasing away the intruder. The squirrel also rubs its anogenital area against the substrate. A liquid trail (urine? secretion of the anal glands? both?) is left behind, possibly an indicator of sex and (or) reproductive condition. The anal gland papillae pulsate during some agonistic encounters.Extensive scent dissemination and scent-sharing take place between group members and also their habitat. A dorsal-glandular area is also rubbed against the substrate. Both hostile (biting) and friendly (licking, grooming) responses are apparently focused on scent-producing or s cent-bearing body areas.",
