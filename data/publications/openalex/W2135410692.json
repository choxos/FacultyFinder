The PGC of the AUA selected the Panel chair who in turn appointed the additional Panel members with specific expertise in this disease.The mission of the Panel was to develop either analysis- or consensus-based recommendations, depending on the type of evidence available and Panel processes, to support optimal clinical practices in the cryosurgical treatment of localized prostate cancer. This document was submitted to approximately 64 urologists and other health care professionals for peer review. After revision of the document based upon the peer review comments, the best practice statement was submitted to and approved by the PGC and the Board of Directors of the AUA. Funding of the Panel and of the PGC was provided by the AUA, although Panel members received no remuneration for their work. Each member of the PGC and of the Panel furnished a current conflict of interest disclosure to the AUA.The final report is intended to provide medical practitioners with a current understanding of the principles and strategies for the cryosurgical treatment of localized prostate cancer. The report is based on review of available professional literature, as well as clinical experience and expert opinion.This document provides guidance only, and does not establish a fixed set of rules or define the legal standard of care. As medical knowledge expands and technology advances, this best practice statement will change. Today they represent not absolute mandates but provisional proposals or recommendations for treatment under the specific conditions described. For all these reasons, this best practice statement does not preempt physician judgment in individual cases. Also, treating physicians must take into account variations in resources, and in patient tolerances, needs and preferences. Conformance with the best practice statement reflected in this document cannot guarantee a successful outcome.Metrics Author Information Richard J.
