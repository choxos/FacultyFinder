  "title": "Hematuria with bladder tamponade and renal failure due to gallbladder cancer metastasis",
  "abstract": "s / Urological Science 26 (2015) S50eS81 S72 carried at least one C allele at rs187238 had a 2.760efold risk of UCC. However, the rs1946518 and rs187238 polymorphisms of the IL-18 gene did not affect tumor stage among the UCC patients. Conclusion: The rs187238 polymorphic genotypes of IL-18 might contribute to the susceptibility of UCC and the synergic effect of smoking was also demonstrated. NDP086: HEMATURIA WITH BLADDER TAMPONADE AND RENAL FAILURE DUE TO GALLBLADDER CANCER METASTASIS Ching-Ming Su, Chien-Yuan Wang, Hsiu-Nan Tsai, Wei-Che Weng. Department of Urology, Kaohsiung Municiple United Hospital, Taiwan Introduction: There are many possible causes of hematuria including: urinary tract infection, urolithiasis, tumor in kidney or bladder, exercise, drug, bleeding disorder or trauma. Herein we report a case of hematuria with bladder tamponade due to gallbladder cancer metastasis Case report: A 61-year-old women presented with gross hematuria, nausea, vomiting to our ER for help. According to the statement of her, DM, CRI, gallbladder stone, cancer post operation. Sonography revealed bladder tamponade and left hydronephrosis. Due to poor condition, CT scan was performed and revealed much bladder clot, left hydronephrosis, ascites and favored carcinomatosis. Emergent cystoscopy removed blood and bladder tumor was noted. TURBT was performed and pathology revealed gallbladder cancer metastasis NDP087: PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF VISFATIN PROTEIN OVEREXPRESSION IN UPPER TRACT UROTHELIAL CARCINOMAS IN TAIWAN Hung-Lung Ke , Hui-Hui Lin , Wei-Ming Li , Ching-Chia Li , Lin-Li Chang , Yi-Chen Lee , Chun-Nung Huang , WenJeng Wu .

This study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of visfatin on prognosis of patients with upper tract urothelial carcinoma. Materials andMethods: One-hundred and five patients (median age1⁄4 64, range 1⁄4 24-84 years) were included in this study. Visfatin expression in upper tract urothelial carcinoma tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Visfatin expression was correlated with clinicopathologic variables using the c2 test. The prognostic value of visfatin for recurrence-free and cance-specific survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier estimates, and the significance of differences between curves was evaluated by the logrank test. Cox regression model was also used to evaluate the hazard ratios of visfatin on survival. Results: High visfatin expression in upper tract urothelial carcinoma tissues was significantly correlated with tumor stage (p 1⁄4 0.001), grade (p 1⁄4 0.007) and p53 expression (p 1⁄4 0.07). High visfatin expression was associated with poor recurrence-free and cancer-specific survival. Cox regression analysis also revealed that visfatin is an independent predictor of recurrence-free (HR 1⁄4 3.22, p 1⁄4 0.009) and cancer-specific survival (HR 1⁄4 5.74, p 1⁄4 0.023). Conclusion: Our findings indicated that higher visfatin expression is a potential biomarker to predict patient survival. Further study is necessary to investigate the molecular mechanisms of visfatin involved in the cancerous processes of upper tract urothelial carcinoma.
