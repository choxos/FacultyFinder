  "abstract": "Psychiatrist who reinterpreted the Royal Free fatigue epidemic and wrote historical atlases Colin McEvedy was interested in mass movements of people, whether as a psychiatrist, historian, or demographer, but it was his analysis of a mystery illness at the Royal Free Hospital in London that made his name in psychiatry.In 1955 an epidemic swept through the nursing staff at the Royal Free, closing the hospital for three months.In all, 300 people were affected, 200 of whom were admitted.No one died and not one single hospital patient was affected, and no causative organism was ever found, though not for want of looking.The disease was described as a benign, myalgic form of encephalomyelitis.Fifteen years later, Colin McEvedy, then a senior registrar at the Middlesex Hospital, co-wrote two papers (with his boss, Professor Bill Beard), arguing, firstly, that the epidemic was one of conversion hysteria triggered by fear, probably of polio (BMJ 1970;1(687):7-11), which was still a serious problem at the time; and, secondly, that it was one of several reported similar epidemics, others of which were among hospital nurses (BMJ 1970;1(687):11-15).McEvedy was meanwhile writing a thesis on two epidemics of mass hysteria in girls' schools.His doctoral thesis was accepted without difficulty, but the papers on the Royal Free outbreak were greeted with howls of rage.Although he and Beard emphasised that the diagnosis of hysteria was \"not a slur on the individuals or the institution involved\" and that \"the hysterical reaction is part of everyone's potential,\" many people, it seemed, felt that while hysteria was an acceptable diagnosis in the case of schoolgirls, it was not in the case of nurses.McEvedy and Beard's argument was that, in addition to the absence of an identifiable causative organism, most people recovered unremarkably, and most biochemical tests were normal.Most sufferers had depression, fatigue, and vague neurological signs.Many had paralysis or sensory disturbances, but their reflexes were normal.Taking the institution as a wholestaff, students, and patients-the epidemic affected 10.4% of women and only 2.8% of men.Two sufferers who died from other causes (ovarian cancer, disseminated",
