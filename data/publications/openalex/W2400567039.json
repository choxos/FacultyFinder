  "abstract": "The relationship between blocking and inference in causal learning. Evan J. Livesey (evan.livesey@sydney.edu.au) Jessica C. Lee (jlee4128@uni.sydney.edu.au) Lauren T. Shone (lsho0771@uni.sydney.edu.au) School of Psychology, University of Sydney Sydney, NSW 2006 Australia Abstract The blocking effect in causal learning, once taken as a hallmark of associative learning, has recently been explained in terms of an explicit deductive reasoning process. Yet when the conditions necessary for deduction are removed, a small blocking effect is often still present. We examined the relationship between blocking and participants’ performance on analytical thinking and probabilistic reasoning measures. Inferential processes predict blocking or an absence of blocking in this situation, depending on the observer’s consideration of conditional probabilities. Although Bayesian inference predicts blocking, most individuals are not inclined to use this form of probabilistic reasoning explicitly, an observation we confirmed using a logical problem with similar properties to the relationships present in the blocking effect. Furthermore, participants who showed the greatest capacity for analytical reflection were less likely to show a blocking effect, suggesting that blocking in causal learning is the product of an intuitive and unreflective thought process. Keywords: Blocking; causal learning; inferential reasoning; associative learning; Bayesian inference. Introduction Many theories of causal learning assume that when individuals make judgments about the relationship between putative causes and their effects, some form of inferential reasoning is involved. However, theories differ substantially in how they place inferential reasoning amongst other contributing mechanisms. Some authors have argued that all causal judgments are necessarily the product of explicit inferential processes based on consciously mediated propositions about the relationships between events (Mitchell, De Houwer and Lovibond, 2009). Others assume that in making causal judgments about a cue, relatively automatic memory retrieval mechanisms based on associative learning play a much greater role, bringing to mind the events that were previously paired with that cue. According to this account, inferential thoughts of an analytical nature – for instance based on formal logic and reasoning – play a smaller role, in some cases perhaps only when strongly encouraged. Blocking in causal learning The blocking effect has become an important test bed for these arguments. In a typical blocking experiment, one cue (A) is presented and is reliably followed by a particular outcome. In a second stage, A is presented with another cue (B) and this compound of two cues is followed by the outcome. B is never presented by itself and its relationship with the outcome is thus ambiguous. When asked to give a rating of the extent to which each of a number of cues causes the outcome, participants often given a lower rating for B than for control cues (C and D) that were also presented in compound and followed by the outcome but were never presented on their own. The cues and outcomes are often presented within a hypothetical scenario. For instance, in the allergist task, the participant assumes the role of a doctor trying to determine the cause of a patient’s allergic reactions. The participant might observe that when the patient eats Fish they suffer from a reaction (A+), and later when the patient eats Fish and Rice (AB+), they suffer from the same allergic reaction. The patient might also suffer from an allergic reaction after eating Mushrooms and Pasta (CD+), but does not suffer a reaction after eating various other foods (e.g. E-). After learning to predict what will happen after certain meals, through a process of trial and error, the participant must then make an explicit judgment about the extent to which a food or foods cause the allergic reaction, or the likelihood that a reaction will occur given that certain foods have been consumed. The blocking effect is well documented in causal learning experiments using the allergist task and other similar scenarios. Its presence was originally taken as evidence that a similar associative learning process was responsible for causal learning and conditioning in humans and other animals because blocking in classical conditioning is widely replicated and well explained by associative learning theories (Dickinson, Shanks, and Evenden, 1984). Several other prominent theoretical approaches to causal reasoning also provide explanations of blocking (e.g. Cheng, 1997; Griffiths, Sobel, Tenenbaum, Gopnik, 2011; Waldmann, 2000). Whether based on associations or statistical computation, many theories of causal learning share an assumption that causal judgments partly reflect an implicit sensitivity to the contingencies between observed events. This sensitivity allows the observer to make judgments about causation with little deliberate mental effort, even when the causal relationships between cues and outcomes are ambiguous and must be inferred indirectly, as in the case of blocking (e.g. see Sternberg and McClelland, 2011). Blocking and inferential reasoning Recently, several authors have argued for an explanation of blocking that relies only on inferential reasoning based",
