  "title": "A Handbook on Diseases of Children: Including Dietetics and the Common Fevers.",
  "abstract": "This handbook has been updated in its ninth edition without much change in its traditional flavor. The style continues to be familiar and discursive. Many subjects are treated, mostly superficially. Emphasis is on clinical aspects of illness; basic pathophysiology is given scant space, and often details of treatment as well. There is meager discussion of the assessment of normal growth and development. Chromosomes are confused with sex chromatin in discussion of Klinefelter's and Turner's syndromes. The discussion of achondroplasia violates fundamental mendelian principle. Though this work reads pleasantly and gives a broad view of the subject matter of pediatrics, it will be of limited usefulness to the contemporary physician concerned in depth with childhood illness.",
