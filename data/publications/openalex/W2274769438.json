  "title": "The Life of the City: Space, Humour, and the Experience of Truth in Fin-de-Siècle Montmartre",
  "abstract": "That Montmartre at the end of the nineteenth century was a marginal but vibrant part of the ever dynamic artistic and cultural scene of Paris has been long known to historians of France. Montmartre’s legendary status has been vividly portrayed by Louis Chevalier, Charles Rearick and Roger Shattuck, among others. Much of the popular allure of the colourful district has resulted in a commercial and touristic imprint that makes la Butte an important part of any visitor’s itinerary on a first visit to Paris and the steps by Sacre Coeur as crowded as any other area of the city. Attempts to overcome the touristic imprint and to study the district seriously nonetheless continue as scholars seek to accommodate its image with the reality of the Paris Commune of 1871 and its later immersion in avant-garde culture and anarchism. Julian Brigstocke’s The Life of the City is one such attempt. Brigstocke’s approach is that of social and cultural geography, relevant to a district raised high above the rest of Paris, seemingly a separate village incorporated into the city during the mid-nineteenth century. Connecting cultural geography to the historical changes of the time is relevant and helpful. In fact, it would be difficult to envision the unfolding of events in Montmartre without understanding its unique geographical relationship to the rest of the city.",
