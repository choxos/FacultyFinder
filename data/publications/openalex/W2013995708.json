Otoscopic examination and estimates of the cost to accurately detect hearing loss were used as criteria for comparing the two methods. The impedance technique detected 94% of hearing disorders, the audiometric, 24%. Projections of cost included a factor for number screened. These demonstrated that the impedance technique was less expensive and approached one-sixth the cost of the audiometric technique at a rate of 10,000 children per year. A routine application of the impedance technique in an ongoing hearing conservation program (N = 2712) supported the initial conclusion that it was more effective and more easily employable than audiometric screening. One child who passed impedance screening was shown to have a 50-dB sensorineural loss. It was concluded that an abbreviated form of impedance audiometry that includes a single high-frequency screening tone is the technique of choice for school screening.
