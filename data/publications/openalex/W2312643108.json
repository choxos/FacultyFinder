D'Império Lima1 1 Universidade de São Paulo, Brazil 2 MRC National Institute for Medical Research, United Kingdom 3 University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom 4 Vrije Universiteit Medical Center, Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Netherlands 5 Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, Portugal During experimental malaria, several changes in structure and cell numbers occur in spleen. The effects of these modifications on phagocytosis by spleen dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophage subsets are so far unknown, and the relative importance of this activity is not well understood. By using different in vivo and ex vivo approaches, we described some aspects of parasite phagocytosis and the implications to immune responses to infection. In naïve mice, DCs and F4/80+ red pulp macrophages (RpMOs) promptly recognized and internalized parasites, and enhanced the ability of making stable contacts with T and B cells inside spleen, respectively. The importance of DCs and RpMOs to activation of respectively T and B cells, as well as for survival after infection, was confirmed by depletion strategies. During the parasitemia peak, migrating inflammatory monocytes (MMs) were also able to phagocytize parasites, thus helping the parasitemia elimination observed in this model. However, these MMs were also crucial for controlling excessive CD4+ T cell activation by production of nitric oxide (NO); this control was necessary for full CD4+ T cell memory responses to parasite challenge. Thus, DCs, RpMOs and MMs contribute in distinct ways for parasite elimination and the induction of a massive, yet controlled, immune response to blood stage malaria.
