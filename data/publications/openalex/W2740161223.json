  "title": "Leader perceptions and motivation as outcomes of followership role orientation and behavior",
  "abstract": "Followership research posits that followers differ in the way they define and enact the followership role, which can have varying effects in relation to how leaders experience their own roles and responsibilities. Drawing from the role orientation literature and newly emerging research on followership, our study examines the indirect effects of followers’ co-production (co-producing leadership outcomes) and passive (deferring to leadership influence) role orientations on leader-rated outcomes of perceived follower support, leader motivation, and follower contribution to goal attainment via followers’ voice and upward delegation behaviors. Using data from 306 dyads in a Chinese organization, our results show that follower voice and upward delegation mediate the relationships linking followers’ co-production and passive role orientations with leader-rated outcomes. Our study provides evidence that followership role orientations and behaviors differentially influence leader perceptions regarding their followers’ support, contribution to goal attainment, and leader motivation. Implications are drawn for further research on followership and the importance of considering leader outcomes as critical variables in leadership and followership literatures.",
