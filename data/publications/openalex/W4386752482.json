  "title": "The Interplay Between the Motivational Drives of Autonomy and Competence on Declarative Memory",
  "abstract": "Autonomy and competence are extensively studied concepts known to impact intrinsic motivation. However, their effect on memorization and the interaction between these factors during learning remains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the interplay between autonomy and competence in relation to declarative memory within a well-controlled experimental learning environment. Two experiments were conducted in which participants removed an occluding screen to reveal an object they had to memorize. Experiment 1 introduced a novel manipulation of competence through task difficulty, and its effect on declarative memory of the objects was assessed. Results indicated that perceived competence decreased as task difficulty increased, demonstrating that the manipulation was successful. Additionally, the findings demonstrated a positive impact of task difficulty on memory performance. Building upon these findings, Experiment 2 specifically examined the interaction between autonomy and competence on declarative memory. The results revealed an interaction effect between autonomy and competence on declarative memory, with autonomy enhancing memory performance only when competence was high. Collectively, these findings demonstrate a complex, yet meaningful, interaction between autonomy and competence, underscoring the need to consider both elements in educational and learning settings.",
