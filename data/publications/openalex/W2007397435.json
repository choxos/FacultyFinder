  "abstract": "On the basis of a theoretical model developed by Fishbein it was predicted that an individuals intention to engage in a specific family planning behavior is a function of 2 components: ones beliefs regarding the consequences of performing that behavior multiplied by the evaluation of those consequences; and ones normative beliefs multiplied by ones motivation to comply with those perceived notions. The study subjects consisted of a stratified random sample of 270 women residing in Urbana-Champaign Illinois. These currently married white women ranging in age from 18-38 years were stratified in terms of 3 levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and 2 levels of religious affiliation (Catholic and Protestant). Subjects were administered a questionnaire assessing the models components for 3 family planning behaviors--having a 2 child family having a child during the next 2 years and using oral contraceptives. For the total sample the model provided highly accurate prediction of family planning intentions. The high multiple correlations of the models components with behavioral intention (BI) observed within each of the major subsamples indicated that for the prediction of family planning intentions the model is most likely generalizable to the majority of the American population. The models predictability was unaffected by such factors as SES level of education or religion. As predicted by Fishbeins model there was evidence that an individuals attitude toward performing each of the 3 behaviors was highly correlated with the beliefs about the consequences of performing the behavior and the evaluations of these consequences. The superiority of specific attitude measures in predicting BI was demonstrated in the data. In sum the investigation indicated that fertility-related intentions may be understood in terms of the theoretical model of BI.",
