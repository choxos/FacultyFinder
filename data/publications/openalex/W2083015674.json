  "title": "Influence of teacher preparation programmes on preservice teachers’ attitudes toward inclusion",
  "abstract": "Abstract With the increased implementation of inclusive education, teacher educators have been challenged to make changes in programmes to prepare preservice teachers to educate diverse learners. These changes are reflected in various types of teacher preparation programmes that are transformations of traditional general education and special education programmes. However, little is known about the ways in which these transformed teacher preparation programmes influence preservice teachers’ attitudes toward inclusive education as future inclusive educators. To investigate the influence of teacher preparation programmes on preservice teachers’ attitudes toward inclusion, a survey method was used to collect data from preservice teachers in ten teacher preparation programmes. The responses from 110 preservice teachers were analysed according to the type of teacher preparation programme (i.e. combined, separate, or general teacher preparation programmes). The results indicated that preservice teachers from combined teacher preparation programmes in which general education and special education teacher preparation curricula were infused had significantly more positive attitudes toward inclusion than preservice teachers from separate programmes (p < 0.05). The implications of this study for practice and future research are discussed. Keywords: wordinclusionpreservice teachersattitudes",
