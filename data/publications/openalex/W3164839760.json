  "title": "Should we use the transradial approach in cardiogenic shock?",
  "abstract": "Transradial approach in cardiogenic shock 409 flow after PCI was more frequently observed in the TRA group; however, angiographic core laboratory validation was not performed.Overall, reported bleeding rates were very low.Although recent studies of TRA as compared with TFA did not demonstrate a significant difference in treatment delays, there were previous concerns that TRA might prolong door -to -balloon times. 10,11Reassuringly, in this study, there was no difference in delays between symptoms onset and first medical contact or coronary angiography between the groups.This analysis of TFA as compared with TRA in CS is nonrandomized and so is only hypothesis--generating.It is likely that residual confounding does exist despite propensity matching given the absolute difference in mortality.Patients and centers that used TRA in CS are likely different than those that used TFA.However, randomized trials of TRA as compared with TFA access in CS are unlikely to be performed given the body of evidence supporting TRA outside of CS.Another important finding from this study is that high -volume operators have better outcomes in patients with acute myocardial infarction and CS particularly with TRA than lower volume operators.In conclusion, these data support safety and feasibility of TRA in patients in CS, who often do not have a palpable radial artery.Given the wealth of data, a radial -first approach should be considered in CS.",
