  "title": "P3‐407: Patients’ and caregivers’ willingness to pay for a new Alzheimer's disease medication",
  "abstract": "Many Canadians pay ‘out-of-pocket’ for Alzheimer's disease (AD) medications. We investigated whether and to what extent Canadian patients with mild to moderate AD and their primary caregivers would be willing to pay out-of-pocket for a new AD medication. We recruited 96 patient-caregiver dyads from nine clinics across Canada and collected data via one-on-one personal interviews. Participants were presented with four scenarios describing a hypothetical, new AD medication. Two scenarios described the medication as treating the symptoms of cognitive decline; two other scenarios described the medication as halting disease progression. For each pair of ‘efficacy’ scenarios, the medication was assumed to have no adverse effects in one scenario and a 30% chance of primarily gastrointestinal adverse effects in the other scenario. In each scenario, interviewers asked participants whether they would pay out-of-pocket for the new medication. Participants who responded affirmatively provided the maximum Canadian dollar amount they would be willing to pay per month. We assessed willingness to pay using a combination of bid ranges and open-ended questions; we randomized participants to order of scenarios and bids. Median ages were 81 years (patients) and 70.5 years (caregivers); 43 patients and 69 caregivers were female. Median self-reported health state on the EQ-5D VAS (0=worst state; 100=best state) was 80 for patients and caregivers alike. Overall, 63-77% of patients and 66-88% of caregivers reported they would pay out-of-pocket for the AD medication, depending on scenario. Patient and caregiver support was highest for the symptom treatment and no adverse effects scenario. Average maximum willingness to pay per month ranged from $198-219 for patients and $289-331 for caregivers, depending on scenario. Both groups’ highest average maximum willingness to pay was for the disease modifying and no adverse effects scenario. Most participants supported paying out-of-pocket for the AD medication. For each scenario, greater proportions of caregivers supported out-of-pocket payment relative to patients. Also, regardless of scenario, caregivers’ average maximum willingness to pay exceeded patients’ average maximum willingness to pay.",
