This self-directed resource serves as a supplement to traditional lecture and clinical teaching. The purpose of the module is to help students develop a clinical approach to the evaluation and initial management of patients presenting with suspicious growths, particularly basal cell carcinoma. In this case, a 62-year-old gentleman presents with a facial growth. As students navigate through the module, they are presented with various decision branch points in the care of this patient. Based on their decisions, students follow a variety of sequences. In this way, the module more closely mimics a true clinical experience as students are able to see the consequences of their clinical decision-making. A brief summary of key points on the clinical topic (including epidemiology, etiology, treatment, and prognosis) can be reviewed at the end of the module. The module requires compatibility with PowerPoint 2007 or Microsoft Office 2007. A recent study found that computer-assisted instruction is at least as effective as traditional lecture in teaching dermatology morphology to medical students. The effectiveness and significance of the present work have yet to be determined. We plan to use online pre- and postassessments to evaluate the effectiveness of this module. Educational Objectives By the end of this module, learners will be able to: Develop a practical clinical approach to patients presenting with a suspicious growth.Describe morphologic features of suspicious growths.Formulate a differential diagnosis based on history and physical findings.Examine the histopathology of skin biopsy specimens.Initiate appropriate workup and initial treatment for suspicious growths.
