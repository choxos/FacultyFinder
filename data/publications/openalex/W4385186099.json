  "title": "Building coping skills to relieve distress and physical symptoms: Findings from a quality improvement project of a five-week group psychoeducational program for cancer patients",
  "abstract": "AbstractAbstractPurpose/objective: To examine the effectiveness of Mind Over Matter (MOM), a group psychosocial intervention based on CBT, ACT, and mind-body interventions, from data collected during a quality improvement project. MOM was offered in person prior to COVID-19 and via telehealth after COVID-19 began.Design/research approach: Distress, as measured by anxiety, depression, the severity of physical symptoms and the impact of physical symptoms on daily functioning, was measured pre- and post-MOM.Sample: The sample included 46 participants with an experience of cancer ranging in age from 31 to 75.Findings: Overall, there were significant differences in anxiety, depression, and physical symptom severity and interference pre and post MOM. The in-person intervention showed significant differences in anxiety, depression, and physical symptom interference. There were significant differences in anxiety and physical symptom severity reported in the telehealth groups.Implications: MOM may be an effective psychosocial intervention for addressing cancer-related physical and emotional challenges making it a valuable resource for institutions trying to meet needs identified by distress screenings.Keywords: Cancerdistressphysical symptomspsychosocial interventiontelemedicine AcknowledgementsWe thank the Inova LWC oncology social workers who facilitated the interventions.
