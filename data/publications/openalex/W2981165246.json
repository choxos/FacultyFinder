  "abstract": "AOR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.59-0.79;P < .001),Asian American race (AOR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.35-0.61;P < .001),Hispanic ethnicity (AOR, 0.56; 95% 0.48-0.65;P < .001),no insurance (AOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.47-0.80;P < .001),and no health care visit (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53-0.81;P < .001).Variables associated with increased odds of surgery included maternal education beyond high school (AOR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.04-1.50;P = .02),North Central/Midwest region (AOR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.14-1.58;P < 001), Southern region (AOR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14-1.55;P < .001),low birth weight (AOR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.35-1.88;P < .001),trisomy 21 (AOR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.58-8.65;P = .003),and congenital heart disease (AOR, 4.37; 95% CI, 2.37-8.06;P < .001).Discussion | Using a large, nationally representative crosssectional survey, we observed a decline in odds of surgery from 1998 to 2017 that was most significant in children younger than 1 year.We controlled for demographic variables and clinical factors expected to impact surgical exposure.While surgical techniques have continually evolved, we are unaware of drastic changes in surgical management for infants during this period.Our findings support the hypothesis that alternative factors including parental and practitioner concerns about anesthetic exposure may have affected surgical decision-making in infants.Interestingly, while maternal education may improve awareness of anesthesia risk, this was associated with increased odds of surgery.This study was limited by lack of data on procedure type, anesthetic details, associated outcomes, and inability to control for all confounders.We therefore recommend further prospective studies assessing these trends and associated health outcomes. Conclusions |The period prevalence and adjusted odds of surgery declined significantly from 1997 through 2017 for children younger than 1 year.",
