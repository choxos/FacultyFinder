  "title": "Abstract P1-17-03: H3B-6545 in combination with palbociclib in women with metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer, phase 1b study",
  "abstract": "Abstract Background: H3B-6545, a novel Selective ERα Covalent Antagonist (SERCA), inactivates both mutant and wild-type ERα by targeting cysteine 530 and enforcing antagonist conformation. It demonstrated a manageable safety profile and single-agent antitumor activity in heavily pretreated ER+, HER2- mBC patients (pts) (Hamilton et al, ASCO, 2021). Methods: The study aims at determining the recommended phase II doses of the combination of H3B-6545 and palbociclib in pts with ER+, HER2- mBC. Other endpoints include safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy. The escalation phase enrolls pts with at least 2 prior therapies in the metastatic setting. Up to one prior chemotherapy and up to one prior CDK4/6 inhibitor are allowed. Each cohort enrolled 6 pts to ensure availability of sufficient PK data. During the first cycle, H3B-6545 was added to palbociclib on day 9. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were assessed during the first 28 days starting from the 1st day of adding H3B-6545 to palbociclib (cycle 1 day 9 to cycle 2 day 8). Both drugs were started on day 1 of each of the subsequent cycles. Results: As of June 15, 2021, 14 pts were enrolled: 7 in Cohort 1 (H3B-6545 300 mg QD and palbociclib 100 mg QD) and 7 in Cohort 2 (H3B-6545 300 mg QD and palbociclib 125 mg QD). Median age was 61 years (range: 28-75 years), ECOG performance status was 0 in 7 pts (50%) and 1 in 7 pts (50%) and 9 pts (64%) had lung and/or liver metastases. Median number of prior therapies in the metastatic setting was 3 (range: 1-6). Prior therapy in the metastatic setting included fulvestrant (93%), CDK4/6 inhibitors (79%), aromatase inhibitors (64%), and chemotherapy (29%). One pt in each Cohort was not evaluable for dose limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment and no DLTs were observed in the first 2 Cohorts. Seven pts discontinued study treatment because of progression and 1 pt discontinued due to diagnosis of a second primary cancer during the first cycle. Non-hematological grade 2 or higher adverse events (AE), irrespective of causality, reported in ≥2 pts were: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and bone pain, each observed in 2 pts (14%). Gr. 1 and 2 sinus bradycardia were reported in 6 (43%) and 1 pts (7%), respectively. One pt (7%) had grade 1 QT prolongation. No grade 4 AEs or treatment-related deaths were reported. For hematology and chemistry laboratory abnormalities: gr. 3 and 4 neutropenia in 7 pts (50%) and 2 pts (14%), respectively, gr. 3 thrombocytopenia in 1 pt (7%), gr. 3 anemia in 2 pts (14%). Grade 2 decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate was observed in 7 pts (50%), all reported irrespective of causality. Co-administration of palbociclib had no meaningful impact on H3B-6545 exposure (15% and 21% increase in geometric means of AUC and Cmax, respectively). Co-administration of H3B-6545 modestly increased palbociclib exposure (49% and 36% increase in geometric means of AUC and Cmax, respectively). Among 6 response-evaluable pts in Cohort 1, 2 pts (33%) had confirmed partial responses and 4 pts (67%) had stable disease. Both responding pts received prior therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and fulvestrant. Cohort 2 efficacy data is not yet mature. Recruitment is currently ongoing in Cohort 3 (H3B-6545 450 mg QD and palbociclib 125 mg QD). Conclusions: The combination of H3B-6545 (up to 300 mg dose) and palbociclib (up to 125 mg dose) was well-tolerated and demonstrated preliminary anti-tumor activity in heavily pretreated pts with ER+, HER2- mBC.
