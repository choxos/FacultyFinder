  "title": "Influence of masticatory fatigue on the fracture resistance of the pulpless teeth restored with quartz-fiber post–core and crown",
  "abstract": "To investigate whether masticatory fatigue affects the fracture resistance and pattern of lower premolars restored with quartz-fiber post–core and full crown, 44 single rooted lower premolars recently extracted from orthodontic patients were divided into two groups of 22 each. The crowns of all teeth were removed and endodontically treated and then restored with quartz-fiber post–core and full crown. Twenty-two teeth in one group were selected randomly and circularly loaded at 45° to the long axis of the teeth of 127.4 N at a 6 Hz frequency, and the other group was not delivered to cyclic loading and considered as control. Subsequently, all teeth in two groups were continually loaded to fail at 45° to the long axis of the teeth at a crosshead speed of 1 mm⋅min−1. The mean destructive force values were (733.88±254.99) and (869.14±280.26) N for the experimental and the control group, respectively, and no statistically significant differences were found between two groups (P>0.05). Bevel fracture and horizontal fracture in the neck of root were the major fracture mode of the specimens. Under the circumstances of this study, it seems that cyclic loading does not affect the fracture strength and pattern of the quartz-fiber post–core–crown complex. Daily chewing has no effect on the fracture toughness of quartz-fiber tooth restoration materials, according to recent research from China. Chun-Yuan Zhang from Sun Yat-Sen University and colleagues investigated how extracted molars — that had been repaired with aligned quartz-fiber 'posts' in an epoxy matrix — behave under two kinds of destructive force. They found that molars subjected to five years' worth of chewing motions through cyclic force loading had identical fracture points and patterns as molars under a static, steadily increasing force. Zhang and colleagues attribute the resilience of the quartz posts to biomechanical movements that allow homogenous transfer of stress into tooth dentin. Chemically enhanced bonding of the quartz posts to teeth and structural reinforcements also contributed to the sturdiness of this novel system.",
