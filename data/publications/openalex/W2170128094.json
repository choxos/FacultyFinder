A new ball-tip holmium laser fiber (Flexiva TracTip - Boston Scientific) was designed to atraumatically pass through a deflected ureteroscope. We evaluated the stone comminution capabilities and tip degradation of this fiber in an in vitro model. METHODS A 200 μm ball-tip (BT) fiber and standard fiber (SF) (Flexiva - Boston Scientific) were compared by delivering energy to a Begostone over a constant surface area controlled by a stage controller and 3 dimensional positioning system. Laser settings were 0.2J/50Hz, 0.6J/6Hz, 0.8J/8Hz, and 1J/10Hz. Fiber tip degradation was measured at 1 kJ and 4 kJ of delivered energy. Fiber-stone contact was adjusted every 1 kJ to account for any loss in length. Comminution efficiency was determined by measuring stone weight loss following lithotripsy at each energy setting. ANOVA or Kruskal Wallace test was used for multiple groups, and post hoc tests with Bonferroni correction were then applied (t-test, Wilcoxon). RESULTS A total of 5 virgin fibers were used to test each condition. Tip degradation by 1 kJ with all energy settings and 4 kJ at 0.2J/50Hz was minimal for both fibers without significant differences. By 4 kJ, tip degradation was less overall for the BT and maximal for the SF at 1J/10Hz (Table). Comminution was found to increase with pulse energy for both BT and SF fibers up to the 0.8J/8Hz setting (p < 0.003). No significant differences were found between 0.8J/8Hz and 1J/10Hz or between BT and SF fibers at any energy setting (Figure). CONCLUSIONS The ball-tip fiber exhibits similar comminution efficiency to a standard holmium laser fiber with minimal tip degradation at clinically relevant laser settings in our in vitro model. The new tip design may provide an advantage in access maneuverability without loss of performance. Further in vivo studies are warranted to validate these objective findings.
