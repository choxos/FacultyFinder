  "title": "Efficacy of Clinically Used Anthelmintics Against Toxocariasis of Buffalo Calves in Bangladesh",
  "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Toxocariasis is a paramount parasitic disease having over 50% prevalence among newborn buffalo calves in Bangladesh. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of clinically used anthelmintics and their subsequent effects on the hematological parameters and body weight in buffalo calves in commercial buffalo farms in coastal region. Thirty-two buffalo calves below 3 months of age with clinical <italic>Toxocara</italic> infection had been selected and treated with albendazole (ABZ), levamisole (LVM) and ivermectin (IVM). The EPG counts, hematological parameters and initial body weight of buffalo calves were recorded on the day of anthelmintic treatment (day 0). Fecal samples were collected on day 14 and 28 including hematological parameters and body weight were recorded on day 28 post-treatment. The efficacy (%) of anthelmintics were estimated by fecal egg count reduction test (FECRT). The parameters like Hb, PCV, ESR, TEC, TLC were analyzed from the blood samples. The FECRT revealed 96.83% efficacy for IVM followed by 94.23% and 85.84% for LVM and ABZ, respectively. Anthelmintic treated calves showed significant (p&lt;0.01) increase in Hb, PCV, TEC and body weight, and decrease in ESR and TLC as a result of worm expulsion from buffalo calves after 28 days of post-treatment. Among the tested anthelmintics, IVM was found to be more effective against toxocariasis in buffalo calves. This is a novel new information on anthelmintics efficacy in buffalo calves in Bangladesh. Further studies are imperative to explore the factors responsible for high prevalence of this deadly nematode in buffalo calves.",
