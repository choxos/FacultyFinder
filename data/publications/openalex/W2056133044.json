  "title": "People Like Us: Memories of Marginality in High School and University",
  "abstract": "Written from the site of memory, this autobiographical tale represents some of the authorâ€™s experiences with racism, classism, homophobia, and death in Canada during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Also discussed are his later and ongoing use of the language of sociology to interpret these experiences and his re-reinvention of self using elements of the popular culture of the era. It is not intended as a sad tale or a survival tale, although it could be read as either. Instead, it is to be regarded as a tale told by a member of a population of unknown but possibly large size.",
