  "title": "Anticancer effect of ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside in chemically induced hepatocellular carcinoma.",
  "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of death in cancer and yet no drug has proven to be a successful candidate for its treatment in advanced stages. Ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside (UASG) is a newly discovered triterpene in Lantana camara and there lies a possibility that it possess anti-hepatocellular carcinoma property. In the present study, we induced hepatocellular carcinoma in Wistar rats by diethylnitrosamine (DENA) and treated it with ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside. The ability to treat hepatocellular carcinoma was measured by comparing biochemical serum markers such as serum alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum alkaline phosphatase, and the specific marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, alpha fetoprotein. The histological studies of the livers were also performed. The results have shown significant elevated levels of these parameters as compared to normal control and the drug receiving groups have shown significant reduction in these marker levels. Histopathological studies also indicated the reduced liver damage in drug-treated groups. It was noted that a significant and dose-dependent reversal of DENA-diminished activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and the reduced DENA-elevated level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) with a marked change. UASG significantly suppressed free radical formation by scavenging the hydroxyl radicals. It also modulates the levels of LPO and markedly increases the endogenous antioxidant enzymes level in DENA-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis.",
