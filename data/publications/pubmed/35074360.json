  "title": "Prevention of Osteoporotic Fractures in Residential Aged Care: Updated Consensus Recommendations.",
  "abstract": "Osteoporosis is underdiagnosed and undertreated in people living in Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs), even though aged-care residents are at greater risk of experiencing fractures than their community-dwelling counterparts. The first (2009) and second (2016) Consensus Conferences on the Treatment of Osteoporosis in RACFs in Australia addressed the prevention of falls and fractures in RACFs. A third Consensus Conference was held to review advances in the field of osteoporosis for people living in RACFs and to update current guidelines. The Conference was held virtually in October 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Attendance at the meeting was open to health practitioners (n = 116) (eg, general practitioners, geriatricians, rehabilitation specialists, endocrinologists, pharmacists, and physiotherapists) working in RACFs. Participants chose and/or were assigned to breakout groups to review the evidence and reach a consensus on the topic area assigned to the group, which was then presented to the entire group by a nominated spokesperson. Recommendations developed by breakout groups were discussed and voted on by all attending participants. This article updates the evidence for preventing falls and fractures and managing osteoporosis in older adults living in RACFs based on agreed outcomes from the group. We anticipate these updated recommendations will provide health practitioners with valuable guidance when practicing in RACFs.",
