  "title": "VI-VS: calibrated identification of feature dependencies in single-cell multiomics.",
  "abstract": "Unveiling functional relationships between various molecular cell phenotypes from data using machine learning models is a key promise of multiomics. Existing methods either use flexible but hard-to-interpret models or simpler, misspecified models. VI-VS (Variational Inference for Variable Selection) balances flexibility and interpretability to identify relevant feature relationships in multiomic data. It uses deep generative models to identify conditionally dependent features, with false discovery rate control. VI-VS is available as an open-source Python package, providing a robust solution to identify features more likely representing genuine causal relationships.",
