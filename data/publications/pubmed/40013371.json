  "title": "Exploring the therapeutic promise of fisetin: molecular mechanisms and clinical aspects in lung cancer.",
  "abstract": "Fisetin, a flavonol belonging to the flavonoid subclass, is a ubiquitous dietary flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables, including fruit peels, and has proven potential for anticancer activity, especially for lung cancer - a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The current paper provides the most detailed and elaborate list of the various roles of fisetin in experimentally induced lung cancer cells, and these roles include the promotion of apoptosis, inhibition of cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the regulation of autophagy. Among the molecular targets, some identified pathways, such as PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-ÎºB, that fisetin affects are crucial for tumor formation, so it can be considered a potential chemopreventive agent. Moreover, fisetin improves the effectiveness of conventional treatments as a chemo- and radiosensitizer and minimizes side effects. However, the overall utility of fisetin for clinical use is now somewhat restricted by its poor solubility and short half-life. It is predicted that the future development of nanotechnologies for drug delivery, such as nanoparticle encapsulation, might help solve these difficulties. Further Preclinical and clinical investigations are required to uniformly determine the safety, efficacy, and standard dosage of fisetin for consumption in lung cancer therapy.",
