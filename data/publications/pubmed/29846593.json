  "abstract": "Clinical trials require valid outcome measures to assess the therapeutic benefit of investigational agents. Recently, regulatory authorities have mandated the use of patient-reported outcomes in combination with an objective measure of disease activity as primary outcome measures in inflammatory bowel disease trials. Endoscopy has commonly fulfilled the latter role; however, due to the costs and complexity of these assessments, interest has emerged in the use of noninvasive biomarkers. The role of C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, and fecal lactoferrin in clinical research is discussed.",
