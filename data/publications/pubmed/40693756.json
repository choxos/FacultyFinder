  "abstract": "Factors associated with COVID-19 mortality are not well characterized in children. This Canadian-Caribbean case-control study identified 26 children who died of COVID-19 and matched them to 78 children hospitalized with COVID-19 who survived. Medical technology dependence and several comorbidities were associated with death which occurred in 0.7% of COVID-19 admissions.",
