  "title": "Temporal trends in severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic disease: a cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues worldwide, severe COVID-19 outcomes remain a major concern for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases. We aimed to investigate temporal trends in COVID-19 outcomes in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases over the course of the pandemic. METHODS: Using a large, multicentre, electronic health record network (TriNetX), we did a comparative cohort study of patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 (by International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision code or positive PCR test) during the first 90 days of the pandemic (early cohort) compared with the second 90 days of the pandemic (late cohort), matched (1:1) for demographics, comorbidities, laboratory results, glucocorticoid use, and previous hospitalisations using an exposure score method. Outcomes were assessed within 30 days of COVID-19 diagnosis, including hospitalisation, intensive care unit admission, invasive mechanical ventilation, renal failure, and death. We did a subgroup analysis among patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were hospitalised with COVID-19. FINDINGS: We identified 8540 patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the 6-month study period, including 2811 in the early cohort and 5729 in the late cohort. In the exposure score matched analysis, the risk of hospitalisation was lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (874 [32·4%] of 2701 patients vs 1227 [45·4%] of 2701 patients; relative risk [RR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·67-0·76). The risks of intensive care unit admission (214 [7·9%] vs 385 [14·3%]; RR 0·56, 95% CI 0·47-0·65), mechanical ventilation (96 [3·6%] vs 247 [9·1%]; 0·39, 0·31-0·49), acute kidney injury (372 [13·8%] vs 560 [20·7%]; 0·66, 0·59-0·75), renal replacement therapy (17 [0·6%] vs 32 [1·2%]; 0·53, 0·30-0·96), and death (122 [4·5%] vs 252 [9·3%]; 0·48, 0·39-0·60) were lower in the late cohort compared with the early cohort. Among the hospitalised subgroup, the risk of the composite outcome of intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation, and death was lower in the late cohort than in the early cohort (334 [30·7%] of 1089 patients vs 450 [41·3%] of 1089 patients; RR 0·74, 95% CI 0·67-0·83). INTERPRETATION: The risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes have improved over time in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease but remain substantial. These findings might reflect ascertainment of milder cases in the later cohort and improvements in treatment and supportive care. FUNDING: None.",
