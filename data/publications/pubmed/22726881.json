  "title": "Mortality inequalities by environment type in New Zealand.",
  "abstract": "In previous work a multivariate measure of health-related physical environment - the Multiple Environmental Deprivation Classification (MEDClass) - was created to investigate relationships between exposure to differing types of physical environment and health for the UK. Associations between MEDClass and all cause mortality, mortality from certain specific causes, and self-reported morbidity, independent of the level of socio-economic deprivation, were found. In this short report we determine whether the MEDClass approach has potential for international replication and whether the relationships with health prevails. We use New Zealand as a case study. Six environmental clusters were identified and similar associations between environmental classification and health outcomes were observed. Whilst this report shows that the framework used to create MEDClass can be transferred to an international context, we are reminded of the need to engage locally with place based research upon which an evidence base of cumulative impacts of the environment can be built.",
