  "abstract": "Reduction of right ventricular (RV) function after cardiac surgery has been shown to impact outcomes. Conventional indices for right ventricular dysfunction are validated using transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) which has limited use compared to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) in the perioperative settings. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement of RV systolic function assessment with TEE compared to TTE and assess the association of echocardiographic parameter with hemodynamic indices of RV dysfunction. This was a single center prospective observational study in an academic institution. Fifty adult patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were included. TTE, TEE and stroke volume measurements pre-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and post-CPB were performed. The variables of interest were anatomical M-mode tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (AMM-TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC), tricuspid annular velocity (S') and myocardial performance index (MPI). FAC and AMM-TAPSE measured at the mid-esophageal 4 chamber view had substantial agreement with the TTE acquired parameters (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) = 0.76, 95%CI 0.59-0.86 and CCC = 0.85, 95%CI 0.76-0.91). S' was significantly underestimated by TEE (CCC = 0.07, 95%CI 0.04-0.19) and MPI showed moderate agreement (CCC = 0.45 95%CI 0.19-0.65). Despite the significant changes in echocardiographic parameters, there were no corresponding changes in stroke volume (SV) or pulmonary artery pulsatility index at the post-CPB period. TEE acquired FAC and AMM-TAPSE had substantial agreement with pre-operative TTE values and no significant differences between the pre-CPB and post-CPB period. Systolic RV echocardiographic parameters decreased post-CPB but this was not accompanied by significant hemodynamic changes.",
