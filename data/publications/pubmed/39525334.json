  "title": "Effect of Prehospital Digital Electrocardiogram Transmission on Revascularization Delays and Mortality in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prehospital transmission of the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to the interventional cardiologist has become the standard of care in many ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) networks but has not been adopted universally. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assess the effect of prehospital digital ECG transmission in STEMI patients on door-to-device times, first medical contact-to-device times, and mortality. METHODS: We performed a systematic review of all English-language studies in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL (from inception to July 24, 2023), comparing the effect of prehospital digital ECG transmission to that of no ECG transmission in STEMI patients. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: We included 17 observational studies totalling 4306 patients. Door-to-device times were reduced by 33.3 minutes in patients with prehospital digital ECG transmission (95% confidence intervals [CIs] -50.5, -16.2 minutes; P < 0.001; I[2] 99%). First-medical-contact-to-device time also was reduced with prehospital digital ECG transmission (mean difference, -24.7 minutes; 95% CI -37.1, -12.3 minutes; P < 0.001; I[2] 96%). Prehospital digital ECG transmissions was associated with a 47% reduction in mortality compared to no prehospital digital ECG transmission (117 of 1322 (8.9%) vs 181 of 1322 (13.7%), odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.40, 0.69; P < 0.001; I[2] = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECG transmission in STEMI patients, coupled with a systems of care reduced door-to-device times, first-medical-contact-to-device times, and mortality. STEMI networks should consider these findings to advocate for prehospital ECG transmission within their systems of care. STUDY REGISTRATION: CRD42024509271 (PROSPERO).",
