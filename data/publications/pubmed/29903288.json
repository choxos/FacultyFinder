  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dietary exposure level and health risk of antimony of children and adolescent in Hunan Province. METHODS: The content of antimony of main food were determined. The dietary exposure of children and adolescent from Hunan was calculated according to the weight and intake from Survey Report on Nutrition and Health Status of Chinese Residents Part 10: Nutrition and Health Data in2002 and combing the data of average and the 95% percentile of antimony. The health risk was evaluated compared with ADI. RESULTS: The average exposure of the population on antimony in 3 age groups were 1. 01-1. 30, 0. 85-1. 04 and 0. 83-0. 98 μg/kg BW, which exceeded the limitation of ADI(0. 86μg/kg BW) from WHO. The average exposure of antimony decreased with age, there were significant differences in antimonyexposure between the five age groups(F = 30. 597, P < 0. 05). There was no significant differences between the same age among male and female(F = 0. 155, P > 0. 05). In medium and small-sized cities, the exposure of antimony to juveniles was slightly higher than that of three type village but non-significant(F = 0. 111, P > 0. 05) was discovered. The top three income of antimony was light-color vegetables(52. 1%-61. 6%), dark vegetables(21. 1%-24. 0%) and grain(6. 0%-9. 9%). CONCLUSION: Antimony intake from food by young Children is higher than TDI, while there may be health risks.",
