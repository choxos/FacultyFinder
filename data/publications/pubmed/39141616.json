  "title": "A comparison of the characteristics of accidental substance-related acute toxicity deaths in Canada across life stages, 2016-2017.",
  "abstract": "The acute toxicity (sometimes called \"overdose\" or \"poisoning\") crisis has affected Canadians across all stages of life, including youth, adults and older adults. Our biological risks and exposures to substances change as we age. Based on a national chart review study of coroner and medical examiner data on acute toxicity deaths in 2016 and 2017, this analysis compares the burden of deaths and circumstances of death, locations of acute toxicity event and death, health history and substances contributing to death of people, by sex and life stage.",
