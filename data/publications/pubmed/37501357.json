  "abstract": "Contamination of aquatic ecosystems with organic and inorganic contaminants is a global threat due to their hazardous effects on the environment and human health. Floating treatment wetland (FTW) technology is a cost-effective and sustainable alternative to existing treatment approaches. It consists of a buoyant mat in which wetland plants can grow and develop their roots in a suspended manner and can be implemented to treat stormwater, municipal wastewater, and industrial effluents. Here we explored the potential of bacterial-augmented FTWs for the concurrent remediation of phenol and hexavalent chromium (Cr[6+]) contaminated water and evaluated treated water toxicity using Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) as a test plant. The FTWs carrying Phragmites australis L. (common reed) were inoculated with a consortium of four bacterial strains (Burkholderia phytofirmans PsJN, Acinetobacter lwofii ACRH76, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PJRS20, Bacillus sp. PJRS25) and evaluated for their potential to simultaneously remove phenol and chromium (Cr) from contaminated water. Results revealed that the FTWs efficiently improved water quality by removing phenol (86%) and Cr (80%), with combined use of P. australis and bacterial consortium after 50 days. The phytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the germination of wheat seed (96%) was significantly higher where bacterial-augmented FTWs treated water was used compared to untreated water. This pilot-scale study highlights that the combined application of wetland plants and bacterial consortium in FTWs is a promising approach for concomitant abatement of phenol and Cr from contaminated water, especially for developing countries like Pakistan where the application of advanced and expensive technologies is limited.",
