  "title": "Intraperitoneal Calcitriol for Treatment of Severe Hyperparathyroidism in Children with Chronic Kidney Disease: A Therapy Forgotten.",
  "abstract": "Active Vitamin D sterols such as calcitriol and alfacalcidol are quite effective in the treatment of mineral bone disease secondary to chronic kidney disease. However, some children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) are resistant to oral formulations of active Vitamin D, and use of an intravenous formulation in such patients is inconvenient. In these children, intraperitoneal (IP) calcitriol has been shown to be effective in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. However, its use has declined. We report 2 children, aged 1 and 9.5 years, on chronic cycler PD with severe secondary hyperparathyroidism refractory to oral active Vitamin D who were successfully treated with IP calcitriol for a period of 12 and 4 months, respectively. We also discuss the published literature on the efficacy of IP calcitriol for treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and specific considerations for its use in PD patients.",
