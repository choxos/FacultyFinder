  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare mothers' views at 2 years postpartum after participation in a randomized trial of planned Caesarean and planned vaginal birth for a singleton fetus in breech presentation at term. STUDY DESIGN: In selected centres in the Term Breech Trial, mothers completed a structured questionnaire at approximately 2 years postpartum to assess their likes and dislikes about their childbirth experiences and their views about their intrapartum care and care providers. RESULTS: Of 1159 mothers from 85 centres, 917 (79.1%) completed a follow-up questionnaire at 2 years postpartum. Baseline information was similar for both the planned Caesarean and planned vaginal birth groups. Planned Caesarean was associated with less worry about the baby's health (P < 0.001). While other differences were noted in likes and dislikes about their childbirth experiences, women's evaluations of the quality of intrapartum care, the helpfulness of staff, and their involvement in decision-making did not differ in the planned Caesarean delivery and planned vaginal birth groups. CONCLUSION: Planned mode of delivery influences aspects of women's evaluations of their childbirth experiences but does not affect evaluations of the quality of intrapartum care, support from care providers, or amount of involvement in decision-making.",
