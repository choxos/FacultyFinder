  "abstract": "Safety of chemoimmunotherapy during pregnancy for treatment of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) is controversial. We review 37 cases of mothers with high grade NHL treated with rituximab and concurrent chemotherapy during pregnancy. Majority (95%) of mothers were treated in their second and third trimester, and a median of 4 cycles of combination therapy was administered. Complete remission occurred in 14/17 (82%) mothers whose disease outcomes were reported. There were 2 spontaneous abortions and 1 trimester fetal death that occurred in 3 mothers who received treatment in their first and second trimesters. Among the 34 (92%) live births, there were 6 cases of respiratory/cardiac complications requiring intervention and 5 cases of hematologic abnormalities reported. This review highlights the efficacy and safety of chemoimmunotherapy for mothers treated in second and third trimester. Further data is needed to establish recommendations for management of mothers with aggressive NHL in their first trimester of pregnancy.",
