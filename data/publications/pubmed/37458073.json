  "title": "Kukaa Salama (Staying Safe): a pre-post trial of an interactive informational mobile health intervention for increasing COVID-19 prevention practices with urban refugee youth in Uganda.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tailored coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevention strategies are needed for urban refugee youth in resource-constrained contexts. We developed an 8-wk interactive informational mobile health intervention focused on COVID-19 prevention practices informed by the Risk, Attitude, Norms, Ability, Self-regulation-or RANAS-approach. METHODS: We conducted a pre-post trial with a community-recruited sample of refugee youth aged 16-24 y in Kampala, Uganda. Data were collected before (T1) and immediately following (T2) the intervention, and at the 16-wk follow up (T3), to examine changes in primary (COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy) and secondary outcomes (COVID-19 risk awareness, attitudes, norms and self-regulation practices; depression; sexual and reproductive health [SRH] access; food/water security; COVID-19 vaccine acceptability). RESULTS: Participants (n=346; mean age: 21.2 [SD 2.6] y; cisgender women: 50.3%; cisgender men: 48.0%; transgender persons: 1.7%) were largely retained (T2: n=316, 91.3%; T3: n=302, 87.3%). In adjusted analyses, COVID-19 prevention self-efficacy, risk awareness, attitudes and vaccine acceptance increased significantly from T1 to T2, but were not sustained at T3. Between T1 and T3, COVID-19 norms and self-regulation significantly increased, while community violence, water insecurity and community SRH access decreased. CONCLUSIONS: Digital approaches for behaviour change hold promise with urban refugee youth but may need booster messaging and complementary programming for sustained effects.",
