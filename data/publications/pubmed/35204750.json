  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) incidence is increasing worldwide at an alarming rate. Considering this increase, prevention efforts, stemming from scientific research, health education, and public policies, are critical. Clinical studies evidenced that healthy lifestyles along with natural multitarget and disease-modifying agents have a preventative impact on AD or mitigate symptoms in diagnosed patients. The pathological alterations of AD start 30 years before symptoms, and it is essential to develop the capacity to detect those changes. In this regard, molecular biomarkers that detect early pathological manifestations are helpful. Based on markers data, early preventive interventions could reduce more than 40% of AD cases. Protective actions include exercise, shown to induce neurogenesis, cognitive stimulation, intellectual-social activity, and nutrition among others. Mediterranean diet, preprobiotics, and nutraceuticals containing bioactive molecules with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties are relevant. Antiprotein aggregation molecules whose mechanisms were described are important. Anti-inflammatory agents with anti-aggregation properties that help to control cognitive impairment, include quercetin, biocurcumin, rosemarinic acid, and Andean shilajit. Anthocyanidins, e.g., delphinidin, malvidin, and natural flavonoids, are also included. Quercetin and hydroxy-tyrosol are antiaging molecules and could have anti-AD properties. We emphasize the relevance of nutraceuticals as a main actor in the prevention and/or control of dementia and particularly AD.",
