  "title": "Impaired autophagy-accelerated senescence of alveolar type II epithelial cells drives pulmonary fibrosis induced by single-walled carbon nanotubes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rapid increase in production and application of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has led to wide public concerns in their potential risks to human health. Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs), as an extensively applied type of CNTs, have shown strong capacity to induce pulmonary fibrosis in animal models, however, the intrinsic mechanisms remain uncertain. RESULTS: In vivo experiments, we showed that accelerated senescence of alveolar type II epithelial cells (AECIIs) was associated with pulmonary fibrosis in SWCNTs-exposed mice, as well as SWCNTs-induced fibrotic lungs exhibited impaired autophagic flux in AECIIs in a time dependent manner. In vitro, SWCNTs exposure resulted in profound dysfunctions of MLE-12 cells, characterized by impaired autophagic flux and accelerated cellular senescence. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from SWCNTs-exposed MLE-12 cells promoted fibroblast-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT). Additionally, restoration of autophagy flux with rapamycin significantly alleviated SWCNTs-triggered senescence and subsequent FMT whereas inhibiting autophagy using 3-MA aggravated SWCNTs-triggered senescence in MLE-12 cells and FMT. CONCLUSION: SWCNTs trigger senescence of AECIIs by impairing autophagic flux mediated pulmonary fibrosis. The findings raise the possibility of senescence-related cytokines as potential biomarkers for the hazard of CNTs exposure and regulating autophagy as an appealing target to halt CNTs-induced development of pulmonary fibrosis.",
