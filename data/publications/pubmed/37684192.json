  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate coronary artery integrity after very high radiation doses from intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) in the setting of source asymmetry. METHODS: Ten patients treated for right coronary artery (RCA) in-stent restenosis (ISR) between 2017 and 2021 and for whom follow-up angiograms were available were identified from departmental records. Procedural angiograms, taken to document source position, were used to estimate vascular wall doses. The 2.5 mm proximal source marker was used to estimate the distance from source center to the media and adventitia. Distances were converted to dose (Gy) using the manufacturers' dose fall-off table, measured in water. Follow-up films were scrutinized for any sign of late vascular damage. RESULTS: The average minimal distance from catheter center to the adjacent media and the adventitia was 0.9 mm (±0.2) mm and 1.4 mm (±0.2), respectively. The average maximum media and adventitial doses adjacent to the source were 75 Gy (±26) and 39 Gy (±14), respectively. Follow-up angiograms were available from 0.6 years to 3.9 years following IVBT (median: 1.6 years). No IVBT-treated vascular segment showed signs of degeneration, dissection or aneurysm. CONCLUSION: IVBT vascular wall doses are frequently far higher than prescribed. The lack of complications in this unselected group of patients gives a modicum of reassurance that raising the prescription dose is unlikely to lead to a sudden appearance of complications.",
