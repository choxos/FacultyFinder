  "title": "Risk factor control for coronary artery disease secondary prevention in large randomized trials.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated data from 3 federally funded trials that focused on optimal medical therapy to determine if formalized attempts at risk factor control within clinical trials are effective in achieving guideline-driven treatment goals for diabetic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). BACKGROUND: Despite clear evidence of benefit for CAD secondary prevention, the level of risk factor control in clinical practice has been disappointing. METHODS: We obtained data from the COURAGE (Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation) diabetes subgroup, (n = 766 of 2,287), the BARI 2D (Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes) trial (n = 2,368), and the FREEDOM (Comparison of Two Treatments for Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease in Individuals With Diabetes) trial (n = 1,900) to evaluate the proportion of patients achieving guideline-based, protocol-driven treatment targets for systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking cessation, and hemoglobin A1c. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of diabetic CAD patients meeting all 4 pre-specified targets at 1 year after enrollment. RESULTS: The pooled data include 5,034 diabetic patients. The percentages of patients achieving the 1-year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets compared with baseline increased from 55% to 77% in COURAGE, from 59% to 75% in BARI 2D, and from 34% to 42% in FREEDOM. Although similar improved trends were seen for systolic blood pressure, glycemic control, and smoking cessation, only 18% of the COURAGE diabetes subgroup, 23% of BARI 2D patients, and 8% of FREEDOM patients met all 4 pre-specified treatment targets at 1 year of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of diabetic CAD patients fail to achieve pre-specified targets for 4 major modifiable cardiovascular risk factors in clinical trials. We conclude that fundamentally new thinking is needed to explore approaches to achieve optimal secondary prevention treatment goals.
