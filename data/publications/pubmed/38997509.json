  "title": "A cross-sectional study on the self-management of asthma and asthma control among adult asthmatic patients in the Aseer region, KSA.",
  "abstract": "Proper management of asthma is crucial for maintaining control over the disease and has a significant impact on the patient's overall condition. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent of self-management and the level of Asthma control in the patients from the Aseer region of Saudi Arabia, as well as to investigate determinants of illness control. A study was conducted using quantitative cross-sectional methods. Researchers utilised a web-based, self-administered structured questionnaire to gather data. The questionnaire included three sections: a socio-demographic section, an Asthma Self-Management Questionnaire (ASMQ), and Asthma Control Test (ACT). An analysis using the chi-square test was conducted to determine if there was a notable connection between the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants and the level of asthma control. A total of 305 responses were collected. The average score for the Asthma Self-Management Questionnaire was 5.72, which corresponds to 40.9%. Based on the scores from the Asthma Control Test, it was found that 60 patients (20.0%) had asthma that was not under control, 94 (30.0%) had asthma that was partially controlled, and 151 (50.0%) had asthma that was well controlled. Factors such as gender, non-smoking status, and having asthma for over 10 years (p Ë‚0.05) were found to be strongly correlated with improved disease control. Significant gaps were found in patients' awareness of the most important and critical aspects concerning the condition, medications, and preventative actions that limit asthma aggravation. To address the current situation, hospitals and clinics must make substantial efforts.",
