  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chest masculinization surgery is the most common gender-affirming procedure performed in transgender and gender-diverse individuals. While evidence on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) impact of chest masculinization is starting to emerge, data on health state utility values (HSUVs) associated with the surgery is largely missing. The objectives of this study were to estimate the HSUVs using EQ-5D for patients seeking chest masculinization surgery and assess the determinants of EQ-5D score at 6 months postoperatively. METHODS: Patients seeking chest masculinization at a single community plastic surgery clinic by 2 surgeons completed 3 patient-reported outcome measures - EQ-5D-3L, Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9, and BODY-Q Chest module - preoperatively and postoperatively at 6 weeks and 6-months. Friedman test was used to assess the differences in PROM scores at the 3 timepoints. Simple and backward stepwise regression analyses of 6-month postoperative EQ-5D scores were performed. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients (mean [SD] age, 25.7 [6.9] years) were included. The mean [SD] EQ-5D scores at preoperative, postoperative 6 weeks and 6 months were 0.81 [0.15], 0.84 [0.15] and 0.87 [0.12], respectively. Postoperatively, problems were most frequently reported in the dimensions \"pain/discomfort\" and \"anxiety/depression\". Preoperative PHQ-9 score was a predictor of 6-month postoperative EQ-5D scores following simple (p < 0.01) and backward stepwise linear regression analysis (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Chest masculinization was associated with an improvement in overall HRL at 6 months postoperatively; however, this did not achieve statistical significance. Preoperative depression severity was a significant determinant of postoperative HRL. Consequently, additional support must be offered to patients who have a higher level of preoperative depression.",
