  "abstract": "We aim to describe the diagnosis and surgical management of urinary tract endometriosis (UTE). We detail current diagnostic tools, including advanced transvaginal ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and surgical diagnostic tools such as cystourethroscopy. While discussing surgical treatment options, we emphasize the importance of an interdisciplinary team for complex cases that involve the urinary tract. While bladder deep endometriosis (DE) is more straightforward in its surgical treatment, ureteral DE requires a high level of surgical skill. Specialists should be aware of the important entity of UTE, due to the serious health implications for women. When UTE exists, it is important to work within an interdisciplinary radiological and surgical team.",
