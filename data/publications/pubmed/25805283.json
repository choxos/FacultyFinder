  "title": "Methodological guide to adopting new aesthetic surgical innovations.",
  "abstract": "Aesthetic surgery is known for its prolific introduction of new techniques, devices, and products. The implementation of any aesthetic innovation, however, may inadvertently expose patients to potential complications and adverse events. How do we decide whether a new technique or technology is superior-in both safety and effectiveness-compared with prevailing interventions? In this paper, we present some basic steps anchored in evidence-based surgery that aesthetic surgeons need to pursue in the adoption of a new technique, technology, or product. These steps include: (1) gaining familiarity with and understanding the levels of evidence; (2) performing an effective literature search; (3) formulating a critical appraisal of an article; (4) making the decision to adopt or reject; (5) recognizing the need for continued assessment; (6) acknowledging the need for education and credentialing; and (7) translation of the gathered knowledge. We hope that this paper will foster critical thinking and reduce the reliance on \"photographic evidence\" in aesthetic surgery literature.",
