  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few prospective trials in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical living donor (LD) renal transplantation exist. This prospective study evaluated a corticosteroid (CS)-free, calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) minimization immunosuppressive regimen in HLA-identical LD renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Twenty HLA-identical LD recipients were prospectively enrolled. Immunosuppression included mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (2 g/day), tacrolimus (target trough 4-8 ng/mL), sirolimus (target trough 6-10 ng/mL), and no pre- or postoperative steroids. In the absence of prior rejection, tacrolimus was discontinued at posttransplant day 120 and sirolimus at 1 year, leaving patients on MMF monotherapy. RESULTS: Tacrolimus was successfully withdrawn in 94% of patients (16/17). One hundred percent (15/15) of patients who reached 1-year posttransplant had sirolimus discontinued. Ninety-four percent (17/18) of patients remain off CSs. Mean serum creatinine at 6, 12, and 24 months were 1.38+/-0.32, 1.35+/-0.37, and 1.25+/-0.29 mg/dL; corresponding mean calculated creatinine clearance estimates were 70+/-18, 73+/-17, and 72+/-15 mL/min. Acute cellular rejection, chronic allograft nephropathy, and CNI toxicity were not observed. Death-censored graft survival was 100% at last follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A CS-free, CNI minimization immunosuppressive regimen with weaning to MMF monotherapy provides excellent renal function, graft survival, and patient survival in HLA-identical LD renal transplant recipients.",
