  "title": "The impact of surgical randomised controlled trials on the management of FAI syndrome: a citation analysis.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To identify and assess the clinical impact of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the surgical management of femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) through a citation analysis. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL were searched from inception to April 22, 2023 for RCTs assessing the surgical management of FAIS. Study characteristics were directly abstracted from included trials and citation metrics were obtained from the Clarivate Web of Knowledge database on May 19, 2023. The continuous fragility index (CFI) was calculated for eligible outcomes. Univariate regression models were used to explore correlations between total citations per year and various study characteristics. RESULTS: Ten studies comprising one thousand two hundred ninetypatients were eligible for analysis. Studies were published from 2013 to 2023. Eight countries were represented across various trials with 91% being either North American or European. The mean journal impact factor of published studies was 39.684 (median 2.982; range 1.31-202.73). The mean citation density was 14.17 (range 0.33-48.67). The median CFI was 4.8 (range 1-32.2). Correlation analysis demonstrated strong and statistically significant correlations to study sample size (R = 0.75, p = 0.012), journal impact factor (R = 0.80, p = 0.006) and continuous fragility index (R = 0.95, p = 0.015). CONCLUSION: Trials assessing the surgical management of FAIS present with a wide range of clinical uptake based on citation density and are published in journals of broadly variable impact factor. Despite promising citation metrics, high-quality evidence on arthroscopy for FAIS is limited to the United States and Europe with an unclear international impact. Future knowledge translation efforts are warranted to maximise the international uptake of evidence regarding arthroscopic management of FAIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: I.",
