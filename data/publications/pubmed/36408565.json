  "title": "A Bayesian adaptive design for clinical trials of rare efficacy outcomes with multiple definitions.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Bayesian adaptive designs for clinical trials have gained popularity in the recent years due to the flexibility and efficiency that they offer. We consider the scenario where the outcome of interest comprises events with relatively low risk of occurrence and different case definitions resulting in varying control group risk assumptions. This is a scenario that occurs frequently for infectious diseases in global health research. METHODS: We propose a Bayesian adaptive design that incorporates different case definitions of the outcome of interest that vary in stringency. A set of stopping rules are proposed where superiority and futility may be concluded with respect to different outcome definitions and therefore maintain a realistic probability of stopping in trials with low event rates. Through a simulation study, a variety of stopping rules and design configurations are compared. RESULTS: The simulation results are provided in an interactive web application that allows the user to explore and compare the design operating characteristics for a variety of assumptions and design parameters with respect to different outcome definitions. The results for select simulation scenarios are provided in the article. DISCUSSION: Bayesian adaptive designs offer the potential for maximizing the information learned from the data collected through clinical trials. The proposed design enables monitoring and utilizing multiple composite outcomes based on rare events to optimize the trial design operating characteristics.",
