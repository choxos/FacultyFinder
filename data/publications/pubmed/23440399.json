  "title": "Adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer in a patient with primary autoimmune neutropenia.",
  "abstract": "We report an extremely rare and complex case of a 44-year-old woman diagnosed with an early stage triple negative breast cancer in the setting of primary autoimmune neutropenia with a pre-existing severe neutropenia. This case-report demonstrates that adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer can be administered in a patient with severe neutropenia. The management is however complicated and requires careful monitoring of side-effects related to both chemotherapy and treatment of autoimmune neutropenia. The role of chemotherapy in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer, the approach to autoimmune neutropenia and potential interactions are reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first case reporting on the use of chemotherapy in a patient with severe pre-existing primary autoimmune neutropenia.",
