  "abstract": "We conducted a study to evaluate the outcomes and complications of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of 2-, 3-, and 4-part proximal humerus fractures using a standard management protocol with locking plates. Of 72 patients with acute proximal humerus fractures managed with ORIF and locking plates, 63 were available at the minimum follow-up of 1 year and met the inclusion criteria. At each follow-up, radiographs were reviewed for healing, hardware failure, osteonecrosis, shoulder range of motion, and DASH (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand) scores; any complications were recorded. Mean age was 62 years and mean follow-up was 19 months. There were 12 two-part fractures, 42 three-part fractures, and 9 four-part fractures. Thirteen patients had complications. Mean shoulder forward elevation was 135; patients with complications had a significantly lower mean forward elevation (P=.002). DASH scores were significantly lower in patients without complications than in those with complications (P=.01). Although excellent outcomes can be achieved when locking plates are used to manage proximal humerus fractures, complications are possible. Physicians must weigh the functional outcome data when considering management options for these types of injuries.",
