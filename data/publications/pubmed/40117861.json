  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Discussants of potentially practice-changing randomized clinical trials (RCTs) at major cancer meetings have an important responsibility to place new research in the context of current cancer care, to assess the generalizability of the data, to evaluate whether the outcomes are meaningful to patients, and to convey this information effectively and objectively to a diverse audience. Without a standard approach to critiquing clinical trial design or results discussants may overlook key weaknesses in their commentary. COMMON SENSE ONCOLOGY (CSO): The CSO initiative was launched in 2023 and is now comprised of an international collective of >â€¯1000 clinicians, academics, policymakers, and patients. Its primary vision is that patients should have access to cancer treatments that provide meaningful improvements in outcomes, irrespective of where they live. To do this, one focus is to try to improve evidence generation and reporting. GUIDANCE FOR DISCUSSANTS: As part of this work, the CSO RCT Working Group has identified key elements for use in the development of discussant presentations to facilitate a balanced high-quality examination of RCTs. Elements include assessment of: a) Study design: evaluation of the study question, selection of population and control arm, use of blinding, choice of primary and secondary endpoints; b) Study results: treatment delivery, use of crossover, impact of censoring, unplanned analyses, patient reported outcomes, adverse effects; and c) Conclusions: Appraise the value and generalizability of trial results and, when positive results are claimed, assess if they offer meaningful benefits over current standard(s) of care in outcomes of importance to patients.",
