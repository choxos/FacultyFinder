  "title": "A Call-to-Action for Clinicians to Implement Evidence-Based Best Practices When Caring for Women with Uterine Fibroids.",
  "abstract": "Uterine fibroids are common benign tumors that occur in up to 80% of women. Approximately half of the women affected experience considerable physical, psychological, and economic burdens and impact on quality of life due to symptoms such as heavy menstrual bleeding, pelvic pain, and infertility. Several medical and surgical options are available to treat uterine fibroids; however, healthcare providers may benefit from practical guidance in the development of individualized treatment plans based on a personalized approach. Medical treatments and minimally invasive procedures are generally preferred by most patients before considering more invasive, higher risk surgical interventions. In general, patient-centered, uterine-preserving procedures may be prioritized based on the patient's goals and the clinical scenario. Occasionally, hysterectomy may be the preferred treatment option for some patients who require definitive treatment. This call-to-action highlights recent challenges to patient care, including radical shifts in physician-patient interactions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent changes to evidence-based, clinically approved therapies. This report also reviews contemporary recommendations for women's health providers in the diagnosis and medical and surgical management of uterine fibroids. This call-to-action aims to empower healthcare providers to optimize the quality of care for women with uterine fibroids utilizing the best available evidence and best practices.",
