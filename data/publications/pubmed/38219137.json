  "title": "Editorial Commentary: Borderline Hip Dysplasia Combined With Increased Anteversion and Ligamentum Teres Disruption Is a Recipe for Hip Microinstability.",
  "abstract": "The ligamentum teres (LT) is known to play a role as a secondary stabilizer of the hip joint. LT tears can be associated with hip instability. In patients with borderline developmental dysplasia of the hip (BDDH), the correlation between LT tears and microinstability is even more pronounced because of the increased mechanical stress placed on the ligament. This relationship may lead certain surgeons to consider new indications for LT reconstructions. However, caution is warranted regarding the potential role of LT reconstruction in these patients, particularly since the primary deficiency in BDDH is bony undercoverage. Addressing this bony undercoverage should be a primary consideration that may be supplemented with other procedures, which may include addressing soft-tissue injuries around the hip such as LT tears. This is especially the case in those patients with persistent symptoms after management of labral tears or LT disruption.",
