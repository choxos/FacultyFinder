  "abstract": "SUBJECT AND AIM: At present, only little information is available on the within-flock prevalence of Salmonella enterica subspecies diarizonae serovar 61: k: 1, 5, (7) (SASd) in sheep flocks in Germany as well as their possible influencing factors. The aim of the study was to investigate relationships between flock size, breed and within-flock prevalence. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1610 clinically healthy ewes from 14 sheep flocks of 9 different breeds aged 2 to 12 years were microbiologically tested for SASd by nasal swab and fecal samples. Linear multivariable models were used to analyse the associations between within-flock prevalence and farm factors (flock size, breed) or detection frequencies in fecal or nasal swabs. RESULTS: SASd was detected in all sheep flocks examined, with 75% of adults having at least one positive nasal or fecal result. In comparison to the 11 flocks in which commercial breeds were kept, the 3 flocks of landraces had a lower apparent within-flock prevalence (p=0.01). No association with herd size was evident. With respect to the age of the ewes, there was a negative relationship (p=0.05) with the frequency of detection of SASd in the nasal swab but not in the fecal swab. The health status and fertility performance of the flocks were in line with a normal range for commercial sheep flocks, with lambing losses of 5% to 10% and lambing scores of 130% to 158%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the high prevalence of SASd infections particularly within commercial breeds, there was no evidence of a relevant risk to sheep health. Compared with commercial breed flocks, a lower spread of SASd within flocks keeping landraces was evident. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Despite a high prevalence, infections with SASd are very unlikely to lead to clinical symptoms or disease. Regulation and monitoring of SASd in sheep are of low priority for animal health authorities.",
