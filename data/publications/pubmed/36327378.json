  "abstract": "Family-Based Treatment (FBT)-the most widely supported treatment for pediatric eating disorders-transitioned to virtual delivery in many programs due to COVID-19. Using a blended implementation approach, we systematically examined therapist adherence to key components of FBT and fidelity to FBT by videoconferencing (FBT-V), preliminary patient outcomes, and team experiences with our FBT-V implementation approach as well as familial perceptions of FBT-V effectiveness. We examined our implementation approach across four pediatric eating disorder programs in Ontario, Canada, using mixed methods. Participants included therapists (n = 8), medical practitioners (n = 4), administrators (n = 6), and families (n = 5; 21 family members in total). We developed implementation teams at each site, provided FBT-V training, and offered clinical and implementation consultation. Therapists submitted video recordings of their first four FBT-V sessions for fidelity rating, and patient outcomes. Therapists self-reported readiness, attitudes, confidence, and adherence to FBT-V. Focus groups were conducted with each team and family after the first four sessions of FBT-V. Quantitative data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA. Qualitative data were analyzed using directed and summative content analysis. Therapists adhered to key FBT components and maintained FBT-V fidelity. Changes in therapists' readiness, attitudes, and confidence in FBT-V over time were not significant. All patients gained weight. Focus groups revealed implementation facilitators/barriers, positives/negatives surrounding FBT-V training and consultation, suggestions for improvement, and effectiveness attributed to FBT-V. Our implementation approach appeared to be feasible and acceptable. Future research with a larger sample is required, furthering our understanding of this approach and exploring how organizational factors influence treatment fidelity.",
