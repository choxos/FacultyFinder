  "title": "Effect of Baduanjin exercise for hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of Baduanjin exercise for hypertension. Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CNKI, VIP, CBM and Wanfang databases were searched. Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified. Baduanjin significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (SBP) (WMD=-13.00 mmHg; 95% CI: -21.24 to -4.77; P=0.002), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD=-6.13 mmHg; 95% CI: -11.20 to -1.07; P=0.02), body mass index, blood glucose, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and improved high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and quality of life compared to no intervention. No significant difference between Baduanjin and antihypertensive drugs on SBP (WMD=1.05 mmHg; 95% CI: -2.07 to 4.17; P=0.51) or DBP (WMD=1.90 mmHg; 95% CI: -1.22 to 5.02; P=0.23) was identified. Baduanjin plus antihypertensive drugs significantly reduced SBP (WMD=-7.49 mmHg; 95% CI: -11.39 to -3.59; P=0.0002), DBP (WMD=-3.55 mmHg; 95% CI: -5.25 to -1.85; P<0.0001), blood glucose, and total cholesterol compared to antihypertensive drugs. Baduanjin is an effective therapy for hypertension. However, further rigorously designed RCTs are still warranted.",
