  "abstract": "The Canadian/American regional group of the International Clinical Epidemiology Network (INCLEN) invites SGIM members to join in an international network dedicated to improving health in low and middle-income countries and reducing health disparities in North America-not only because many goals and activities of the 2 organizations are compatible such as evidence-based medicine, mentoring, and training; but because collaboration between SGIM and INCLEN could strengthen both groups. With increasing brain drain from the developing world to the North, there is an ever-increasing need for academic contributions from the North to swing the balance toward brain gain for the South. SGIM members have the academic expertise to make an important contribution to global health. Participation and contribution from SGIM members is welcomed at the individual or organizational level. We invite you to explore possible partnership and collaboration.",
