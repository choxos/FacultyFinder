  "title": "Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors Improve Cardiovascular Dysfunction in Type 2 Diabetic East Asians.",
  "abstract": "In East Asians, the incidence of type 2 DM (T2DM) has increased as a result of major alterations in life. Cardiovascular problems are more likely in those with T2DM. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel insulin-independent antihyperglycemic drugs that limit renal glucose reabsorption and thereby improve glycemic control. They are used alone or in combination with insulin and other antihyperglycemic medications to treat diabetes, and they are also helpful in protecting against the progression of complications. This review has evaluated the available evidence not only on the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in T2DM, but also on their favourable cardiovascular events in East Asians. DM is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. As a result, in addition to glycemic control in diabetes management, the therapeutic goal in East Asian diabetic patients should be to improve adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Besides establishing antidiabetic effects, several studies have reported cardioprotective benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors via numerous pathways. SGLT2 inhibitors show promising antidiabetic drugs with potential cardiovascular advantages, given that a high number of diabetic patients in East Asia have co-existing cardiovascular disorders. Despite significant positive results in favour of SGLT2, more research is needed to determine how SGLT2 inhibitors exert these impressive cardiovascular effects.",
