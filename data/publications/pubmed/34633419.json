  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric surveillance study of children and adolescents with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). OBJECTIVES: To examine the incidence and age- and sex-specific differences in the clinical presentation of ARFID in children and adolescents in Canada. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cross-sectional study, patients with ARFID were identified through the Canadian Paediatric Surveillance Program by surveying 2700 Canadian pediatricians monthly from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The incidence of ARFID in Canadian children (5-18 years of age) and age- and sex-specific clinical characteristics at presentation. RESULTS: In total, 207 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 13.1 [3.2] years; 127 [61.4%] female) were included in this study. The incidence of ARFID in children 5 to 18 years of age was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.76-2.31) per 100 000 patients. Older children and adolescents were more likely to endorse eating too little (5-9 years of age: 76.7%; 95% CI, 58%-88.6; 10-14 years of age: 90.9%; 95% CI, 84.6%-94.8%; 15-18 years of age: 95.6%; 95% CI, 83.6%-98.9%; P = .02), have a loss of appetite (5-9 years of age: 53.3%; 95% CI, 35.4%-70.4%; 10-14 years of age: 74.2%; 95% CI, 66.0%-81.0%; 15-18 years of age: 80.0%; 95% CI, 65.5%-89.4%; P = .03), be medically compromised (mean body mass index z score: 10-14 vs 5-9 years of age: -1.31; 95% CI, -2.0 to -0.6; 15-18 vs 5-9 years of age: -1.35; 95% CI, -2.2 to -0.5; 15-18 vs 10-14 years of age: -0.04; 95% CI, -0.6 to 0.5; P < .001; mean percentage of treatment goal weight: 10-14 vs 5-9 years of age: -8.6; 95% CI, -14.3 to -2.9; 15-18 vs 5-9 years of age: -9.8; 95% CI, -16.3 to -3.3; 15-18 vs 10-14 years of age: -1.2; 95% CI, -5.8 to 3.4; P < .001; mean heart rate (beats per min): 10-14 vs 5-9 years of age: -10; 95% CI, -21.9 to 1.9; 15-18 vs 5-9 years of age: -19.7; 95% CI, -33.1 to -6.2; 15-18 vs 10-14 years of age: -9.7; 95% CI, -18.7 to -0.7; P = .002), have higher rates of anxiety (5-9 years of age: 26.7%; 95% CI, 13.7-45.4; 10-14 years of age: 52.3%; 95% CI, 43.7%-60.7%; 15-18 years of age: 53.3%; 95% CI, 38.6%-67.5%; P = .03) and depression (5-9 years of age: 0%; 10-14 years of age: 6.8%; 95% CI, 3.6%-12.7%; 15-18 years of age: 26.7%; 95% CI, 15.7%-41.6%; P < .001), and be more likely to be hospitalized (5-9 years of age: 13.3%; 95% CI, 5.0%-31.1%; 10-14 years of age: 41.7%; 95% CI, 33.5%-50.3%; 15-18 years of age: 55.6%; 95% CI, 40.7%-69.5%; P = .001). Younger children were more likely to endorse lack of interest in food (5-9 years of age: 56.7%; 95% CI, 38.4%-73.2%; 10-14 years of age: 75.0%; 95% CI, 66.8%-81.7%; 15-18 years of age: 57.8%; 95% CI, 42.8%-71.4%; P = .03), avoidance of certain foods (5-9 years of age: 90.0%; 95% CI, 72.6%-96.8%; 10-14 years of age: 69.7%; 95% CI, 61.3%-77.0%; 15-18 years of age: 62.2%; 95% CI, 47.2%-75.3%; P = .03), and refusal based on sensory characteristics (5-9 years of age: 66.7%; 95% CI, 47.9%-81.3%; 10-14 years of age: 38.6%; 95% CI, 30.7%-47.3%; 15-18 years of age: 22.2%; 95% CI, 12.3%-36.9%; P < .001). Eating but not enough was more common in girls (75.0%; 95% CI, 64.1%-83.4%) vs boys (68.5%; 95% CI, 59.8%-76.1; P = .04), and boys had a higher rate of refusal based on sensory characteristics (51.2%; 95% CI, 40.2%-62.2%) compared with girls (31.5%; 95% CI, 23.9%-40.2%; P = .007). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study suggests that ARFID is a relatively common eating disorder and is associated with important age- and sex- specific clinical characteristics that may help in early recognition and timely treatment of the presenting symptoms.",
