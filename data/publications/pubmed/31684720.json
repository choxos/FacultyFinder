  "title": "Free-Standing InAs Nanobelts Driven by Polarity in MBE.",
  "abstract": "In this study, we demonstrated the Au-catalyzed growth of free-standing defect-free zinc-blende structured InAs nanobelts on the GaAs {111}B substrate by molecular beam epitaxy. Through detailed morphological, chemical, and structural characterizations using advanced electron microscopy, it was found that the nanobelts grew along the ⟨001̅⟩ direction, induced by Au catalysts via vapor-solid-solid mechanism, with features of {001̅} catalyst/nanobelt interfaces and extensive {11̅0} surfaces. The formation of the belt-shaped morphology of our nanostructures resulted from a faster lateral growth rate along the ±[110] direction than that along the ±[11̅0] direction, driven by polarity. This study provides insights into understanding the growth of free-standing zinc-blende structured <001̅> InAs nanobelts.",
