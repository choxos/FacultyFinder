  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of individualized herbal decoction with standard decoction for patients with stable bronchiectasis through N-of-1 trials. METHODS: We conducted a single center N-of-1 trials in 17 patients with stable bronchiectasis. Each N-of-1 trial contains three cycles. Each cycle is divided into two 4-week intervention including individualized decoction and fixed decoction (control). The primary outcome was patient self-reported symptoms scores on a 1-7 point Likert scale. Secondary outcomes were 24-hour sputum volume and CAT scores. RESULTS: Among 14 completed trials, five showed that the individualized decoction was statistically better than the control decoction on symptom scores (P < 0.05) but was not clinically significant. The group data of all the trials showed that individualized decoction was superior to control decoction on symptom scores (2.13 ± 0.58 versus 2.30 ± 0.65, P = 0.002, mean difference and 95% CI: 0.18 (0.10, 0.25)), 24 h sputum volume (P = 0.009), and CAT scores (9.69 ± 4.89 versus 11.64 ± 5.59, P = 0.013, mean difference and 95% CI: 1.95 (1.04, 2.86)) but not clinically significant. CONCLUSION: Optimizing the combined analysis of individual and group data and the improvement of statistical models may make contribution in establishing a method of evaluating clinical efficacy in line with the characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine individual diagnosis and treatment.",
