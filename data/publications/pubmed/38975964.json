  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with organic gastrointestinal (GI) diseases and diabetes mellitus (DM) can have concomitant disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the global prevalence of DGBI-compatible symptom profiles in adults with and without self-reported organic GI diseases or DM. METHODS: Data were collected in a population-based internet survey in 26 countries, the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study (n = 54,127). Individuals were asked if they had been diagnosed by a doctor with gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer, coeliac disease, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), diverticulitis, GI cancer or DM. Individuals not reporting the organic diagnosis of interest were included in the reference group. DGBI-compatible symptom profiles were based on Rome IV diagnostic questions. Odds ratios (ORs [95% confidence interval]) were calculated using mixed logistic regression models. RESULTS: Having one of the investigated organic GI diseases was linked to having any DGBI-compatible symptom profile ranging from OR 1.64 [1.33, 2.02] in GI cancer to OR 3.22 [2.80, 3.69] in IBD. Those associations were stronger than for DM, OR 1.26 [1.18, 1.35]. Strong links between organic GI diseases and DGBI-compatible symptom profiles were seen for corresponding (e.g., IBD and bowel DGBI) and non-corresponding (e.g., IBD and esophageal DGBI) anatomical regions. The strongest link was seen between fecal incontinence and coeliac disease, OR 6.94 [4.95, 9.73]. After adjusting for confounding factors, associations diminished, but persisted. CONCLUSION: DGBI-compatible symptom profiles are more common in individuals with self-reported organic GI diseases and DM compared to the general population. The presence of these concomitant DGBIs should be considered in the management of organic (GI) diseases.",
