  "title": "Surgical Management of Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Is Associated With Improved Disease Resolution: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Optimal management approaches for medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) using either surgical or nonsurgical approaches remain inconclusive. Our objective was to compare the effects of surgical versus nonsurgical therapy on the resolution of MRONJ. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of eligible patients with a diagnosis of MRONJ at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, who either were seen in the outpatient clinic from January 2014 to December 2016 or received major surgical intervention from January 2011 to December 2016. A multivariate logistic regression was conducted to evaluate the effects of surgical therapy on disease resolution. RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were included in this study. Of these, 56 (72%) received surgical therapy. Antiresorptive agents were being taken for the treatment of osteoporosis by 46 patients (82%) in the surgical group compared with 20 nonsurgical patients (91%) (P = .28). The median follow-up period was 15.5 months (interquartile range, 8.0 to 34.3 months) in the surgical group compared with 11.0 months (interquartile range, 8.0 to 20.5 months) in the nonsurgical group (P = .75). Disease resolution occurred in 39 surgical patients (70%) compared with 8 nonsurgical patients (36%). Surgical therapy was associated with disease resolution compared with nonsurgical therapy alone, after adjustment for age, duration of antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapy, whether the antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents were used for oncologic purposes, and the stage of MRONJ at initial presentation (adjusted odds ratio, 4.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.28 to 14.60). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical therapy compared with nonsurgical therapy was associated with disease resolution in patients with MRONJ. High-quality evidence of the superiority of any specific surgical approach in the treatment of MRONJ is needed.",
