  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indications for hip arthroscopy in mildly dysplastic patients with a symptomatic hip remain controversial. METHODS: This article provides a concise review of the available literature evaluating the role of hip arthroscopy in treating symptomatic dysplasia. Potential indications for hip arthroscopy in isolation are reviewed. Emerging evidence on the role of hip arthroscopy based on patient-specific pathomorphology is highlighted. RESULTS: Hip arthroscopy in isolation may be helpful for select dysplastic patients with dynamic impingement or microinstability. Isolated arthroscopic treatment of intra-articular pathology resulting from static overload is unlikely to be successful in the long term and may be detrimental. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic procedures for individuals with mild dysplasia in the absence of frank instability may be effective; however, great caution should be exercised when approaching dysplastic patients with symptomatic hips.",
