  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has disproportionately affected African, Caribbean and Black (ACB) communities in Canada. We investigated the prevalence and factors associated with HIV infection among ACB people in Ontario. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of first- and second-generation ACB people aged 15-64 years in Toronto and Ottawa (Ontario, Canada). We collected sociodemographic information, self-reported HIV status and offered dried blood spot (DBS) testing to determine the prevalence of HIV infection. Factors associated with HIV infection were investigated using regression models. RESULTS: A total of 1,380 people were interviewed and 834 (60.4%) tested for HIV. The HIV prevalence was 7.5% overall (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.1-8.0) and 6.6% (95% CI 6.1-7.1) in the adult population (15-49 years). Higher age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.8; 95% CI 2.77-2.82), birth outside of Canada (aOR 4.7; 95% CI 1.50-14.71), French language (aOR 9.83; 95% CI 5.19-18.61), unemployment (aOR 1.85; 95% CI 1.62-2.11), part-time employment (aOR 4.64; 95% CI 4.32-4.99), substance use during sex (aOR 1.66; 95% CI 1.47-1.88) and homosexual (aOR 19.68; 95% CI 7.64-50.71) and bisexual orientation (aOR 2.82; 95% CI 1.19-6.65) were associated with a positive HIV test. Those with a high school (aOR 0.01; 95% CI 0.01-0.02), college (aOR 0.00; 95% CI 0.00-0.01) or university education (aOR 0.00; 95% CI 0.00-0.01), more adequate housing (aOR 0.85; 95% CI 0.82-0.88), a higher social capital score (aOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.49-0.74) and a history of sexually transmitted infections (aOR 0.40; 95% CI 0.18-0.91) were less likely to have a positive HIV test. CONCLUSION: Human immunodeficiency virus infection is linked to sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and behavioural factors among ACB people in Ontario.",
