  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Diabetes distress (DD) has been understudied in the pregnancy population. Pregnancy is known to be a complex, highly stressful time for women with diabetes because of medical risks and the high burden of diabetes management. Our aim in this study was to explain and understand DD in women with pre-existing diabetes in pregnancy. METHODS: An explanatory, sequential mixed-methods study was undertaken. The first strand consisted of a cross-sectional study of 76 women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A nested sampling approach was used to re-recruit 18 women back into the second strand for qualitative interviews using an interpretive description approach. RESULTS: DD was measured by the validated Problem Area in Diabetes (PAID) scale. A PAID score of â‰¥40 was positive for distress. DD prevalence was 22.4% in the cross-sectional cohort and the average PAID score was 27.75 (standard deviation 16.08). In the qualitative strand, women with a range of PAID scores (10.0 to 60.0) were sampled for interviews. The majority of these participants described themes of DD in their interviews. Of the 15 women who described DD thematically, only 6 had positive PAID scores. CONCLUSIONS: Integration of the mixed-methods data underscores important meta-inferences about DD in pregnancy, namely that DD was present to a greater degree than the PAID tool is sensitive to. DD was present qualitatively in most of the qualitative sample, despite interviewing women with a range of PAID scores. Future research on a pregnancy-specific DD scale is needed.",
