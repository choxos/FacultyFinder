  "title": "Asian management of hypertension: Current status, home blood pressure, and specific concerns in China.",
  "abstract": "Increasing life expectancy in the population means that the prevalence of hypertension in China will increase over the coming decades. Although awareness and control rates have improved, the absolute rates remain unacceptably low. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest killer in China, and sharp increases in the prevalence of CVD risk factors associated with rapid lifestyle changes will contribute to ongoing morbidity and mortality. This highlights the importance of effectively diagnosing and managing hypertension, where home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) has an important role. Use of HBPM in China is increasing, particularly now that Asia-specific guidance is available, and this out-of-office BP monitoring tool will become increasingly important over time. To implement these recommendations and guidelines, a Web-based and WeChat-linked nationwide BP measurement system is being established in China. Local guidelines state that both HBPM and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be implemented where available. In China, hypertension is managed most often using calcium channel blockers, followed by angiotensin receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Key barriers to hypertension control in China are low awareness and control rates.",
