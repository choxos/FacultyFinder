  "title": "Genetic Findings of Potential Donor Origin following Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation: Recommendations on Donor Disclosure and Genetic Testing from the World Marrow Donor Association.",
  "abstract": "Following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), recipients are subjected to extensive genetic testing to monitor the efficacy of the transplantation and identify relapsing malignant disease. This testing is increasingly including the use of large gene panels, which may lead to incidental identification of genetic and molecular information of potential donor origin. Deciphering whether variants are of donor origin, and if so, whether there are clinical implications for the donor can prove challenging. In response to queries from donor registries and transplant centers regarding best practices in managing donors when genetic mutations of potential donor origin are identified, the Medical Working Group of the World Marrow Donor Association established an expert group to review available evidence and develop a framework to aid decision making. These guidelines aim to provide recommendations on predonation consenting, postdonation testing of recipients, and informing and managing donors when findings of potential donor origin are identified in recipients post-transplantation. It is recognized that registries will have different access to resources and financing structures, and thus whenever possible, we have made suggestions on how recommendations can be adapted.",
