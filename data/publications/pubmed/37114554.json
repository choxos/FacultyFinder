  "title": "An electrochemical chlorpromazine sensor based on a gold-copper bimetallic synergetic molecularly imprinted interface on an acupuncture needle electrode.",
  "abstract": "Chlorpromazine (CPZ) is a medicine for nervous system disorders. Measuring CPZ in vivo can assist doctors in evaluating patients' blood drug concentration and monitoring drug metabolism. Therefore, an accurate in vivo detection of CPZ is crucial. In recent years, the acupuncture needle, traditionally used in Chinese medicine, has emerged as a potential electrode in the field of electrochemistry, with promising applications for in vivo detection. In this study, Au/Cu nanoparticles were electrodeposited onto an acupuncture needle electrode (ANE) to improve electrical conductivity and provide an electro-catalytic surface. Subsequently, 3-aminophenylboronic acid and CPZ were attracted to each other through intermolecular forces; at the same time, the interaction force of Au-S between CPZ and the AuNPs made the polymer layer grow around the CPZ molecules on the modified electrode surface. The imprinted nanocavities showed highly selective and sensitive detection performance for CPZ after elution. Inside the recognizable site and microenvironment of the cavities, the captured CPZ molecule provided a suitable configuration for the fluent electron transfer of the electroactive group within a short range from the Au/Cu bimetal. Under ideal conditions, the MIP/Au/Cu/ANE exhibited two good linear ranges of 0.1-100 μM and 100-1000 μM with a detection limit of 0.07 μM. Moreover, the sensors showed great selectivity, good stability and excellent repeatability, making them suitable for CPZ detection in human serum. This provides a novel idea for real-time and in vivo CPZ detection.",
