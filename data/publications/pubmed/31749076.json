  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis with factor VIII (FVIII) should be individualized based on patient characteristics, including FVIII pharmacokinetics. Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modeling simplifies pharmacokinetic studies by obviating the need for multiple samples. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and inter-individual variability (IIV) of BAY 94-9027 in relation to patient characteristics in support of a popPK-tailored approach, including identifying the optimal number and timing of pharmacokinetic samples. METHODS: Pharmacokinetic samples from 198 males (aged 2‒62 years) with severe hemophilia A, enrolled in BAY 94-9027 clinical trials, were analyzed. Baseline age, height, weight, body mass index, lean body weight (LBW), von Willebrand factor (VWF) level, and race were evaluated. A popPK model was developed and used to simulate pharmacokinetic endpoints difficult to observe from measured FVIII levels, including time to maintain FVIII levels above 1, 3, and 5 IU/dL after different BAY 94-9027 doses. RESULTS: A one-compartment model adequately described BAY 94-9027 pharmacokinetics. Clearance and central volume of distribution were significantly associated with LBW; clearance was inversely correlated with VWF. Due to the monophasic pharmacokinetics and well-understood IIV sources, identification of patient pharmacokinetics was achievable with sparse blood sampling. Median predicted time to maintain FVIII levels > 1 IU/dL in patients aged ≥ 12 years ranged from 120.1 to 127.2 h after single BAY 94-9027 doses of 45‒60 IU/kg. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis evaluated the pharmacokinetics of BAY 94-9027 and its sources of IIV. Using the model, determination of individual patient pharmacokinetics was possible with few FVIII samples, and a sparse sampling design to support pharmacokinetic-guided dosing was identified.",
