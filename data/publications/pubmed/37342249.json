  "abstract": "The traditional indications for lobectomy for resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) may be set to change. Recently, anatomical segmentectomy (AS) versus lobectomy as an approach for early-stage NSCLC has been described in phase 3 randomised controlled trials. The demand for methods to facilitate AS may increase as a consequence. We describe three cases of AS using the combination of endobronchial infiltration of indocyanine green (ICG) to identify the intersegmental plane (critical for the performance of AS), and Computed Tomography (CT) guided methylene blue injection for lesion localisation. The operations were completed successfully demonstrating satisfactory post-operative outcomes including lesion resection with clear surgical margins and acceptable length of stay. We believe that endobronchial instillation of ICG and CT-guided methylene blue injection for lesion localisation show promise as a technique to complement parenchymal sparing thoracic oncological surgery.",
