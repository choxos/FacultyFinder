  "title": "Current therapies in alleviating liver disorders and cancers with a special focus on the potential of vitamin D.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver dysfunction is a topic of global concern with many advancing therapies being researched. Though vitamin D takes a center place, other therapies especially nutritional are also gaining ground. Vitamin D has gone beyond its role in skeletal disorders by showcasing its associations in other metabolic dysfunctions too. RESULT: Epidemiological evidences show a correlation between the status of vitamin D and different forms of cancer. Vitamin D receptors and alterations in gene expression appear decisive in the development of chronic liver disorders. Nutritional status therefore plays a significant role in avoiding the complications related to liver dysfunctions, making it mandatory in maintaining vitamin D sufficiency in the body. Therapies with omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, amino acids, steroids also render benefits which could be further explored. Recent research on the progression of certain forms of liver cancer using vitamin D analogs like Seocalcitol EB 1089 has shown good promise. CONCLUSION: The anti-inflammatory and immuno- regulatory properties of vitamin D makes its analogs, suitable candidates of better choice for the prevention and treatment of liver disorders and cancer.",
