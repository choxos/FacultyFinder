  "title": "Factors associated with pressure ulcer and dehydration in long-term care settings in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "Pressure ulcers and dehydration are common conditions among residents of long-term care facilities that result in negative health effects. They have been associated with signs of neglect and increased 30-day mortality among LTC residents. However, they are both preventable and with proper care can be effectively managed and treated. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to examine factors associated with pressure ulcers and dehydration among long-term care residents in the province of Ontario, Canada. Results indicated that close to one-fifth of residents were dehydrated (17.3%) or had a pressure ulcer (18.9%) during the study period. Advanced age was significantly associated with the presence of pressure ulcers and dehydration for both men and women. However, men were more likely to present with a pressure ulcer while women were more likely to exhibit symptoms of dehydration. Study findings also demonstrate the presence of both conditions being higher in municipal and not-for-profit homes compared to for-profit homes. The significant differences observed in relation to home ownership which require further investigation to identify the most relevant factors in explaining these differences. Overall, pressure ulcers and dehydration are preventable conditions that warrant attention from policymakers to ensure quality of care and resident safety are prioritized.",
