  "title": "Comparison of Multiparametric MRI-targeted and Systematic Biopsies for Detection of Cribriform and Intraductal Carcinoma Prostate Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Background Intraductal carcinoma (IDC) and invasive cribriform (Cr) subtypes of prostate cancer (PCa) are an indication of aggressiveness, but the evidence regarding whether MRI can be used to detect Cr/IDC-pattern PCa is contradictory. Purpose To compare the detection of Cr/IDC-pattern PCa at multiparametric MRI (mpMRI)-targeted biopsy versus systematic biopsy in biopsy-naive men at risk for PCa. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial that recruited participants with a clinical suspicion of PCa between April 2017 and November 2019 at five centers. Participants were randomized 1:1 to either the MRI arm or the systematic biopsy arm. Targeted biopsy was performed in participants with a Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System score of at least 3. MRI features were recorded, and biopsy slides and prostatectomy specimens were reviewed for the presence or absence of Cr/IDC histologic patterns. Comparison of Cr/IDC patterns was performed using generalized linear mixed modeling. Results A total of 453 participants were enrolled, with 226 in the systematic biopsy arm (median age, 65 years [IQR, 59-70 years]; 196 biopsies available for assessment) and 227 in the mpMRI-targeted biopsy arm (median age, 67 years [IQR, 60-72 years]; 132 biopsies available for assessment). Identification of Cr/IDC PCa was lower in the systematic biopsy arm compared with the mpMRI arm (31 of 196 biopsies [16%] vs 33 of 132 biopsies [25%]; P = .01). No evidence of a difference in mean cancer core length (CCL) (11.3 mm ± 4.4 vs 9.7 mm ± 4.5; P = .09), apparent diffusion coefficient (685 µm[2]/sec ± 178 vs 746 µm[2]/sec ± 245; P = .52), or dynamic contrast-enhanced positivity (27 [82%] vs 37 [90%]; P = .33) for clinically significant PCa (csPCa) was observed between participants with or without Cr/IDC disease in the MRI arm. Cr/IDC-positive histologic patterns overall had a higher mean CCL compared with Cr/IDC-negative csPCa (11.1 mm ± 4.4 vs 9.2 mm ± 4.1; P = .009). Conclusion MRI-targeted biopsy showed increased detection of Cr/IDC histologic patterns compared with systematic biopsy. Clinical trial registration no.
