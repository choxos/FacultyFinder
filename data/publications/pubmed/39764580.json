  "title": "Patient and wound factors associated with WOUND-Q scales measuring health-related quality of life: An international cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "The WOUND-Q is a patient-reported outcome measure for individuals with any type of chronic wound. This study aimed to identify patient and wound factors associated with the four WOUND-Q health-related quality of life (HRQL) scales: Life impact, Psychological, Sleep, and Social. Adults with a chronic wound were recruited internationally through clinical settings between August 2018 and May 2020, and through an online platform (i.e. Prolific) in September 2022. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify factors significantly associated with the WOUND-Q scales. The assessments obtained were 1273, 1275, 706, and 1256 for the Life Impact, Psychological, Sleep, and Social scales, respectively. The mean age of participants was 55 (SD = 18) years; most (66%) had a single wound, and most (56%) wounds had lasted more than 6 months. The most common causes were trauma, surgery, and diabetic foot ulcer. Wound characteristics associated with worse scores on at least one of the scales were drainage, vacuum treatment, aetiologies (i.e. diabetic foot ulcer, trauma, other, multiple), duration (i.e. 10-11 months), having four or more wounds, smell, and sleep interference, while wound location different from the face or neck was associated with better scores (p < 0.05). Patient factors associated with worse scores included having diabetes or a comorbidity, whereas increasing age or male gender were associated with better scores (p < 0.05). Sleep disturbances had the largest negative influence on HRQL scores. This study identified factors affecting HRQL in individuals with chronic wounds. Understanding these associations can inform better management and treatment strategies to improve HRQL for these patients.",
