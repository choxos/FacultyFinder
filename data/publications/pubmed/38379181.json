  "title": "Canadian clinical experience on switching from standard half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), octocog alfa, to extended half-life rFVIII, damoctocog alfa pegol, in persons with haemophilia A ≥ 12 years followed in a Comprehensive Hemophilia Care Program in Canada.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Damoctocog alfa pegol (BAY 94-9027, Jivi®) is an extended half-life recombinant factor (F)VIII replacement, indicated for the treatment of haemophilia A in patients aged ≥12 years. Following introduction of damoctocog alfa pegol in Canada in 2020, there have been no reports on routine clinical effectiveness and satisfaction, when switching from a previous FVIII product in Canada. AIM: To report changes in pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, utilization and patient satisfaction when switching to damoctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis from previous standard half-life octocog alfa (BAY 81-8973, Kovaltry®) treatment. METHODS: A single-centre, intra-patient comparison of pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes was performed. Blood samples drawn once pre-dose and ≥2 times post-dose were measured by a one-stage assay to assess pharmacokinetic parameters including area under the curve (AUC, primary endpoint). Patient-reported outcomes data were collected using the Patient-Reported Outcomes, Burdens and Experiences questionnaire (PROBE). Clinical outcomes included annualized bleeding rate (ABR) and factor utilization. RESULTS: Dose-normalized AUC was significantly increased after switch to damoctocog alfa pegol from octocog alfa. Median (quartile [Q]1; Q3) annualized bleeding rates were 0.67 (0.00; 1.33) with damoctocog alfa pegol and 1.33 (0.00; 2.67) with octocog alfa. Half of the patients receiving damoctocog alfa pegol prophylaxis experienced zero bleeds (n = 9, 50.0%) versus 38.9% (n = 7) of patients treated with octocog alfa. Patients' good quality of life was maintained. CONCLUSION: This study provides routine clinical evidence supporting the benefits of switching from octocog alfa to damoctocog alfa pegol for patients with severe haemophilia A.",
