  "title": "Endoscopic transorbital approach with electrocorticography for resection of anterior temporal lobe mass.",
  "abstract": "The authors present the case illustration of a 32-year-old female with worsening seizures with slight right orbital proptosis of unclear etiology. Imaging revealed a growing right temporal pole mass concerning for a glial tumor. The patient was an ideal candidate for transorbital endoscopic resection given its location and her epilepsy history. The mass was completely removed with the aid of electrocorticography (ECOG) to ensure no additional perilesional epileptic focus. The patient has had a 6-month follow-up with no worsening seizures and favorable cosmetic outcome. The video can be found here: https://stream.cadmore.media/r10.3171/2025.1.FOCVID24196.",
