  "abstract": "Ramipril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor that has been extensively studied in randomised, controlled clinical trials in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Therapy with ramipril in patients with various cardiovascular disorders has demonstrated significant and clinically important reductions in cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, progressive renal impairment and onset of diabetes. Ramipril is usually dosed at 2.5-10 mg/day. Beneficial effects of ramipril are observed in the treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure, prevention of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients, prevention of congestive heart failure, diabetes and other vascular events.",
