  "title": "Development of a fetal rabbit model to study amniotic band syndrome.",
  "abstract": "Amniotic band syndrome (ABS) is a group of fetal malformations caused by fibrous adherences. Species such as sheep, rats, and mice have been used to study this syndrome. We developed a fetal rabbit model using 24 fetuses from punctured uteri. We found one case of syndactyly, one case of amniotic banding, two cases of extremity deformities, one case of a tail deformity, one case of head compression, and one case of open eyelids. Other malformations have been described in an amnion rupture sequence model (exencephaly and cleft palate). The rabbit fetus is an adequate model in which to develop this syndrome.",
