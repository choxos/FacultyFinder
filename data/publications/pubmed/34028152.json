  "title": "Dread and solace: Talking about perinatal mental health.",
  "abstract": "Perinatal mental health issues are a global public health challenge. Worldwide, it is estimated that 10% of pregnant women, and 13% of women who have just given birth, experience a mental disorder. Yet, for many reasons - including stigma, limited access to services, patients' lack of awareness about symptoms, and inadequate professional intervention - actual rates of clinical and subclinical perinatal mental health issues are likely higher. Studies have explored experiences such as postpartum depression, but few involve a wider-ranging exploration of a variety of self-reported perinatal mental health issues through personal narrative. We conducted 21 narrative interviews with women, in two Canadian provinces, about their experiences of perinatal mental health issues. Our aim was to deepen understanding of how individual and cultural narratives of motherhood and perinatal mental health can be sources of shame, guilt, and suffering, but also spaces for healing and recovery. We identified four predominant themes in women's narrative: feeling like a failed mother; societal silencing of negative experiences of motherhood; coming to terms with a new sense of self; and finding solace in shared experiences. These findings are consistent with other studies that highlight the personal challenges associated with perinatal mental health issues, particularly the dread of facing societal norms of the 'good mother'. We also highlight the positive potential for healing and self-care through sharing experiences, and the power of narratives to help shape feelings of self-worth and a new identity. This study adheres to the expectations for conducting and reporting qualitative research.",
