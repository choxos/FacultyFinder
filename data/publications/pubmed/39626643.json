  "title": "Complex Thrombo-Inflammatory Responses versus Outcomes of Non-COVID-19 Community-Acquired Pneumonia and COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The thrombo-inflammatory response and outcomes of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to various organisms (non-COVID-19 CAP) versus CAP due to a single virus, SARS-CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) may differ. METHODS: Adults hospitalized with non-COVID-19 CAP (December 1, 2021-June 15, 2023) or COVID-19 (March 2, 2020-June 15, 2023) in Canada. We compared non-COVID-19 CAP and COVID-19 baseline, thrombo-inflammatory response, and mortality. We measured plasma cytokine and coagulation factor levels in a sample of patients, did hierarchical clustering, and compared cytokine and coagulation factor levels. RESULTS: In 2,485 patients (non-COVID-19 CAP, n = 719; COVID-19 patients, n = 2,157), non-COVID-19 CAP patients had significantly lower 28-day mortality (CAP vs. COVID-19 waves 1 and 2; 10% vs. 18% and 16%, respectively), intensive care unit admission (CAP vs. all waves; 15% vs. 39%, 37%, 33%, and 24%, respectively), invasive ventilation (CAP vs. waves 1, 2, and 3 patients; 11% vs. 25%, 20%, and 16%), vasopressor use (CAP 12% vs. 23%, 21%, and 18%), and renal replacement therapy use (CAP 3% vs. Omicron 7%). Complexity of hierarchical clustering aligned directly with mortality: COVID-19 wave 1 and 2 patients had six clusters at admission and higher mortality than non-COVID-19 CAP and Omicron that had three clusters at admission. Pooling all COVID-19 waves increased complexity with seven clusters on admission. CONCLUSION: Complex thrombo-inflammatory responses aligned with mortality of CAP. At a fundamental level, the human thrombo-inflammatory response to a brand new virus was \"confused\" whereas humans had eons of time to develop a more concise efficient thrombo-inflammatory host response to CAP.",
