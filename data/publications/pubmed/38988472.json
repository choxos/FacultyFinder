  "title": "Psychopharmacology Review for Eating Disorders Among Children, Adolescents, and Adults.",
  "abstract": "This article reviews the latest research on pharmacological management of eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Recent literature for both youth and adult populations obtained through a PubMed search was included. American Psychiatric Association guidelines, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, Canadian practice guidelines, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry guidelines were also included. First-line recommendations were focused on therapy because the evidence for medication management of eating disorders continues to be limited. Some limited evidence was found for antipsychotic use for AN, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and topiramate use for BN, and stimulant and topiramate use for BED. Further medication trials are needed to help with complex eating disorder presentations in adults and youth.",
