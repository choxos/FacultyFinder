  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the research progress of subtype H vessels in the occurrence and development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). METHODS: The relevant domestic and foreign literature was extensively reviewed. The histological features, biological mechanism of subtype H vessels involved in promoting of osteogenesis, and the role and application of the subtype H vessels in ONFH were summarized. RESULTS: The subtype H vessel is a newly discovered bone vessel, mainly distributed in metaphysis and subperiosteum, highly expressing endomucin and CD31. The subtype H vessel has a dense arrangement of Runx2 [+] early osteoprogenitors, collagen type Ⅰα [+] osteoblast cells, and Osterix [+] osteoprogenitors that have the ability to induce osteogenesis and angiogenesis. Factors such as platelet-derived growth factor BB, slit guidance ligand 3, hypoxia inducible factor 1α, Notch signaling pathway, and vascular endothelial growth factor are involved in the mechanism of subtype H vessels in promoting osteogenesis. CONCLUSION: Subtype H vessels play an important role in the regulation of angiogenesis and osteogenesis during bone tissue repair and reconstruction. The discovery of subtype H vessels provides new insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of osteogenesis and angiogenesis coupling. In the future, new techniques targeting the regulation of subtype H blood vessels may become a promising method for the treatment of ONFH.",
