  "title": "A New Variant of Connective Tissue Nevus with Elastorrhexis and Predilection for the Upper Chest.",
  "abstract": "Localized changes in cutaneous elastic tissue often manifest with flesh-colored, hypopigmented, or yellow papules, plaques, and nodules. We present five children with clinically similar cobblestone plaques composed of multiple hypopigmented, nonfollicular, pinpoint papules located unilaterally over the upper chest. All lesions first appeared at birth or during early infancy. No associated extracutaneous abnormalities have been identified. Histopathology was remarkable for many, thick elastic fibers with elastorrhexis. We believe that these cases represent a distinct and unique variant of connective tissue nevi.",
