  "abstract": "The role of the microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis in mood regulation and depression treatment has gained attention in recent years, as evidenced by the growing number of animal and human studies that have reported the anti-depressive and associated gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic (GABAergic) effects of probiotics developed from Lactobacillus rhamnosus bacterial strains in the gut microbiome. The depressive states attenuated by these probiotics in patients suffering from clinical depression also characterize the severe and relapse-inducing withdrawal phase of the addiction cycle, which has been found to arise from the intoxication-enabled hyperregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the body's major stress response system, and a corresponding attenuation of its main inhibitory system, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling system. Therefore, the use of probiotics in the treatment of general cases of depression provides hope for a novel therapeutic approach to withdrawal depression remediation. This review discusses potential therapeutic avenues by which probiotic application of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains can be used to restore the central GABAergic activity responsible for attenuating the depression-inducing HPA axis hyperactivity in addiction withdrawal. Also, information is provided on brain GABAergic signaling from other known GABA-producing strains of gut microbiota.",
