  "title": "CSC software corrects off-target mediated gRNA depletion in CRISPR-Cas9 essentiality screens.",
  "abstract": "Off-target effects are well established confounders of CRISPR negative selection screens that impair the identification of essential genomic loci. In particular, non-coding regulatory elements and repetitive regions are often difficult to target with specific gRNAs, effectively precluding the unbiased screening of a large portion of the genome. To address this, we developed CRISPR Specificity Correction (CSC), a computational method that corrects for the effect of off-targeting on gRNA depletion. We benchmark CSC with data from the Cancer Dependency Map and show that it significantly improves the overall sensitivity and specificity of viability screens while preserving known essentialities, particularly for genes targeted by highly promiscuous gRNAs. We believe this tool will further enable the functional annotation of the genome as it represents a robust alternative to the traditional filtering strategy of discarding unspecific guides from the analysis. CSC is an open-source software that can be seamlessly integrated into current CRISPR analysis pipelines.",
