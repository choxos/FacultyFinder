  "abstract": "To investigate the effect of different iodide intake during pregnancy and lactation on thyroid function, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) metabolites, the expression of Krüppel-like factor KLF9 (KLF9), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in brain in offspring rats. In both male and female offspring rats, serum FT3, FT4 levels and the expression of KLF9, thyroid hormone receptors (TR)α, TRβ and BDNF in the hippocampal region and cerebellum were significantly increased in 5 times higher-than-normal pregnant iodide intake (5 HI) and 10 times higher-than-normal pregnant iodide intake (10 HI) group. The median levels of DHA metabolite (17-HDoHE) and EPA metabolites (15-HEPE, 17,18-EEQ, 9-HEPE and 14,15-DiHETE) were significantly increased in 5 HI and 10 HI group of offspring rats. Serum DHA, EPA metabolites and KLF9 as well as BDNF expression in brain might be potential iodine status biomarkers to reflect brain development in offspring.",
