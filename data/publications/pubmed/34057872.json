  "abstract": "Introduction: Subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitors (SCRMs) provide continuous ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring for surveillance of known and identification of infrequent arrhythmias. SCRMs have proven to be helpful for the evaluation of unexplained symptoms and correlation with intermittent cardiac arrhythmias. Successful functioning of SCRM is dependent on accurate detection and successful transmission of the data to the device clinic. As the use of SCRM is steadily increasing, the amount of data that requires timely adjudication requires substantial resources. Newer algorithms for accurate detection and modified workflow systems have been proposed by physicians and the manufacturers to circumvent the issue of data deluge.Areas covered: This paper provides an overview of the various aspects of ambulatory rhythm monitoring with SCRMs including indications, implantation techniques, programming strategies, troubleshooting for issue of false positive and intermittent connectivity and strategies to circumvent data deluge.Expert opinion: SCRM is an invaluable technology for prolonged rhythm monitoring. The clinical benefits from SCRM hinge on accurate arrhythmia detection, reliable transmission of the data and timely adjudication for possible intervention. Further improvement in SCRM technology is needed to minimize false-positive detection, improve connectivity to the central web-based server, and devise strategies to minimize data deluge.",
