  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Parents often accompany adolescent and young adult (AYA) pediatric cancer survivors to follow-up oncology clinic visits and remain involved in their care, although little is known about their reasons for doing so. METHOD: This mixed methods (qualitative-quantitative) study of 76 mothers of AYA survivors of childhood cancer uses content analysis and logistic regression to identify and explore reasons mothers provided for coming to the visit. Demographic and treatment data are examined as potentially explanatory factors. RESULTS: Ten reasons (in decreasing order of frequency) were derived: Concern for Child's Health and Well-Being, Practical Support, Transportation, Familial Experience, General Support, Companionship, Personal Interest in Follow-up Care, Characteristics of their Child, Emotional Support, and Parental Duty. The reasons were not related to demographic or treatment factors. CONCLUSION: Mothers accompany AYAs to survivorship clinic for both maternal/family-focused and survivor-focused reasons that can be incorporated in survivorship and transition care to reflect ongoing communications among survivors, parents, and health care teams.",
