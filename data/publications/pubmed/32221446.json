  "abstract": "Aim To assess the habits of tooth wear risk assessment and charting using a tooth wear index, by UK and non-UK dental practitioners.Design A questionnaire-based evaluation.Methods Three hundred and two completed questionnaires were returned and the outcomes analysed using descriptives, Chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test in SPSS. Significance was inferred at p <0.05.Results Based on a sample of 297 responses, 81% agreed to the need to undertake risk assessment for all dental patients attending for a first-time consultation. Fifty-nine percent undertook risk assessments for 'new patients' previously identified with signs of severe tooth wear. The routine use of a clinical index to perform tooth wear charting was described by 13.5%, with 5% documenting the frequent use of the BEWE tool. While specialist dental practitioners or those with further post-graduate training were more likely to use a tooth wear index (p <0.05), there were no other significant relationships between any of the variables in the sample and the practising habits assessed.Conclusion This investigation alludes to good levels of professional awareness of tooth wear. However, the need for improvement with the actual undertaking of risk assessments for tooth wear and consistency with tooth wear assessment and charting was determined. The need for appropriate professional guidance for the undertaking of tooth wear assessments is supported by the outcomes of this investigation.",
