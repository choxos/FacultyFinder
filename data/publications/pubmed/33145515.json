  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: eCTAS is a real-time electronic decision-support tool designed to standardize the application of the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS). This study addresses the variability of CTAS score distributions across institutions pre- and post-eCTAS implementation. METHODS: We used population-based administrative data from 2016-2018 from all emergency departments (EDs) that had implemented eCTAS for 9 months. Following a 3-month stabilization period, we compared 6 months post-eCTAS data to the same 6 months the previous year (pre-eCTAS). We included triage encounters of adult (≥17 years) patients who presented with 1 of 16 pre-specified, high-volume complaints. For each ED, consistency was calculated as the absolute difference in CTAS distribution compared to the average of all included EDs for each presenting complaint. Pre-eCTAS and post-eCTAS change scores were compared using a paired-samples t-test. We also assessed if eCTAS modifiers were associated with triage consistency. RESULTS: There were 363,214 (183,231 pre-eCTAS, 179,983 post-eCTAS) triage encounters included from 35 EDs. Triage scores were more consistent (P < 0.05) post-eCTAS for 6 (37.5%) presenting complaints: chest pain (cardiac features), extremity weakness/symptoms of cerebrovascular accident, fever, shortness of breath, syncope, and hyperglycemia. Triage consistency was similar pre- and post-eCTAS for altered level of consciousness, anxiety/situational crisis, confusion, depression/suicidal/deliberate self-harm, general weakness, head injury, palpitations, seizure, substance misuse/intoxication, and vertigo. Use of eCTAS modifiers was associated with increased triage consistency. CONCLUSIONS: eCTAS increased triage consistency across many, but not all, high-volume presenting complaints. Modifier use was associated with increased triage consistency, particularly for non-specific complaints such as fever and general weakness.",
