  "title": "The effectiveness and efficiency of home-based nursing health promotion for older people: a review of the literature.",
  "abstract": "Despite the large potential role that community nurses have in providing individualized health promotion to older people, there is a lack of consensus in the literature regarding this role's effectiveness and efficiency. This article presents a literature review and synthesis of 12 randomized controlled trials selected from 344 published studies on preventive home visitation programs for older people. The findings suggest that a diversity of home visiting interventions carried out by nurses can favorably affect health and functional status, mortality rates, use of hospitalization and nursing homes, and costs. Further research is needed that focuses on the outcomes of quality of life, mental health, social support, caregiver burden, the acceptability of intervention, and specific subgroups of clients who benefit most. Findings also indicate the need for a theoretical foundation, increased emphasis on health-promotion strategies, and more research using a more complete economic evaluation to establish efficiency.",
