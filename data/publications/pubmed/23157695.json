  "title": "Cross validation of the b Test in a large known groups sample.",
  "abstract": "The b Test (Boone, Lu, & Herzberg, 2002a) is a measure of cognitive performance validity originally validated on 91 non-credible participants and 7 credible clinical comparison groups (total n = 161). The purpose of the current study was to provide cross-validation data for the b Test on a known groups sample of non-credible participants (n = 212) and credible heterogeneous neuropsychological clinic patients (n = 103). The new data showed that while the original E-score cut-off of ≥ 155 achieved excellent specificity (99%), it was associated with relatively poor sensitivity (41%). However, the cut-off could be substantially lowered to ≥82, while still maintaining adequate specificity (≥90%) and raising sensitivity to 68%. Examination of non-credible subgroups revealed that b Test sensitivity in feigned mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) was 58%, whereas in non-credible patients claiming depression and psychosis, cut-off sensitivity was 76% and 67%, respectively. These data suggest that the b Test may have a particular role in detection of non-credible cognitive symptoms associated with feigned psychiatric symptoms, and that fabricated deficits in processing speed and vigilance/visual scanning, detected by the b Test, are more prominent in feigned psychiatric presentations than in feigned mTBI. Further, b Test failures in patients with somatoform disorders were common, indicating that the b Test may have a specific use in detection of non-consciously created cognitive dysfunction associated with somatoform conditions.",
