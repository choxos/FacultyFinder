  "title": "Trends in hospital admissions and mortality among inflammatory bowel disease patients with substance use disorder: a 10-year United States nationwide analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and substance use disorder (SUD) may have worse clinical outcomes. However, data specific to the hospital admission and mortality rates among IBD patients with SUD are scarce. Our objective was to assess trends in admission, healthcare expenses, and mortality for IBD patients with SUD. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study using the National Inpatient Sample database to analyze SUD (alcohol, opioids, cocaine, and cannabis) among IBD hospitalizations from 2009 to 2019. RESULTS: A total of 132,894 hospitalizations for IBD had a secondary diagnosis of SUD. Of these patients, 75,172 (57%) were men and 57,696 (43%) were women. The IBD-SUD cohort had a longer length of stay than the non-SUD cohort (P < 0.001). The mean inpatient charges for IBD hospitalizations with SUD increased from $48,699 ± $1374 in 2009 to $62,672 ± $1528 in 2019 (P < 0.001). We found a 159.5% increase in IBD hospitalizations with SUD. The hospitalization rate increased from 3492 per 100,000 IBD hospitalizations in 2009 to 9063 per 100,000 in 2019 (P < 0.001). In-hospital mortality for IBD hospitalizations with SUD increased by 129.6% (from 250 deaths per 100,000 IBD hospitalizations in 2009 to 574 deaths per 100,000 IBD hospitalizations in 2019) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Over the last decade, there has been a rise in IBD hospitalizations with SUD. This has resulted in a longer length of stay, higher inpatient charges, and higher mortality rates. Identifying IBD patients potentially at risk for SUD by screening for anxiety, depression, pain, or other factors has become crucial.",
