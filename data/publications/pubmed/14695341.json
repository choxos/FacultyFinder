  "title": "Defining a 0.5-mb region of genomic gain on chromosome 6p22 in bladder cancer by quantitative-multiplex polymerase chain reaction.",
  "abstract": "Metaphase-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has identified recurrent regions of gain on different chromosomes in bladder cancer, including 6p22. These regions may contain activated oncogenes important in disease progression. Using quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (QM-PCR) to study DNA from 59 bladder tumors, we precisely mapped the focal region of genomic gain on 6p22. The marker STS-X64229 had copy number increases in 38 of 59 (64%) tumors and the flanking markers, RH122450 and A009N14, had copy number gains in 33 of 59 (56%) and 26 of 59 (45%) respectively. Contiguous gain was present for all three markers in 14 of 59 (24%) and for two (RH122450 and STS-X64229) in 25 of 59 (42%). The genomic distance between the markers flanking STS-X64229 is 0.5 megabases, defining the minimal region of gain on 6p22. Locus-specific interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed the increased copy numbers detected by QM-PCR. Current human genomic mapping data indicates that an oncogene, DEK, is centrally placed within this minimal region. Our findings demonstrate the power of QM-PCR to narrow the regions identified by CGH to facilitate identifying specific candidate oncogenes. This also represents the first study identifying DNA copy number increases for DEK in bladder cancer.",
