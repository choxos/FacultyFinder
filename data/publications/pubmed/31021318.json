  "title": "Distinct RanBP1 nuclear export and cargo dissociation mechanisms between fungi and animals.",
  "abstract": "Ran binding protein 1 (RanBP1) is a cytoplasmic-enriched and nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, playing important roles in nuclear transport. Much of what we know about RanBP1 is learned from fungi. Intrigued by the long-standing paradox of harboring an extra NES in animal RanBP1, we discovered utterly unexpected cargo dissociation and nuclear export mechanisms for animal RanBP1. In contrast to CRM1-RanGTP sequestration mechanism of cargo dissociation in fungi, animal RanBP1 solely sequestered RanGTP from nuclear export complexes. In fungi, RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP formed a 1:1:1 nuclear export complex; in contrast, animal RanBP1, CRM1 and RanGTP formed a 1:1:2 nuclear export complex. The key feature for the two mechanistic changes from fungi to animals was the loss of affinity between RanBP1-RanGTP and CRM1, since residues mediating their interaction in fungi were not conserved in animals. The biological significances of these different mechanisms in fungi and animals were also studied.",
