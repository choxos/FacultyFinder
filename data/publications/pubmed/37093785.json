  "title": "Characteristics of disorders of gut-brain interaction in the Japanese population in the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiological Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aims were to use Japanese data from the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiological Study (RFGES) to test the hypotheses that severity of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and psychosocial disturbance are ordered as Rome IV irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) > Rome III IBS > DGBI, not IBS > others. METHODS: Subjects were 2504 Japanese in the RFGES. We assessed DGBI/IBS diagnoses with Rome IV/III, IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) for anxiety/depression and non-GI somatic symptoms, PROMIS-10 for quality of life (QOL), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) Questionnaire, parts of Self-reported IBS Questionnaire (SIBSQ) for meal effect and stress effect, Food Frequency Questionnaire, and medication questions. KEY RESULTS: The prevalence of Rome IV DGBI was as follows; IBS-C 0.5%, IBS-D 0.8%, IBS-M 0.8%, IBS-U 0.1%, unspecified functional bowel disorder 10.7%, postprandial distress syndrome 2.2%, and epigastric pain syndrome 0.3%. Rome III IBS prevalence; IBS-C 3.0%, IBS-D 3.1%, IBS-M 2.7%, and IBS-U 0.6%. Comparison among Rome IV IBS (n = 54), Rome III IBS (n = 197), other DGBI (n = 746), others (n = 1389) revealed significant order as Rome IV IBS > Rome III IBS > other DGBI > others in IBS-SSS, anxiety/depression, activity impairment, non-GI symptoms, physical QOL, mental QOL, exacerbated symptoms by meals and perceived stress (all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: These findings support the study hypotheses. Data from Japan as a culturally homogenous country suggest Rome IV IBS is more severe and hence has more gut-brain psychobehavioral involvement than Rome III IBS.",
