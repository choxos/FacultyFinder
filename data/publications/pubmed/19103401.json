  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study is to describe the development and clinical use of Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services (RAAPS), a time-efficient screening tool to assess for multiple adolescent risk behaviors. METHOD: A retrospective chart audit was conducted to obtain descriptive data of middle school (N = 106) and alternative high school (N = 39) adolescents who completed the 17- to 18-item RAAPS questionnaire. Surveys assessed providers' evaluations of the RAAPS. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics and qualitative analysis indicated that providers using the RAAPS were able to identify risk behaviors/factors, provide counseling for these behaviors, and refer 26% of 9- to 15-year-olds and 43% of 16- to 20-year-olds for further assessment or ongoing risk counseling. In one brief clinic visit, the providers were able to address and document most risk behaviors/factors reported by the adolescents. DISCUSSION: Although psychometric analysis is needed, the RAAPS is a time efficient and comprehensive risk assessment tool. Early risk identification can assist providers in tailoring specific preventative education counseling and intervention programs that are geared to meet the specific needs of the adolescent population.",
