  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common anatomic variant associated with intermittent right-to-left shunting. Transcatheter PFO closure has been proposed to address multiple clinical conditions including stroke, transient ischemic attack, migraine, and decompression illness. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted using the GRADE approach to address 5 questions formulated by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) Guideline Panel in patient, intervention, comparator, outcome (PICO) format. Medical literature from January 2015 through May 2021 was searched. Extracted data underwent review and risk-of-bias assessment by 2 independent researchers. Pooled effect estimates were calculated. Certainty of evidence was determined for each query. RESULTS: Our search identified 2701 titles and abstracts, of which 30 met eligibility criteria and informed the technical review. Data were abstracted to address outcomes of PFO closure for patients with and without prior stroke, in comparison to antiplatelet therapy, in comparison to anticoagulation, and with various post-procedure antithrombotic regimens. CONCLUSION: In appropriately selected patients with prior stroke, transcatheter PFO closure reduces the risk of recurrent stroke more than antiplatelet therapy alone. Evidence to support PFO closure is weaker regarding older patients, anticoagulation, thrombophilia, transient ischemic attack, migraine, and decompression illness. Data from this technical review will inform the SCAI Guideline for Transcatheter Patent Foramen Ovale Closure.",
