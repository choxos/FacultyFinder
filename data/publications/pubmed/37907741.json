  "title": "SARS-CoV-2 infection engenders heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein interactions to impede translation elongation in the lungs.",
  "abstract": "Translational regulation in tissue environments during in vivo viral pathogenesis has rarely been studied due to the lack of translatomes from virus-infected tissues, although a series of translatome studies using in vitro cultured cells with viral infection have been reported. In this study, we exploited tissue-optimized ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) and severe-COVID-19 model mice to establish the first temporal translation profiles of virus and host genes in the lungs during SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Our datasets revealed not only previously unknown targets of translation regulation in infected tissues but also hitherto unreported molecular signatures that contribute to tissue pathology after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specifically, we observed gradual increases in pseudoribosomal ribonucleoprotein (RNP) interactions that partially overlapped the trails of ribosomes, being likely involved in impeding translation elongation. Contemporaneously developed ribosome heterogeneity with predominantly dysregulated 5 S rRNP association supported the malfunction of elongating ribosomes. Analyses of canonical Ribo-seq reads (ribosome footprints) highlighted two obstructive characteristics to host gene expression: ribosome stalling on codons within transmembrane domain-coding regions and compromised translation of immunity- and metabolism-related genes with upregulated transcription. Our findings collectively demonstrate that the abrogation of translation integrity may be one of the most critical factors contributing to pathogenesis after SARS-CoV-2 infection of tissues.",
