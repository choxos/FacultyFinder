  "abstract": "Although the concepts of pacing have been around for more than half a century, technological advances in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) have changed the landscape for patients in need of pacing support or sudden death prevention. Nurses encounter patients with CIEDs in all aspects of the health care setting. Because exciting CIED therapies are on the horizon, nurses must stay up-to-date to promote optimal outcomes for CIED patients. This essential guide provides nurses with a comprehensive overview of the principles of pacing and implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), as well as innovative technologies such as leadless cardiac pacemakers and subcutaneous ICDs.",
