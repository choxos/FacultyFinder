  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analysis the outcome of stereotactic nucleus lesioning for focal dystonia patients. METHODS: Twenty-three focal dystonia patients were divided into 2 groups according to etiological factor. Stereotactic nucleus lesioning was performed for 10 primary dystonia patients of group A and 13 secondary patients of group B. The change of motor function was investigated and matched between 2 groups after 6 months follow-up. RESULTS: Significant improvement of motor abilities was observed in patients of group A. The mean improvement of patients of group B was 43.8%. And the individual difference of improvement was obvious in patients of group B. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotactic nucleus lesioning displays a satisfactory therapeutic effect for patients of writer's cramp. The efficacy of nucleus lesioning for secondary focal dystonia patients depends on the extensive of brain functional lesion. A structurally normal brain is not certainly a predictor of good response to surgical treatment.",
