  "title": "Association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with acute cholangitis: a nationwide propensity-matched analysis from the United States.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has previously been linked to several disease states with an impact on patient outcomes. However, clinical evidence on the association between NAFLD and acute cholangitis (AC) remains scarce. We aimed to evaluate the potential association between NAFLD and AC. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the US National Inpatient Sample database from 2016 to 2019 to analyze primary AC hospitalizations with NAFLD compared to non-NAFLD in a 1:1 propensity-matched population. RESULTS: A total of 1550 AC patients with NAFLD were matched to 1550 AC patients without NAFLD. NAFLD had a higher association with AC when compared to patients without NAFLD, with an odds ratio of 2.33 (95% CI [1.81-3.0], P < 0.001). The length of stay was higher in NAFLD than in non-NAFLD (4 vs 3 days, P < 0.001). The median inpatient charges in NAFLD were also higher than in the non-NAFLD cohort ($36,182 vs $35,244, P < 0.001). Inpatient mortality was higher in NAFLD compared to non-NAFLD (1.6% vs 0%, P < 0.001). There was an increased prevalence of portal vein thrombosis (3.2% vs 0%), acute kidney injury (24.2% vs 17.7%), sepsis (3.2% vs 1.6%), mechanical ventilation (3.2% vs 0%), and percutaneous cholecystostomy tube insertion (3.2% vs 1.6%) in NAFLD compared to non-NAFLD (P < 0.05). NAFLD also had a higher association with acute cholecystitis, with an odds ratio of 3.70 (95% CI [3.19-4.29], P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed an association between NALFD and AC, resulting in increased length of stay, hospital charges, and inpatient mortality. Underlying NAFLD also increases acute complications of AC.",
