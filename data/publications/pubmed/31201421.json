  "title": "Evaluation of a PGP3 ELISA for surveillance of the burden of Chlamydia infection in women from Australia and Samoa.",
  "abstract": "Serological assays can be used to investigate the population burden of infection and potentially sequelae from Chlamydia. We investigated the PGP3 ELISA as a sero-epidemiological tool for infection or sub-fertility in Australian and Samoan women. The PGP3 ELISA absorbance levels were compared between groups of women with infertility, fertile, and current chlamydial infections. In the Australian groups, women with chlamydial tubal factor infertility had significantly higher absorbance levels in the PGP3 ELISA compared to fertile women (P < 0.0001), but not when compared to women with current chlamydial infection (P = 0.44). In the Samoan study, where the prevalence of chlamydial infections is much higher there were significant differences in the PGP3 ELISA absorbance levels between chlamydial sub-fertile women and fertile women (P = 0.003). There was no difference between chlamydial sub-fertile women and women with a current infection (P = 0.829). The results support that the PGP3 assay is effective for sero-epidemiological analysis of burden of infection, but not for evaluation of chlamydial pathological sequelae such as infertility.",
