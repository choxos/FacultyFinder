  "title": "Pre-Clinical Mobility Limitation (PCML) Outcomes in Rehabilitation Interventions for Middle-Aged and Older Adults: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "Individuals with pre-clinical mobility limitation (PCML) are at a high risk of future functional loss and progression to disability. The purpose of this scoping review was to provide a comprehensive understanding of PCML intervention studies in middle-aged and older adults. We present the interventions that have been tested or planned, describe how they have been conducted and reported, identify the knowledge gaps in current literature, and make recommendations about future research directions. An initial search of 2,291 articles resulted in 14 articles that met criteria for inclusion. Findings reveal that: (1) there is limited published work on PCML interventions, especially in middle-aged populations; and (2) the complexity and variety of PCML measures make it difficult to compare findings across PCML studies. Despite the diversity of measures, this review provides preliminary evidence that rehabilitation interventions on PCML help to delay or prevent disability progression.",
