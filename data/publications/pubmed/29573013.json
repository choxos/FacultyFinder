  "abstract": "AIM: To analyse nurses' perceptions of the impact of an extended transition programme on key dimensions of care delivery 1-6 years after graduation. The dimensions included decision-making, communication, care management, system integration and commitment. BACKGROUND: Health care employers in Ontario, Canada, can apply for government funding to support an extended transition programme for new graduate nurses that includes orientation and mentorship. METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was used. Nurses who participated in the transition programme were compared with nurses who did not. A survey was administered to a convenience sample of 2369 nurses. RESULTS: There were statistically significant differences between the two groups. Nurses in the transition programme had higher mean scores on the key dimensions of care delivery. Results were confirmed when controlling for length of time since graduation. CONCLUSION: Extended transition benefits new graduate nurses. It has a lasting effect over time and impacts key dimensions of care delivery. It can also enhance workforce integration and reduce turnover. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Responding to the needs of new graduate nurses has potential long-term advantages for health care organisations and can influence both quality and delivery of care.",
