  "title": "What's Your Style? Enhanced Interprofessional Communication and Practice Using the Communication Wheel.",
  "abstract": "Today's health care environment requires collaborative teams to provide safe, effective care. This study assessed the extent to which a face-to-face workshop increased nursing and premedical students' awareness of varying communication styles and their potential impact on interprofessional communication and practice. A self-assessment tool was administered before, immediately after, and 1 month after the workshop. Significant increases in familiarity working on interprofessional teams, identifying different communication styles, and ability to apply communication strategies were found immediately after and 1 month after the workshop.",
