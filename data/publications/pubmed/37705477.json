  "abstract": "Patients with tooth wear are commonly encountered in general dental practice. When indicated, restorative rehabilitation is often accompanied by a request from the patient for an aesthetic, tooth-coloured outcome. This article seeks to provide an evidence-based approach, focussing on the longevity of the materials which can be used for the restorative treatment of tooth wear, as well as their modes of failure and observed performance.",
