  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preoperative NT-proBNP has been shown to predict adverse cardiac outcomes, although recent studies suggested that postoperative NT-proBNP determination could provide additional information in patients submitted to noncardiac surgery. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic value of perioperative NT-proBNP in intermediate and high risk cardiovascular patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. METHODS: This study prospectively enrolled 145 patients aged ≥ 45 years, with at least one Revised Cardiac Risk Index risk factor and submitted to intermediate or high risk noncardiac surgery. NT-proBNP levels were measured pre- and postoperatively. Short-term cardiac outcome predictors were evaluated by logistic regression models. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 29 days, 17 patients (11.7%) experienced major adverse cardiac events (MACE- 14 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 2 nonfatal cardiac arrests and 3 cardiac deaths). The optimum discriminatory threshold levels for pre- and postoperative NT-proBNP were 917 and 2962 pg/mL, respectively. Pre- and postoperative NT-proBNP (OR 4.7; 95% CI 1.62-13.73; p=0.005 and OR 4.5; 95% CI 1.53-13.16; p=0.006) were significantly associated with MACE. Preoperative NT-proBNP was significantly and independently associated with adverse cardiac events in multivariate regression analysis (adjusted OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.38-12.62; p=0.011). CONCLUSION: NT-proBNP is a powerful short-term marker of perioperative cardiovascular events in high risk patients. Postoperative levels were less informative than preoperative levels. A single preoperative NT-proBNP measurement should be considered in the preoperative risk assessment.",
