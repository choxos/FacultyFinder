  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Increased wait times for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) are a concern nationally and provincially. Additionally, the number of patients requiring revision of their initial TJA is increasing. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the wait times and impact of waiting for revision TJA. METHODS: We followed 127 revision hip arthroplasty patients (mean age 68 y) prospectively while they waited for surgery. We collected Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (pain, stiffness and physical function) data at the decision for surgery and at 6-month intervals until surgery. RESULTS: The mean wait time for surgery was 123.8 days (mean wait times for individual surgeons ranged from 7 to 213 d). Of the patients, 106 waited < 6 months, 12 waited 6-12 months and 9 waited > 12 months. Wait times evaluated up to 6 months, 6-12 months or > 12 months demonstrated significant increases in pain (F = 7.12, p = 0.01), with a mean change of 2.6 points when patients waited > 6 months. Physical disability increased (F = 4.61, p = 0.01), with a mean change of 5.1 points when the wait time was 6-12 months and 8.8 points when the wait time was > 12 months. CONCLUSION: Waiting > 6 months for revision hip arthroplasty resulted in significant increases in pain and physical disability.",
