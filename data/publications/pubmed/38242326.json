  "title": "A novel treatment strategy utilizing panobinostat for high-risk and treatment-refractory hepatoblastoma.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with metastatic, treatment-refractory, and relapsed hepatoblastoma (HB) have survival rates of less than 50% due to limited treatment options. To develop new therapeutic strategies for these patients, our laboratory has developed a preclinical testing pipeline. Given that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibition has been proposed for HB, we hypothesized that we could find an effective combination treatment strategy utilizing HDAC inhibition. METHODS: RNA sequencing, microarray, NanoString, and immunohistochemistry data of patient HB samples were analyzed for HDAC class expression. Patient-derived spheroids (PDSp) were used to screen combination chemotherapy with an HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models were developed and treated with the combination therapy that showed the highest efficacy in the PDSp drug screen. RESULTS: HDAC RNA and protein expression were elevated in HB tumors compared to normal livers. Panobinostat (IC50 of 0.013-0.059 μM) showed strong in vitro effects and was associated with lower cell viability than other HDAC inhibitors. PDSp demonstrated the highest level of cell death with combination treatment of vincristine/irinotecan/panobinostat (VIP). All four models responded to VIP therapy with a decrease in tumor size compared to placebo. After 6 weeks of treatment, two models demonstrated necrotic cell death, with lower Ki67 expression, decreased serum alpha fetoprotein and reduced tumor burden compared to paired VI- and placebo-treated groups. CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a preclinical HB pipeline, we demonstrate that panobinostat in combination with VI chemotherapy can induce an effective tumor response in models developed from patients with high-risk, relapsed, and treatment-refractory HB. IMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Patients with treatment-refractory hepatoblastoma have limited treatment options with survival rates of less than 50%. Our manuscript demonstrates that combination therapy with vincristine, irinotecan, and panobinostat reduces the size of high-risk, relapsed, and treatment-refractory tumors. With this work we provide preclinical evidence to support utilizing this combination therapy as an arm in future clinical trials.",
