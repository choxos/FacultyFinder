  "abstract": "Significant strides have been made in the treatment of childhood cancer. Improvements in survival have led to increased attention toward supportive care indications; including the use of traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM). The use of T&CM among children and adolescents with cancer is well documented in both high-income countries (HICs) and low-middle income countries (LMICs). A higher incidence of the use of T&CM has been reported among children undergoing treatment in LMICs, which has elevated concerns related to drug interactions, adherence to therapy, and treatment-related toxicities. These observations have underscored the need for effective models of integrative care that are culturally sensitive yet sustainable in an LMIC setting. We present considerations inclusive of the clinical care, educational opportunities, governmental policy, and research priorities necessary for the development of models of integrative care for pediatric cancer units in an LMIC setting.",
