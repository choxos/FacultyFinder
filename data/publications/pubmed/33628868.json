  "title": "The Complexity of Living with Diabetes and Urinary Incontinence for Older Adults with Multiple Chronic Conditions Receiving Home Care Services: An Interpretive Description Study.",
  "abstract": "Over 40% of older adults with diabetes receiving home-care services experience urinary incontinence. However, experiential knowledge is lacking on how these older adults live with diabetes and incontinence. Interpretive description methodology was used to explore the experiences of 18 older adults with diabetes and urinary incontinence receiving home-care services in Ontario, Canada. Five themes emerged from the findings: (a) enduring urinary incontinence: \"patch it in pads\"; (b) struggling to manage diabetes, incontinence, and multiple chronic conditions: \"a balancing act\"; (c) covering the costs of care: \"I can't afford it\"; (d) counting on a caregiver: \"he does everything\"; and (e) home-care services not meeting my needs: \"it's not individual.\" These findings suggest that living with urinary incontinence and diabetes is a complex and challenging experience. This evidence could inform the provision of comprehensive home care to support self-care for this population.",
