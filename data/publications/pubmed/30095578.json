  "abstract": "OBJETIVES: The aim of the study is to investigate the incidence and clinical features of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in children from the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, for 10 years. METHODS: From the records of all of the pediatric hepatologists in the province of Santa Fe, Argentina, we reviewed the clinical charts of patients <18 years who were diagnosed with AIH (simplified score >6 points) and followed between January 2003 and December 2013. Population data were extracted from the 2010 national census. Values were expressed as percentages and median ± interquartile range. Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparison between the groups. RESULTS: Sixty-seven patients fulfilled inclusion criteria, from which 11 (16%) were later reclassified as having \"autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis\" according to biochemical, histological, and radiological findings. A final sample of 56 patients (39 F) with AIH was analyzed, giving an annual incidence of 0.56/100,000. Median age at presentation was 8 (5.7-11) years, and the median follow-up was 4 (2-7) years. Type 1 AIH was diagnosed in 89%. An acute presentation was observed in 53%, while 13 (23%) showed cirrhosis on initial biopsy. Prednisone (87%) and azathioprine (60%) were the most common drugs prescribed. At the end of follow-up, 53/56 (95%) were alive, including 4 patients (7%) who underwent liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: AIH has an estimated incidence of 0.56/100,000 per year in children from the province of Santa Fe (Argentina). Overall survival rate was 95%. A subgroup of patients diagnosed as AIH develops predominant biliary disease and should be better classified as autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis.",
