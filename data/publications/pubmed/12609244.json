  "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms in children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, explore the course of these symptoms over time, and examine factors associated with change in these symptoms. Parents of children (n=42) were administered the Attention Deficit Disorder Evaluation Scale-Home Version (ADDES-HV) at the time of diagnosis. The ADDES-HV was readministered after the child's seizures were controlled. Prior to initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, 31% of the children were rated as having clinically significant problems with inattention and 31% with hyperactivity-impulsivity. At follow-up, 27% had elevated symptoms of inattention and 24% had hyperactivity-impulsivity. Analysis of this change indicated that children with a normal MRI were more likely to have decreased hyperactive-impulsive behaviors following control of their seizures. Results suggest the need for assessment and monitoring of attention in children with epilepsy.",
