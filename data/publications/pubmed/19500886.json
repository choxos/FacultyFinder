  "title": "Simulated experiences: nursing students share their perspectives.",
  "abstract": "In an attempt to address a shortage of clinical nursing placements, the rising complexity of care and to increase preparedness of students entering clinical settings, the provincial government of Ontario invested significant funding for the purchase of simulation equipment in undergraduate Schools of Nursing. What students believe about simulation and learning can influence how it is used and can also provide faculty with a better understanding of how it can best be implemented. This study explored nursing students' viewpoints about the use of simulation in their nursing programs. Q-methodology was the research approach used. In total, 24 students from 17 universities and colleges participated in the study. Although all students felt that simulated experiences could support learning overall, four groups of students were identified who had differing viewpoints. Described as reflectors, reality skeptics, comfort seekers, and technology savvies, these four groups of students require unique approaches to better engage them in learning with simulation. This study provides recommendations for faculty to consider, taking into account these varied viewpoints regarding simulation in nursing education.",
