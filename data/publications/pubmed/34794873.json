  "title": "Polycythaemia Vera and Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery: A Systematic Review of the Literature.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Polycythaemia vera (PV) is a condition that may potentially put patients undergoing cardiac surgery at an increased risk of bleeding and thrombosis; however, there is currently a paucity of literature regarding the management of these patients. We aim to examine the literature in this systematic review to indicate the interventions that may be considered to minimise complications. METHODS: We conducted a literature search using keywords and MeSH terms to identify articles discussing PV and cardiac surgery. The studies were identified and qualitatively analysed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol. RESULTS: In total, 10 case reports representing 11 patients were identified for this systematic review and were included in qualitative analysis. 63.6% of patients had preoperative intermittent phlebotomy, and the majority of patients received postoperative therapy that involved one antiplatelet agent and one anticoagulant. Generous perioperative fluid management, phlebotomy, preservation of core body temperature, early extubation, monitoring of myocardial ischaemia, infarction and vascular events, intense chest physiotherapy and patient mobilisation are important to consider to reduce the risk of complications arising from surgery. CONCLUSION: These considerations should be systematically discussed in a multidisciplinary team, where the acute surgical need can be balanced appropriately against the risk of haemorrhage and thrombosis.",
