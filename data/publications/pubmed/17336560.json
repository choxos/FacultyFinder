  "abstract": "Myogenin is a bHLH transcription factor of the MyoD family. It plays a crucial role in myoblast differentiation and maturation. We report here the isolation of flounder myogenin gene and the characterization of its expression patterns. Sequence analysis indicated that flounder myogenin shared a similar structure and the conserved bHLH domain with other vertebrate myogenin genes. Flounder myogenin gene contains 3 exons and 2 introns. Sequence alignment and phylogenetic showed that flounder myogenin was more homologous with halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) myogenin and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) myogenin. Whole-mount embryo in situ hybridization revealed that flounder myogenin was first detected in the medial region of somites that give rise to slow muscles, and expanded later to the lateral region of the somite that become fast muscles. The levels of myogenin transcripts dropped significantly in matured somites at the trunk region. Its expression could only be detected in the caudal somites, which was consistent with the timing of somite maturation. Transient expression analysis showed that the 546 bp flounder myogenin promoter was sufficient to direct muscle-specific GFP expression in zebrafish embryos.",
