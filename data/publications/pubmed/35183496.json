  "title": "Surgical Therapy in Patients With Medication-Related Osteonecrosis of the Jaw Is Associated With Disease Resolution and Improved Quality of Life: A Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Although recent evidence has suggested the value of operative therapy for the management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), its effectiveness remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to measure and compare MRONJ disease resolution and changes to the quality of life (QoL) between operative and nonoperative management of MRONJ. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study. Consecutive MRONJ patients presenting to Mount Sinai Hospital and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center (September 2016 to August 2020) were recruited and divided by the treatments provided into operative and nonoperative groups. The primary and secondary outcome variables were disease resolution and QoL at 6 months, respectively. Disease resolution was defined as mucosal coverage with an absence of pain, and QoL was measured via the MRONJ-QoL questionnaire. The primary and secondary outcomes, after adjusting for potential confounders, were assessed via multivariate logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses, respectively, with significance set to P < .05. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in this study. Of these, 40 patients received operative treatment, and 20 received nonoperative treatment. In the unadjusted analyses, operative therapy was found to be significantly associated with both disease resolution and improvement in QoL (relative risk 6.75, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78 to 25.6, P < .001; and MRONJ-QoL score improvement of 3.35, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.54, P = .04). When controlling for potential confounders, operative therapy was found to be significantly associated with disease resolution when compared with nonoperative therapy (adjusted odds ratio 46.2, 95% CI 5.57 to 383.9, P < .001). Linear regression analysis also showed operative therapy to be significantly associated with improved QoL compared with nonoperative therapy (adjusted MRONJ-QoL score improvement of 3.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 7.11, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated operative therapy to be significantly associated with disease resolution and improvement in QoL.",
