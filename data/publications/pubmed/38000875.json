  "title": "Large language models and their impact in ophthalmology.",
  "abstract": "The advent of generative artificial intelligence and large language models has ushered in transformative applications within medicine. Specifically in ophthalmology, large language models offer unique opportunities to revolutionise digital eye care, address clinical workflow inefficiencies, and enhance patient experiences across diverse global eye care landscapes. Yet alongside these prospects lie tangible and ethical challenges, encompassing data privacy, security, and the intricacies of embedding large language models into clinical routines. This Viewpoint highlights the promising applications of large language models in ophthalmology, while weighing up the practical and ethical barriers towards their real-world implementation. This Viewpoint seeks to stimulate broader discourse on the potential of large language models in ophthalmology and to galvanise both clinicians and researchers into tackling the prevailing challenges and optimising the benefits of large language models while curtailing the associated risks.",
