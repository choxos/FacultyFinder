  "title": "Postoperative Rehabilitation May Reduce the Risk of Readmission After Groin Hernia Repair.",
  "abstract": "Thirty-day readmission after surgery has been proposed as a quality-of-care indicator. We explored the effect of postoperative rehabilitation on readmission risk after groin hernia repair. We used the French National Discharge Database to identify all index hospitalizations for groin hernia repair in 2011. Readmissions within 30 days of discharge were clinically classified in terms of their relationship to the index stay. We used logistic regression to adjust the risk of readmission for patient, procedure and hospital factors. Among 122,952 index hospitalizations for inguinal hernia repair, 3,357 (2.7%) related 30-day readmissions were recorded. Reiterated analyses indicated that readmission risk was consistently associated with patient complexity: age (per year after 60 years, OR 1.03, 95% CI 1.02-1.03, P < 0.001), hospitalization within the previous year (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.44-1.69, P < 0.001), and increasing severity and combination of co-morbidities. Postoperative rehabilitation was identified as a protective factor (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.46-0.69, P < 0.001). Older patients and those with greater comorbidity are at elevated risk of readmission after inguinal hernia repair. Postoperative rehabilitation may reduce this risk. Further studies are warranted to confirm the protective effect of postoperative rehabilitation.",
