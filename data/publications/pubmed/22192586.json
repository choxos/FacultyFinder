  "abstract": "Photocatalytic activity of nitrogen modified TiO(2) calcined at temperatures of 100-350°C toward 3-chlorophenol (3-CP) degradation was studied. In the experiments the fluorescent UV lamp and the incandescent lamp emitting mainly Vis light were applied. The degradation efficiency was evaluated on a basis of changes of 3-CP, total organic carbon and Cl(-) concentration. A significant improvement of the photoactivity of the N-modified photocatalysts compared to the reference sample was observed. The rate of 3-CP degradation increased with the calcination temperature, and the highest efficiency was achieved for TiO(2) annealed at 350°C. After 5h of UV irradiation in the presence of TiO(2)/N-350 and reference TiO(2) the 3-CP concentration decreased for 77% and 36%, respectively. The 3-CP removal after 24h of Vis irradiation was 30% and 12% for the N-modified and reference samples, respectively. The 3-CP decomposition and mineralization were greatly influenced by pH of the solution, achieving the highest rate at pH 7 for the modified photocatalysts. An increase of the calcination temperature resulted in an increase of the rate of OH formation. The photocatalytic activity of the N-modified TiO(2) remained unchanged during repeated photocatalytic degradation cycles.",
