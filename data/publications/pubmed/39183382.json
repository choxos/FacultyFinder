  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Early adolescents who are new to Canada experience dual challenges of navigating developmental changes and multiple cultures. This study examined how changes in early adolescents' emotional health from ages 9 to 12 differed by immigration background, and to what extent peer belonging and supportive school climate protected or promoted their emotional health. METHODS: This study drew upon linked self-report and administrative data. Across 10 school districts in British Columbia, Canada, N = 4479 non-immigrant, immigrant, and refugee adolescents reported on their peer belonging, school climate, and emotional health (life satisfaction, optimism, self-esteem, sadness, worries) in Grades 4 and 7, using the Middle Years Development Instrument. Immigration background including immigration class (economic, family, refugee) and generation status (first, second) were obtained from linked Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada data. Multi-level modeling assessed the effect of time (grade level), immigration group, and changes in peer belonging and school climate on changes in self-reported emotional health. Analyses were adjusted for gender, English first language, and low family income. RESULTS: Immigrant and refugee adolescents reported worse emotional health in Grade 4 compared to non-immigrants. Non-immigrant and immigrant adolescents reported declines in emotional health from Grades 4 to 7. In contrast, first-generation refugee adolescents reported significant improvements in life satisfaction, and first- and second-generation refugees reported improvements in worries over this period. Perceived improvements in peer belonging and school climate were associated with positive changes in emotional health for all adolescents. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in adolescents' emotional health from Grades 4 to 7 differed between immigrants, refugees, and non-immigrants. Immigrants and refugees who enter adolescence with lower emotional health than their non-immigrant peers may particularly benefit from culturally responsive school and community-based interventions.",
