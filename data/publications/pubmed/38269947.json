  "title": "Reshaping Wound Care: Evaluation of an Artificial Intelligence App to Improve Wound Assessment and Management.",
  "abstract": "This study evaluated the usability and effectiveness of an artificial intelligence application for wound assessment and management from a clinician-and-patient perspective. A quasi-experimental design was conducted in four settings in an Australian health service. Data were collected from patients in the standard (n=166,243 wounds) and intervention (n=124,184 wounds) group, at baseline and post-intervention. Clinicians completed a survey (n=10) and focus group (n=13) and patients were interviewed (n=4). Wound documentation were analysed descriptively, bivariate statistics determined between-group differences, and interviews were thematically analysed. Compared with the standard group, wound documentation in the intervention group improved significantly (<2 items documented 24% vs 70%, P < .001). During the intervention, 101/132 wounds improved (mean wound size reduction=53.99%). Positive evaluations included instantaneous objective wound assessment, shared wound plans increased patient adherence and enhanced efficiency in providing virtual care. Application use facilitated remote patient monitoring and reduced patient travel time while maintaining optimal wound care.",
