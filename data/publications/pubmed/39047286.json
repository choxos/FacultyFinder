  "title": "Centralized Pump Monitoring System: Perception on Utility and Workflows by Nurses in a Tertiary Hospital.",
  "abstract": "Nurses play a key role in providing in-hospital care to patients. Worldwide, there has been a shortage of nursing staff, putting enormous strain on the existing nursing workforce physically and mentally. A vicious cycle of demanding workplaces exacerbated by perennial shortages leads to attrition and high staff turnover. A centralized, automated infusion pump monitoring system optimizes and augments nurses' performance in the hospital by cutting down on nurse visits to the patient's bedside for every matter, whether significant or insignificant. This viewpoint intends to highlight that by filtering out the noise effectively, nurses can focus on improving patient outcome-led interventions and enhancing the quality of care.",
