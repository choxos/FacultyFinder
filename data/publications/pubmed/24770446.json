  "title": "Involvement of myosin regulatory light chain diphosphorylation in sustained vasoconstriction under pathophysiological conditions.",
  "abstract": "Smooth muscle contraction is activated primarily by phosphorylation at Ser19 of the regulatory light chain subunits (LC20) of myosin II, catalysed by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent myosin light chain kinase. Ca(2+)-independent contraction can be induced by inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase, which correlates with diphosphorylation of LC20 at Ser19 and Thr18, catalysed by integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK). LC20 diphosphorylation at Ser19 and Thr18 has been detected in mammalian vascular smooth muscle tissues in response to specific contractile stimuli (e.g. endothelin-1 stimulation of rat renal afferent arterioles) and in pathophysiological situations associated with hypercontractility (e.g. cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage). Comparison of the effects of LC 20 monophosphorylation at Ser19 and diphosphorylation at Ser19 and Thr18 on contraction and relaxation of Triton-skinned rat caudal arterial smooth muscle revealed that phosphorylation at Thr18 has no effect on steady-state force induced by Ser19 phosphorylation. On the other hand, the rates of dephosphorylation and relaxation are significantly slower following diphosphorylation at Thr18 and Ser19 compared to monophosphorylation at Ser19. We propose that this diphosphorylation mechanism underlies the prolonged contractile response of particular vascular smooth muscle tissues to specific stimuli, e.g. endothelin-1 stimulation of renal afferent arterioles, and the vasospastic behavior observed in pathological conditions such as cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage and coronary arterial vasospasm. ILK and ZIPK may, therefore, be useful therapeutic targets for the treatment of such conditions.",
