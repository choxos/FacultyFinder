  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective cross-sectional case-control study was to evaluate an alternative imaging test for lateralization of the tibial tuberosity, unbiased towards knee rotation. METHODS: On axial CT images of 129 knees, classified as cases (two or more patellar luxations) and controls (no patellar luxations), two raters gauged the standard tibial tuberosity-trochlear groove (TT-TG) distance, tibial tuberosity-femoral intercondylar midpoint (TT-FIM) distance, and new tibial tuberosity-tibial intercondylar midpoint (TT-TIM) distance singly, and knee longitudinal rotation angles (LRAs), and the presence of femoral trochlear dysplasia (FTD) jointly. RESULTS: All imaging tests intercorrelated and discriminated between stability groups. TT-TIM had the lowest values with the highest precision. Though poorly, TT-TG and TT-FIM negatively correlated with age and LRAs regarding femur, but positively with presence of FTD, whereas TT-TIM was unbiased. The accuracy of TT-TG (> 20 mm), TT-FIM (> 20 mm), and TT-TIM (> 13 mm) was good with almost perfect reproducibility. Only TT-TIM was sex-biased (p = 0.009), with > 12 mm cut-off in females and (presumably) > 14 mm in males. CONCLUSION: TT-TIM is an alternative imaging test for lateralization of the tibial tuberosity, unbiased towards knee rotation.",
