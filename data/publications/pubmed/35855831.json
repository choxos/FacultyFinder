  "title": "Mechanism of Cornus Officinalis in Treating Diabetic Kidney Disease Based on Network Pharmacology.",
  "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD), one of the most important diabetic complications, is a great clinical challenge. It still lacks proper therapeutic strategies without side effects due to the complex pathological mechanisms. Cornus officinalis (CO) is a common traditional Chinese medicine, which has been used in the treatment of DKD and takes beneficial effects in therapy. However, the mechanism of CO in treating DKD is not clear yet. In this study, network pharmacology was applied to illustrate the potential mechanism of CO and the interaction between targets of CO and targets of disease. First, the active ingredients of CO and related targets were screened from the online database. Second, the intersection network between CO and disease was constructed, and protein-protein interaction analysis was done. Third, GO and KEGG analysis were employed to figure out the key targets of CO. Finally, molecular docking was carried out in the software SYBYL to verify the effectiveness of the ingredients and targets selected. According to GO and KEGG analysis, drug metabolism-cytochrome P450, sphingolipid signaling pathway, HIF-1 signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, cGMP-PKG signaling pathway, estrogen signaling pathway, and TNF signaling pathway were most closely related to the pathogenesis of DKD. Moreover, NOS3, TNF, ROCK1, PPARG, KDR, and HIF1A were identified as key targets in regulating the occurrence and development of the disease. This study provides evidence to elucidate the mechanism of CO comprehensively and systematically and lays the foundation for further research on CO.",
