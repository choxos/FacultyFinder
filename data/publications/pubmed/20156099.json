  "abstract": "Abstract Human plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) are the major producers of type I interferons (IFN) after stimulation with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). HIV-1-infected patients show a deficit in PDC numbers and function with progression of disease. CpG ODN appear to be attractive therapeutics to support the impaired innate immunity in HIV-1 infection. PDC counts, phenotype, and function were analyzed in 23 HIV-infected untreated individuals and 16 controls. Markers for migration (CCR7), activation (CD80), maturation (CD83), and endocytosis (BDCA2) were evaluated at baseline and 20 h after in vitro stimulation with class A, B, C, and P ODN. PDC counts and the expression of BDCA2 on these cells were significantly lower in HIV-1-infected subjects compared to controls (both p < 0.001). After stimulation with CpG ODN, CD80 and CD83 were upregulated to a similar extent in patients and controls, whereas CCR7 was upregulated more efficiently by CpG-P and CpG-C than CpG-A in HIV-1-infected individuals compared to controls. The IFN-alpha induction significantly differed for the CpG ODN classes (A > P > C > B) in patients and controls (p < 0.05). Functional PDC deficits in IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha induction were particularly evident in subjects with less than 500 CD4(+) cells/mul. CpG-P ODNs not only induced remarkable IFN-alpha production in patient PBMCs, but also significantly upregulated the antibacterial and antiviral CXC chemokine IP-10. In conclusion, PDC counts, phenotype, and function are significantly impaired in HIV-1-infected subjects. Optimized P-class ODN may be effective in reversing this innate immune defect, which should be further evaluated in vivo.",
