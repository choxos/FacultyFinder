  "abstract": "Type 1 endoleak of common iliac artery (type I(b) endoleak) should be treated during endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). An 86-year-old female was diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring 6.6 cm in diameter and right internal iliac artery aneurysm measuring 4.0 cm in diameter. She underwent EVAR after right internal iliac artery embolization. There was type I(b) endoleak, which was repaired by balloon-expandable stent, Palmaz XL stent (Cordis). We report successful treatment of type I(b) endoleak with Palmaz XL stent, which may be considered as an alternative option for type I(b) endoleak after EVAR.",
