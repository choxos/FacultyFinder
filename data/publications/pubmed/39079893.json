  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Hypocomplementaemia is common in patients with IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD). We aimed to determine the IgG4-RD features associated with hypocomplementaemia and investigate mechanisms of complement activation in this disease. METHODS: We performed a single-centre cross-sectional study of 279 patients who fulfilled the IgG4-RD classification criteria, using unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted logistic regression to identify factors associated with hypocomplementaemia. RESULTS: Hypocomplementaemia was observed in 90 (32%) patients. In the unadjusted model, the number of organs involved (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.63) and involvement of the lymph nodes (OR 3.87, 95% CI 2.19 to 6.86), lungs (OR 3.81, 95% CI 2.10 to 6.89), pancreas (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.001 to 2.76), liver (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.17 to 6.36) and kidneys (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.18) were each associated with hypocomplementaemia. After adjusting for age, sex and number of organs involved, only lymph node (OR 2.59, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.91) and lung (OR 2.56, 95% CI 1.35 to 4.89) involvement remained associated with hypocomplementaemia while the association with renal involvement was attenuated (OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.98). Fibrotic disease manifestations (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.87) and lacrimal gland involvement (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.999) were inversely associated with hypocomplementaemia in the adjusted analysis. Hypocomplementaemia was associated with higher concentrations of all IgG subclasses and IgE (all p<0.05). After adjusting for serum IgG1 and IgG3, only IgG1 but not IgG4 remained strongly associated with hypocomplementaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Hypocomplementaemia in IgG4-RD is not unique to patients with renal involvement and may reflect the extent of disease. IgG1 independently correlates with hypocomplementaemia in IgG4-RD, but IgG4 does not. Complement activation is likely involved in IgG4-RD pathophysiology.",
