  "title": "A cosmesis outcome substudy in a prospective, randomized trial comparing radioguided seed localization with standard wire localization for nonpalpable, invasive, and in situ breast carcinomas.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The primary study objective was to compare the cosmetic result of radioguided seed localization (RSL) with wire localization (WL). METHODS: A subgroup of patients enrolled in a multicentered, randomized trial comparing WL with RSL participated. Frontal photographs were taken 1 and 3Â years postsurgery. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Cosmetic Rating System was used to evaluate cosmesis outcomes by the patient and a panel of 5 raters. RESULTS: The study enrolled 73 patients (WL, n = 38; RSL, n = 35). Most patients rated their overall cosmesis as \"excellent\" or \"good\" (76% WL, 80% RSL). Patient and panel ratings on all cosmetic outcomes were similar between groups. Multivariable regression for overall cosmesis found larger specimen volume and reoperation to be predictors of worse ratings. CONCLUSIONS: All cosmetic outcomes assessed were similar after WL and RSL. The comparable outcomes may reflect similar reoperation rates and volumes of excision between groups.",
