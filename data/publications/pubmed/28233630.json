  "title": "Practice variation in the re-initiation of dofetilide: An observational study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has been reported to be safe and efficacious in the treatment of atrial dysrhythmias with a known initial risk of QT prolongation and torsades de pointes (TdP). As a result, the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) mandated in-hospital dofetilide initiation and adherence to a common dosing protocol. However, there is a lack of clarity on how to manage dofetilide re-initiation. METHODS: An observational survey was performed including 347 cardiologists in the United States and worldwide to evaluate the deviations from approved manufacturer's protocol during dofetilide initiation and re-initiation among practicing cardiologists. RESULTS: Most practicing cardiologists were cautious about outpatient dofetilide use and adhered to the manufacturer's in-patient dofetilide protocol during de-novo initiation and reported low incidence of TdP in clinical practice. There were substantial differences among practicing cardiologists with deviation from the manufacturer's protocol during re-initiation of dofetilide. About 21% cardiologists always admitted patients to the hospital while 37% admitted patients <10% of the time for dofetilide re-initiation. Only 4% reported major adverse events with outpatient dofetilide re-initiation. There was also wide variation regarding monitoring of electrolytes and QT interval as an outpatient with dofetilide. CONCLUSION: There is significant practice pattern variation in the use of dofetilide for the management of AF. This degree of variation noted is concerning and is a reflection of the current lack of substantial clinical evidence in the re-initiation dofetilide protocol to help direct the provider.",
