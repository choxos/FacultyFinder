  "title": "Evaluating equity of access and predictors of minimally invasive hysterectomy for endometrial and cervical cancer from 2000 to 2017 in Ontario, Canada: A population-based cohort study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We sought to assess the uptake of minimally invasive hysterectomy among patients with endometrial and cervical cancer in Ontario, Canada, and assess the equity of access to minimally invasive surgery (MIS) by evaluating associations with patient, disease, institutional, and provider factors. METHODS: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study of hysterectomy for endometrial and cervical cancer in Ontario (2000-2017). Surgical approach, clinicopathologic, sociodemographic, institutional, and provider factors were identified through administrative databases. Fisher's exact, χ[2] , Wilcoxon rank sum, logistic regression, and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to explore factors associated with MIS. RESULTS: A total of 27 652 patients were included. In total, 6199/24 264 (26%) endometrial and 842/3388 (25%) cervical cancer patients received MIS. The proportion of MIS to open surgeries increased from <0.1% in 2000 to over 55% in 2017 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.31, confidence interval [CI] = 1.28-1.34). Low-income quintile, rurality, low hospital volume, nonacademic hospital, nongynecologic oncology surgeon, and earlier year of surgeon graduation were associated with reduced odds of MIS (OR < 1). CONCLUSIONS: The uptake of MIS hysterectomy increased steadily over the time period. Receipt of MIS is dependent upon multiple social determinants, provider variables, and systems factors. These disparities raise concern for health equity in Ontario and have significant implications for health systems planning and resource allocation.",
