  "title": "Paper-based dosing algorithms for maintenance of warfarin anticoagulation.",
  "abstract": "We examined the quality of anticoagulation produced by two paper-based warfarin dosing algorithms in a randomized clinical trial of warfarin therapy. Fifty-eight patients were randomized to receive warfarin at a target international normalized ratio (INR) range of 2.1-3.0 and were followed for an average of 2.7 years. As a proportion of total patient-time, the percentage of time spent above, within, and below the therapeutic range was 11%, 71%, and 19% respectively. Fifty-six patients were randomized to receive warfarin at a higher target INR range (3.1-4.0) and had INRs within the therapeutic range for 40% of total patient time. We conclude that the performance, minimal cost, and ease-of-use of these algorithms make them well-suited for patient management within primary-care and research settings.",
