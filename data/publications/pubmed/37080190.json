  "title": "Anticoagulation use in perioperative atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perioperative atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, and death after noncardiac surgery. Anticoagulation therapy is effective for stroke prevention in nonsurgical atrial fibrillation, but its efficacy and safety in perioperative atrial fibrillation are unknown. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL from database inception until January 2022. We included studies comparing anticoagulation versus no anticoagulation use in patients with perioperative atrial fibrillation after noncardiac surgery. Our study outcomes included stroke ± systemic embolism, bleeding, mortality, myocardial infarction, and venous thromboembolism. We pooled studies using fixed-effects models. We reported summary risk ratios (RRs) for studies reporting multivariable-adjusted results. RESULTS: Seven observational studies but no randomised trials were included. Of the 27,822 patients, 29.1% were prescribed therapeutic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation use was associated with a lower risk of stroke ± systemic embolism (RR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.62-0.85; I2 = 81%; 3 studies) but a higher risk of bleeding (RR 1.14; 95% CI, 1.04-1.25; 1 study). There was a lower risk of mortality associated with anticoagulation use (RR 0.45; 95% CI, 0.40-0.51; I2 = 80%; 2 studies). There was no difference in the risk of myocardial infarction (RR 2.19; 95% CI, 0.97-4.96; 1 study). The certainty of the evidence was very low across all outcomes. CONCLUSION: Anticoagulation is associated with a reduced risk of stroke and death but an increased risk of bleeding. The quality of the evidence is very poor. Randomised trials are needed to better determine the effects of anticoagulation use in this population.",
