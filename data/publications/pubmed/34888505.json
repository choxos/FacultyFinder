  "title": "The Association of Atrial Fibrillation Before Percutaneous Coronary Intervention With 1-Year Outcome in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Patients.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the association of atrial fibrillation (AF) with 1-year outcome in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS: Patients (n = 8830) enrolled in the Trial of Routine Aspiration Thrombectomy with PCI vs PCI Alone in Patients With STEMI (TOTAL) were followed for 1 year. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, or new or worsening class IV heart failure. The presence or absence of AF was determined from a single pre-PCI electrocardiogram. RESULTS: Patients with AF (n = 437; 4.9%) were older, and more often had a history of stroke, hypertension, or myocardial infarction. The rate of the primary outcome was higher in the AF group than in the sinus rhythm (SR) group (17.4% vs 7.4%, P < 0.001), as was the rate of cardiovascular death (9.8% vs 3.3%, P < 0.001). In multivariable analysis, AF was independently predictive of the primary outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-2.16, P < 0.001), cardiovascular death (aHR 1.69; 95% CI, 1.19-2.40, P = 0.003), all-cause mortality (aHR 1.63; 95% CI, 1.18-2.24, P = 0.003), and severe heart failure (aHR 1.96; 95% CI, 1.25-3.07, P = 0.003). Among patients who were in SR, the primary outcome occurred in 307 of 4252 (7.2%) in the thrombectomy group and 310 of 4141 (7.5%) in the PCI alone group, and among those with AF, these rates were respectively 42 of 218 (19.3%) and 34 of 219 (15.5%) (P interaction = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients, AF on the pre-PCI electrocardiogram is associated with a higher risk of the primary composite cardiovascular outcome, all-cause and cardiovascular death, and severe heart failure during 1-year follow-up than it is in patients with SR.",
