  "title": "Low quality cardiovascular care is important coronary risk factor in India.",
  "abstract": "Global Burden of Disease study has reported that cardiovascular and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality has increased by 34% in last 25 years in India. It has also been reported that despite having lower coronary risk factors compared to developed countries, incident cardiovascular mortality, cardiovascular events and case-fatality are greater in India. Reasons for the increasing trends and high mortality have not been studied. There is evidence that social determinants of IHD risk factors are widely prevalent and increasing. Epidemiological studies have reported low control rates of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and smoking/tobacco. Registries have reported greater mortality of acute coronary syndrome in India compared to developed countries. Secondary prevention therapies have significant gaps. Low quality cardiovascular care is an important risk factor in India. Package of interventions focusing on fiscal, intersectoral and public health measures, improvement of health services at community, primary and secondary healthcare levels and appropriate referral systems to specialized hospitals is urgently required.",
