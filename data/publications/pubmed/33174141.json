  "title": "Treatment of Post-Ablation Bronchopleural Fistula Using Percutaneous Synthetic Hydrogel Surgical Sealant: Initial Experience of Safety and Efficacy.",
  "abstract": "Purpose Bronchopleural fistula is a rare but serious complication of lung ablation, as it is difficult to treat and is associated with a high mortality rate. Standard therapy often relies on surgical pleurodesis, which can be particularly problematic in patients with poor baseline lung function. A minimally invasive treatment option for bronchopleural fistula may offer an alternative to surgery for appropriate patients. This case series describes the technique, safety and efficacy of percutaneously administered synthetic hydrogel surgical sealant in the treatment of post-ablation bronchopleural fistula in five patients. Materials and methods Retrospective chart review was carried out in five consecutive patients identified to have had BPF after lung ablation between 2009 and 2017 who were treated with percutaneous administration of synthetic hydrogel surgical sealant using CT guidance. Results The procedure was successfully carried out in all patients without immediate complications, and complete resolution of air leak was achieved in four of five patients (80%). Up to the most recent follow-up, no evidence of delayed complications or recurrent air leak was present (follow-up range 1 week-8 years). Conclusion The authors' initial experience shows that targeted surgical sealant is a potentially safe and effective alternative treatment of post-ablation persistent air leak.",
