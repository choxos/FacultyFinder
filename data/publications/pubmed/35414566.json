  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Glaucoma is a progressive, chronic condition that can have a significant impact on a patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Validated, disease-specific HRQoL tools such as the Health Utility for Glaucoma (HUG-5) tool and the Glaucoma Quality of Life Questionnaire (GlauQoL-17) can be used to monitor a patient's quality of life. However, the utility of these tools in outpatient clinic practice is not well established. The primary objective of this study is to characterise the feasibility of administering periodic HRQoL questionnaires in glaucoma using a semi-automated workflow. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study will be a single-centre, unblinded, randomised, parallel-group study with an exploratory data analysis framework. We aim to determine the feasibility of administering the HUG-5 in an outpatient clinic using a semi-automated workflow and determine patient engagement through email and telephone contact methods. We will also be investigating the association of the HUG-5 and GlauQoL-17 with patient visual field testing and visual acuity. Mean differences between groups will be tested with analysis of variance to determine if the frequency of calls affects burden, satisfaction and perceived value of information. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics board (ID: 13046) and will be conducted within Canadian Tri-Council Statement policy. Personal information of the study's participants will be anonymised with identification codes and data will be kept on an encrypted server. Results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conferences and internal meetings.",
