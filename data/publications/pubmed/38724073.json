  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate gout flare rates based on repeated serum urate (SU) measurements in a randomised controlled trial of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), accounting for dropout and death. METHODS: We performed a secondary analysis using data from Cardiovascular Safety of Febuxostat or Allopurinol in Patients with Gout, which randomised participants to febuxostat or allopurinol, titrated to target SU <6 mg/dL with flare prophylaxis for 6 months. SU was categorised as ≤3.9, 4.0-5.9, 6.0-7.9, 8.0-9.9 or ≥ 10 mg/dL at each 3-6 month follow-up. The primary outcome was gout flare. Poisson regression models, adjusted for covariates and factors related to participant retention versus dropout, estimated gout flare incidence rate ratios by time-varying SU category. RESULTS: Among 6183 participants, the median age was 65 years and 84% were male. Peak gout flare rates for all SU categories were observed in months 0-6, coinciding with the initiation of ULT and months 6-12 after stopping prophylaxis. Flare rates were similar across SU groups in the initial year of ULT. During months 36-72, a dose-response relationship was observed between the SU category and flare rate. Lower flare rates were observed when SU ≤3.9 mg/dL and greater rates when SU ≥10 mg/dL, compared with SU 4.0-5.9 mg/dL (p for trend <0.01). CONCLUSION: Gout flare rates were persistently higher when SU ≥6 mg/dL after the first year of ULT after accounting for censoring. The spike in flares in all categories after stopping prophylaxis suggests a longer duration of prophylaxis may be warranted.",
