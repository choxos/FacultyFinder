  "title": "Unmet Health Needs among Young Adults with Cerebral Palsy in Ireland: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "Data describing the unmet health needs of young adults with cerebral palsy (CP) may support the development of appropriate health services. This study aimed to describe unmet health needs among young adults with CP in Ireland and examine if these differed between young adults who were and were not yet discharged from children's services. In this cross-sectional study, young adults with CP aged 16-22 years completed a questionnaire assessing unmet health needs. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between discharge status and unmet health needs. Seventy-five young adults (mean age 18.4 yr; 41% female; 60% in GMFCS levels I-III) were included in the study. Forty (53%) had been discharged from children's services. Unmet health need, as a proportion of those with needs, was highest for speech (0.64), followed by epilepsy (0.50) and equipment, mobility, control of movement and bone or joint problems (0.39 or 0.38). After adjusting for ambulatory status, unmet health needs did not differ according to discharge status. The proportion of young adults with unmet health needs highlights the importance of taking a life-course approach to CP and providing appropriate services to people with CP regardless of age.",
