  "title": "The correlation between multiple congenital anomalies hypotonia seizures syndrome 2 and PIGA: a case of novel PIGA germline variant and literature review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: PIGA (PIG class A) gene codes for the PIG-A protein, which is a catalytic subunit of GPI-GlcNAc transferase. GPI-anchored proteins play an important role in the metabolism of mammals. Somatic variants of PIGA genes in bone marrow hematopoietic stem cells often result in paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, and the germline PIGA variants cause multiple congenital anomalies hypotonia seizures syndrome 2 (MCAHS2) because of glycosylphosphatidylinositol metabolic abnormalities. METHODS: Whole exome sequencing was performed on peripheral blood sample of the patient with MCAHS2. A novel germline PIGA variant was found, and Sanger sequencing was performed as verification for the variant. After that, we used the keywords to retrieve relevant reports and provided a literature review. RESULTS: A novel hemizygous germline PIGA variant (NM_002641.3:c.971G > A) at exon4 was identified through whole exome sequencing. And it was a highly probable pathogenic variant. Sanger sequencing yielded consistent results. The missense variant cause change of p.(Cys324Tyr) in the transcription product according to the predicted outcomes. CONCLUSION: We reported a case of MCAHS2 caused by a novel PIGA variant. Following a review of the literature, we suggested that MCAHS2 should be considered as a disorder spectrum consisting of core symptoms, multi-system impairment, and premature death. The core symptoms include hypotonia, psychomotor delay, epilepsy (intractable epilepsy mostly) and early death. Core symptoms nearly happened to almost all patients. Meanwhile, MCAHS2 involves a wide range of organ and system impairments with changeable form.",
