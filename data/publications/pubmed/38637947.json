  "title": "The clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization in IgG4-related disease: a claims-based analysis of commercially insured adults in the United States.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) can affect nearly any organ and is often treated with glucocorticoids, which contribute to organ damage and toxicity. Comorbidities and healthcare utilization in IgG4-RD are poorly understood. METHODS: We conducted a cohort study using claims data from a US managed care organization. Incident IgG4-RD cases were identified using a validated algorithm; general population comparators were matched by age, sex, race/ethnicity and index date. The frequency of 21 expert-defined clinical outcomes associated with IgG4-RD or its treatment and healthcare-associated visits and costs were assessed 12 months before and 36 months after the index date (date of earliest IgG4-RD-related claim). RESULTS: There were 524 cases and 5240 comparators. Most cases received glucocorticoids prior to (64.0%) and after (85.1%) the index date. Nearly all outcomes, many being common glucocorticoid toxicities, occurred more frequently in cases vs comparators. During follow-up, the largest differences between cases and comparators were seen for gastroesophageal reflux disease (prevalence difference: +31.2%, P < 0.001), infections (+17.3%, P < 0.001), hypertension (+15.5%, P < 0.01) and diabetes mellitus (+15.0%, P < 0.001). The difference in malignancy increased during follow-up from +8.8% to +12.5% (P < 0.001). Some 17.4% of cases used pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy during follow-up. Over follow-up, cases were more often hospitalized (57.3% vs 17.2%, P < 0.01) and/or had an emergency room visit (72.0% vs 36.7%, P < 0.01); all costs were greater in cases than comparators. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with IgG4-RD are disproportionately affected by adverse outcomes, some of which may be preventable or modifiable with vigilant clinician monitoring. Glucocorticoid-sparing treatments may improve these outcomes.",
