  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Workplace organizational policies and practices (OPPs) play a pivotal role in managing injury and disability. This study identifies the workplace OPPs in Ontario's education sector. METHODS: OPPs were examined using a cross-sectional survey with 157 participants. The relationship among the type of school, workplace OPPs and injury and disability outcomes were investigated. RESULTS: Mean subscale scores (potential range 1-5) varied from 3.1 (SD, 1.0) to 4.2 (SD, 0.6) for all schools. Private schools scored lowest on measures of disability prevention, disability management, and corporate culture. Ergonomic practices and return to work initiatives were achieved less frequently than other OPPs for all schools. Higher scores on safety diligence were associated with lower injury and disability incidence (proportion of variance explained ranged from 10 to 23%). Higher scores on people-oriented culture were associated with lower disability incidence and duration (proportion of variance explained ranged from 7 to 20%). CONCLUSIONS: Public schools engage more often in workplace OPPs than private schools. Improved achievements on safety diligence and people-oriented culture practices predict reduced injury and disability outcomes.",
