  "title": "Ethylenedioxy-PIP2 oxalate reduces ganglioside storage in juvenile Sandhoff disease mice.",
  "abstract": "Sandhoff disease is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal hydrolase Î²-hexosaminidase. Deficiency in this enzyme leads to excessive accumulation of ganglioside GM2 and its asialo derivative, GA2, in brain and visceral tissues. Small molecule inhibitors of ceramide-specific glucosyltransferase, the first committed step in ganglioside biosynthesis, reduce storage of GM2 and GA2. Limited brain access or adverse effects have hampered the therapeutic efficacy of the clinically approved substrate reduction molecules, eliglustat tartrate and the imino sugar NB-DNJ (Miglustat). The novel eliglustat tartrate analog, 2-(2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-2-yl)-N-((1R,2R)-1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1, 4]dioxin-6-yl)-1-hydroxy-3-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)propan-2-yl)acetamide (EtDO-PIP2, CCG-203586 or \"3h\"), was recently reported to reduce glucosylceramide in murine brain. Here we assessed the therapeutic efficacy of 3h in juvenile Sandhoff (Hexb-/-) mice. Sandhoff mice received intraperitoneal injections of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 3h (60 mg/kg/day) from postnatal day 9 (p-9) to postnatal day 15 (p-15). Brain weight and brain water content was similar in 3h and PBS-treated mice. 3h significantly reduced total ganglioside sialic acid, GM2, and GA2 content in cerebrum, cerebellum and liver of Sandhoff mice. Data from the liver showed that 3h reduced the key upstream ganglioside precursor (glucosylceramide), providing evidence for an on target mechanism of action. No significant differences were seen in the distribution of cholesterol or of neutral and acidic phospholipids. These data suggest that 3h can be an effective alternative to existing substrate reduction molecules for ganglioside storage diseases.",
