  "abstract": "AIM: The effect of the weekly exendin-based glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist efpeglenatide on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with and without chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: People with T2DM and glycated haemoglobin >7%, ≥18 years old with previous CV disease, or ≥50 years old with CKD [defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 25-59.9 mL/min/1.73 m[2] ], and one or more additional CV risk factors were recruited. Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by current, intended or neither current nor intended use of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor to receive weekly injections of efpeglenatide (4 mg or 6 mg) or masked placebo. The primary outcome is a major adverse CV event defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or CV death. Secondary outcomes include a composite kidney outcome (new onset macroalbuminuria with an increase from baseline of ≥30%, sustained 40% decrease in eGFR, renal replacement therapy, or sustained eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73 m[2]). The trial will continue until ≥330 participants have had a major adverse CV event outcome and the sample size was based on accruing enough outcomes to detect non-inferiority of efpeglenatide versus placebo. RESULTS: Recruitment of 4076 participants (33% women, mean age 64.5 years) occurred between 11 May 2018 and 25 April 2019 at 344 sites in 28 countries. Mean baseline glycated haemoglobin was 8.9% (1.5), 31.6% had an eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m[2] , 89.5% had previous CV disease and 15.0% were on an SGLT2 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the AMPLITUDE O trial will inform the use of exendin-based glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist to people with T2DM and high CV risk, with and without CKD, in the presence and absence of an SGLT2 inhibitor.",
