  "title": "Vascular Endothelial Dysfunction during Cardiac Surgery: On-Pump versus Off-Pump Coronary Surgery.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery often causes ischemia and development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which impairs vascular barrier function, normally maintained by the endothelial cell line and the endothelial glycocalyx (EG). The EG normally covers and protects healthy endothelial cells throughout the vasculature. The aim of the present study was to assess the disruption of the cellular part of the microvascular barrier by determining parameters of endothelial cell activation known to influence and reflect cell-cell junctional integrity. Particular attention was placed on angiopoietins and their important effects on endothelial gap junctions. Furthermore, comparative measurements were undertaken in patients undergoing on- and off-pump cardiac surgery, the latter group presumably experiencing less ischemic stress. METHODS: 30 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery were assigned to the conventional coronary artery bypass (CCAB) group (n = 15) or the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCAB) group (n = 15). Blood samples were obtained for measuring angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and endocan at various time points. RESULTS: There were significant increases in all measured parameters in both study groups versus the respective basal values. Maximal increases were as follows: Ang-1: CCAB +220%, OPCAB +166%, p < 0.05 each; Ang-2: CCAB +150%, OPCAB +20%, p < 0.05 each; VE-cadherin: CCAB +87%, OPCAB +66%, p < 0.05 each; endocan: CCAB +323%, OPCAB +72%, p < 0.05 each. CONCLUSION: The present study demonstrates the activation of endothelial cells, shedding of cell-cell contacts and a potential intrinsic counterregulation by Ang-1 and endocan in patients undergoing major cardiac surgery. Quantitatively greater deviations of parameters in the CCAB than in the OPCAB group suggest a relation between the occurrence of ischemia/reperfusion and the extent of endothelial activation.",
