  "abstract": "This study examined the association between T1198C polymorphism of the angiotensinogen (AGT) gene and the blood pressure response to ACE inhibitors in a Chinese hypertensive cohort. After a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, benazepril (10-20 mg/day) or imidapril (5-10 mg/day) was administered for 6 weeks to 509 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Polymerase chain reaction combined with restriction enzyme digestion was used to detect the polymorphism, and the patients were classified as having the TT, TC, or CC genotype. The achieved changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) were analyzed to determine their association with genotypes at the AGT gene locus. In the total 509 patients, the TT genotype was observed in 44 patients (8.7%), the TC genotype in 214 patients (42.0%), and the CC genotype in 251 patients (49.3%). The SBP reductions in patients with the TT genotype, TC genotype, and CC genotype were -15.3+/-12.7 mmHg, -14.0+/-12.7 mmHg, and -14.4+/-12.4 mmHg, respectively (p=0.809). The DBP reductions in patients with the TT genotype, TC genotype, and CC genotype were -8.5+/-8.1 mmHg, -8.3+/-7.5 mmHg, and -8.9+/-6.6 mmHg, respectively (p=0.638). There were no significant differences in the changes in SBP or DBP after treatment among the three genotype groups. In conclusion, these results suggest that the AGT genotype does not predict the blood pressure-lowering response to antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibitors in Chinese hypertensive patients.",
