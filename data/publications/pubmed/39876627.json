  "title": "Robotic versus laparoscopic colorectal surgery for patients with obesity: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity poses significant challenges in colorectal surgery, affecting operative difficulty and postoperative recovery. The choice of minimally invasive approach for this patient population remains a challenge during preoperative planning. This review aims to provide an updated synthesis of studies comparing laparoscopic and robotic approaches for adult patients with obesity undergoing colorectal surgery. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL were searched up to August 2023. Articles were included if they compared laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery outcomes in adults with obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m[2]). Outcomes included overall postoperative morbidity, conversion to laparotomy, and operative time. Inverse variance random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool effect estimates. RESULTS: After screening 2187 citations, 10 observational studies were included with 3281 patients with obesity undergoing robotic surgery (mean age: 58.1 years, female: 43.9%) and 11 369 patients with obesity undergoing laparoscopic surgery (mean age: 58 years, female: 53.2%). Robotic surgery resulted in longer operative times (MD 46.71 min, 95% CI 33.50-59.92, p < 0.01, I[2] = 93.79%) with statistically significant reductions in conversions to laparotomy (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39-0.65, p < 0.01, I[2] = 67.15%). No significant differences were seen in postoperative morbidity (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82-1.08, p = 0.40, I[2] = 36.08%). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that robotic colorectal surgery in patients with obesity may reduce the risk for conversion to laparotomy, but at the expense of increased operative times and with no overt benefits in postoperative outcomes. Further high quality randomized controlled trials assessing the utility of robotic surgery in patients with obesity undergoing colorectal surgery are warranted.",
