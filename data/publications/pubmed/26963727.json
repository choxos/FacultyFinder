  "title": "New perspectives on femoroacetabular impingement syndrome.",
  "abstract": "Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is characterized by an abnormality in the shape of the femoral head-neck or acetabulum that results in impingement between these two structures. Arthroscopic treatment has become the preferred method of management of FAI owing to its minimally invasive approach. Surgical correction involves resection of impinging osseous structures as well as concurrent management of the associated chondral and labral pathology. Research from the past 5 years has shown that repair of the labrum results in a better anatomic correction and improved outcomes compared with labral debridement. Research is underway to improve cartilage assessment by using innovative imaging techniques and biochemical tests to inform predictions of prognosis. Several ongoing randomized controlled trials, including the Femoroacetabular Impingement Trial (FAIT) and the Femoroacetabular Impingement Randomized Controlled Trial (FIRST), will provide critical information regarding the diagnosis, management and prognosis of patients undergoing arthroscopic management of FAI.",
