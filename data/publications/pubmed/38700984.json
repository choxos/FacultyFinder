  "abstract": "Mutations in the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene are associated with severe neurodevelopmental disorders. Loss of PTEN leads to hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), which functions in two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2. The downstream signaling mechanisms that contribute to PTEN mutant phenotypes are not well delineated. Here, we show that pluripotent stem cell-derived PTEN mutant human neurons, neural precursors, and cortical organoids recapitulate disease-relevant phenotypes, including hypertrophy, electrical hyperactivity, enhanced proliferation, and structural overgrowth. PTEN loss leads to simultaneous hyperactivation of mTORC1 and mTORC2. We dissect the contribution of mTORC1 and mTORC2 by generating double mutants of PTEN and RPTOR or RICTOR, respectively. Our results reveal that the synergistic hyperactivation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2 is essential for the PTEN mutant human neural phenotypes. Together, our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms that underlie PTEN-related neural disorders and highlight novel therapeutic targets.",
