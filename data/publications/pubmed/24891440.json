  "title": "Measures of readiness to transition to adult health care for youth with chronic physical health conditions: a systematic review and recommendations for measurement testing and development.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Review measures of readiness to transition to adult-oriented care for youth with chronic physical health conditions. METHODS: Identified measures via online searches and reference lists and reviewed methods of development, theoretical underpinnings, characteristics, and psychometrics. Measures were classified according to American Psychological Association Division 54 Evidence-Based Assessment (EBA) Task Force criteria. Strengths and weaknesses of reviewed measures were described. RESULTS: 56 measures were identified, of which 10 met inclusion criteria for this review. 6 were disease specific and 4 were generic. Some psychometric properties were reported for each; none reported predictive validity for transition outcomes. According to EBA criteria, the 10 measures met criteria for \"promising\" assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement development in transition readiness is still an underdeveloped area. Measures require further testing and new measures are needed. Recommendations include testing measures with larger and diverse samples, ground measures in theory, test psychometrics, and involve multiple stakeholders in measure development.",
