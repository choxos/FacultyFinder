  "title": "Abnormal Rho-associated kinase activity contributes to the dysfunctional myogenic response of cerebral arteries in type 2 diabetes.",
  "abstract": "The structural and functional integrity of the brain, and therefore, cognition, are critically dependent on the appropriate control of blood flow within the cerebral circulation. Inadequate flow leads to ischemia, whereas excessive flow causes small vessel rupture and (or) blood-brain-barrier disruption. Cerebral blood flow is controlled through the interplay of several physiological mechanisms that regulate the contractile state of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) within the walls of cerebral resistance arteries and arterioles. The myogenic response of cerebral VSMCs is a key mechanism that is responsible for maintaining constant blood flow during variations in systemic pressure, i.e., flow autoregulation. Inappropriate myogenic control of cerebral blood flow is associated with, and prognostic of, neurological deterioration and poor outcome in patients with several conditions, including type 2 diabetes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the role of inappropriate Rho-associated kinase activity as a cause of impaired myogenic regulation of cerebral arterial diameter in type 2 diabetes.",
