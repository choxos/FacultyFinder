  "title": "Transradial Angiography and Intervention in Acute Coronary Syndromes.",
  "abstract": "Considerable evidence supports transradial angiography and intervention in patients with acute coronary syndrome, with an emphasis on decreasing major bleeding and access site vascular complications. Patients undergoing invasive treatment are at greatest risk of bleeding and have the most to gain. The radial advantage has consistently been shown to translate into reduced mortality in pooled data analyses. The benefits of transradial access have been demonstrated across the acute coronary syndrome spectrum and in both sexes. A radial-first strategy should be the default approach and continuous efforts should be made to increase operator expertise of transradial access in these patients.",
