  "abstract": "Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are questionnaires designed to measure outcomes of importance to patients from their perspective. The BODY-Q is a PROM designed to measure outcomes in weight loss and/or body contouring surgery. To develop the BODY-Q, a literature review, 63 patient interviews, 22 cognitive interviews, and input from 9 clinical experts were used to develop a conceptual framework that covers 3 broad domains: appearance concerns, health-related quality of life, and experience of care. For each aspect of the framework, multiple independently functioning scales were developed.",
