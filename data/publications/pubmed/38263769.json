  "title": "Documenting the indication for antimicrobial prescribing: A retrospective observational study of long-term care homes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overuse of antimicrobials in residents of long-term care homes is common and can result in harm. Antimicrobial stewardship interventions are needed in the long-term care (LTC) homes setting to improve the appropriate use of antimicrobials. Previous literature has highlighted the importance of documenting antimicrobial indication as a strategy that contributes to improve antimicrobial use; however, there is a lack of evidence in LTC homes. This study examines the prevalence, clarity, and facility-level variability of antibiotic indication documentation in this setting. METHODS: This is an observational retrospective study of oral antibiotic prescriptions dispensed to 218 homes between January 1, 2021 and December 31, 2022 in Ontario, Canada. Indication was obtained from reviewing antibiotic prescription data. Clarity was determined by comparing documented indication to the National Antimicrobial Prescribing Survey (NAPS). Descriptive analysis was performed to examine the prevalence and clarity of indication documentation. Funnel plots were generated to examine variability in prevalence of indication documentation and clarity at the home level. RESULTS: Overall, 22.9% (7998/34,867) of prescriptions had an indication documented. The proportion of indications that were clear was 37% (2984/7998). The most common indications were for urinary (45%), skin and soft tissue (19.9%) and respiratory infections (15.0%). At the home level, the median prevalence of indication was 19.6% (interquartile range [IQR]: 10.8%-31.4%) and median prevalence of clear indications was 35.1% (IQR: 23.8%-42.9%). Funnel plots revealed substantial variability in indication prevalence with 46.3% of homes falling outside of 99% limits but minimal variability in indication clarity between homes with only 8.7% of homes outside of 99% control limits. CONCLUSIONS: There is an opportunity to increase both the prevalence and clarity of antibiotic prescriptions in LTC homes. Future work should focus on determining how best to support prescription indication documentation in this setting with consideration being given to prescription workflow and most common antibiotic prescription indications.",
