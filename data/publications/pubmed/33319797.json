  "title": "Arabidopsis antibody resources for functional studies in plants.",
  "abstract": "Here we report creation of a unique and a very valuable resource for Plant Scientific community worldwide. In this era of post-genomics and modelling of multi-cellular systems using an integrative systems biology approach, better understanding of protein localization at sub-cellular, cellular and tissue levels is likely to result in better understanding of their function and role in cell and tissue dynamics, protein-protein interactions and protein regulatory networks. We have raised 94 antibodies against key Arabidopsis root proteins, using either small peptides or recombinant proteins. The success rate with the peptide antibodies was very low. We show that affinity purification of antibodies massively improved the detection rate. Of 70 protein antibodies, 38 (55%) antibodies could detect a signal with high confidence and 22 of these antibodies are of immunocytochemistry grade. The targets include key proteins involved in hormone synthesis, transport and perception, membrane trafficking related proteins and several sub cellular marker proteins. These antibodies are available from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre.",
