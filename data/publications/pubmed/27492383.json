  "title": "Anterior hip capsuloligamentous reconstruction with Achilles allograft following gross hip instability post-arthroscopy.",
  "abstract": "The increasing use of hip arthroscopy has led to further development in our understanding of hip anatomy and potential post-operative complications. Iatrogenic gross hip instability following hip arthroscopy is a concerning complication described in recent orthopaedic literature. Post-arthroscopy hip instability is thought to be multifactorial, related to a variety of patient, surgical and post-operative factors. Given its infrequency, there is scarcity of literature describing appropriate surgical management and operative technique for addressing this instability. This study reports a case of gross hip instability following hip arthroscopy, describing a novel technique of management through anterior hip capsuloligamentous reconstruction with Achilles tendon allograft. Level of evidence V, Case Study.",
