  "title": "New method of intracoronary adenosine injection to prevent microvascular reperfusion injury in patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.",
  "abstract": "The aim of our study was to examine the role of a new, simple protocol of intracoronary adenosine administration performed during primary angioplasty on the immediate angiographic results and clinical course. A prospective, single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 70 consecutive patients (64 ± 14 years, 54 men) with acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was conducted. Patients were randomized to 2 groups. Group 1 (n = 35) received intracoronary adenosine (1 to 2 mg) with a hand injection through the guiding catheter 2 times: immediately after crossing the lesion of the infarct-related artery with guidewire and then after the first balloon inflation. Group 2 (n = 35) received placebo. The baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics of the 2 groups were similar. Percutaneous coronary intervention resulted in Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction grade 3 flow after PCI in 32 patients (91.4%) in the adenosine group and 27 patients (77.1%) in the placebo group (p = 0.059). Myocardial blush grade 3 was observed at the end of PCI in 23 patients (65.7%) in the adenosine group and 13 (37.1%) in the placebo group (p < 0.05). Resolution of ST-segment elevation (> 50%) was more frequently observed in the adenosine than in the placebo group: 27 (77%) versus 15 (43%), respectively (p < 0.01). In conclusion, intracoronary adenosine administration improved the angiographic and electrocardiographic results in patients with acute myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation undergoing PCI. Adenosine administration seemed to be associated with a more favorable clinical course.",
