  "title": "Social Media, Endometriosis, and Evidence-Based Information: An Analysis of Instagram Content.",
  "abstract": "Social media platforms are used for support and as resources by people from the endometriosis community who are seeking advice about diagnosis, education, and disease management. However, little is known about the scientific accuracy of information circulated on Instagram about the disease. To fill this gap, this study analysed the evidence-based nature of content on Instagram about endometriosis. A total of 515 Instagram posts published between February 2022 and April 2022 were gathered and analysed using a content analysis method, resulting in sixteen main content categories, including \"educational\", which comprised eleven subcategories. Claims within educational posts were further analysed for their evidence-based accuracy, guided by a process which included fact-checking all claims against the current scientific evidence and research. Of the eleven educational subcategories, only four categories (cure, scientific article, symptoms, and fertility) comprised claims that were at least 50% or greater evidence-based. More commonly, claims comprised varying degrees of evidence-based, mixed, and non-evidence-based information, and some categories, such as surgery, were dominated by non-evidence-based information about the disease. This is concerning as social media can impact real-life decision-making and management for individuals with endometriosis. Therefore, this study suggests that health communicators, clinicians, scientists, educators, and community groups trying to engage with the endometriosis online community need to be aware of social media discourses about endometriosis, while also ensuring that accurate and translatable information is provided.",
