  "title": "Role of rivaroxaban in sunitinib-induced renal injuries via inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation through the tissue nacrosis factor-α induced nuclear factor-κappa B signaling pathway in rats.",
  "abstract": "Rivaroxaban (RIVA) inhibits factor Xa and exhibits antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting several cellular signaling molecules. Sunitinib (SUN) is FDA approved first-line drug for metastatic renal cancers and advanced cancerous states of gastrointestinal tract. Present hypothesis was aimed to examine the nephroprotective potential of RIVA in SUN-induced nephrotoxicity, mediated through the inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation, via the TNF-α/NFk-B signaling pathways. Wistar rats 200-250 g were selected and divided randomely in 5 groups (n = 6): Group 1 kept as normal control; Group 2 as disease control and exposed to SUN 50 mg/kg thrice-weekly upto 21 days; Groups 3 and 4, were treatment groups and administered SUN 50 mg/kg thrice-weekly as of group 2 and treated with RIVA 5 and 10 mg/kg/daily for 21 days, respectively; and Group 5 fed with RIVA alone (10 mg/kg/daily for 21 days). Serum was separated from blood to estimate serum biochemical parameters and kidney tissues were collected to estimate antioxidant enzyme, mRNA and protein expression. SUN exposure significantly elevated levels of creatinine, urea, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, and bilirubin, and decreased serum magnesium and iron levels. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were significantly increased and glutathione and glutathione reductase levels were significantly decreased. Intracellular levels of caspase-3 and TNF-α were significantly increased; RIVA treatment restored the altered levels. In SUN-exposed animals, western blotting revealed significantly elevated NFk-B, IL-17, and MCP-1 expression, and IKBα levels were significantly downregulated; RIVA restored these levels to normal values.RIVA treatment significantly restored the apoptotic and inflammatory parameters in SUN-damaged renal tissues.",
