  "title": "Inherited Germline Cancer Susceptibility Gene Variants in Individuals with Non-Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Identification of inherited germline variants can guide personalized cancer screening, prevention, and treatment. Pathogenic and likely pathogenic (P/LP) germline variants in cancer predisposition genes are frequent among patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, but their prevalence and significance in patients with non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), the most common form of urothelial carcinoma, is understudied. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Germline analysis was conducted on paired tumor/normal sequencing results from two distinct cohorts of patients initially diagnosed with NMIBC. Associations between clinicopathologic features and clinical outcomes with the presence of P/LP germline variants in ≥76 hereditary cancer predisposition genes were analyzed. RESULTS: A similar frequency of P/LP germline variants were seen in our two NMIBC cohorts [12% (12/99) vs. 8.7% (10/115), P = 0.4]. In the combined analysis, P/LP germline variants were found only in patients with high-grade NMIBC (22/163), but none of the 46 patients with low-grade NMIBC (13.5% vs. 0%, P = 0.005). Fifteen (9.2%) patients with high-grade NMIBC had P/LP variants in DNA damage response genes, most within the nucleotide excision repair (ERCC2/3) and homologous recombination repair (BRCA1, NBN, RAD50) pathways. Contrary to prior reports in patients with NMIBC not receiving Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), P/LP germline variants were not associated with worse recurrence-free or progression-free survival in patients treated with BCG or with risk of developing upper tract urothelial carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support offering germline counseling and testing for all patients with high-grade bladder cancer, regardless of initial tumor stage. Therapeutic strategies that target impaired DNA repair may benefit patients with high-grade NMIBC.",
