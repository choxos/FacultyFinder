  "title": "Selection for early reproduction leads to accelerated aging and extensive metabolic remodeling in Drosophila melanogaster.",
  "abstract": "Experimental evolution studies that feature selection on life-history characters are a proven approach for studying the evolution of aging and variation in rates of senescence. Recently, the incorporation of genomic and transcriptomic approaches into this framework has led to the identification of hundreds of genes associated with different aging patterns. However, our understanding of the specific molecular mechanisms underlying these aging patterns remains limited. Here, we incorporated extensive metabolomic profiling into this framework to generate mechanistic insights into aging patterns in Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we characterized metabolomic change over adult lifespan in populations of D. melanogaster where selection for early reproduction has led to an accelerated aging phenotype relative to their controls. Using these data we: i) evaluated evolutionary repeatability across the metabolome; ii) assessed the value of the metabolome as a predictor of \"biological age\" in this system; and iii) identified specific metabolites associated with accelerated aging. Generally, our findings suggest that selection for early reproduction resulted in highly repeatable alterations to the metabolome and the metabolome itself is a reliable predictor of \"biological age\". Specifically, we find clusters of metabolites that are associated with the different rates of senescence observed between our accelerated aging population and their controls, adding new insights into the metabolites that may be driving the accelerated aging phenotype.",
