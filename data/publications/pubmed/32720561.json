  "title": "Outcomes and Resource Utilization Among Patients Admitted to the Intensive Care Unit Following Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition, accounting for a significant number of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. However, little is known about outcomes and costs among ICU patients admitted with acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD). We studied predictors of inhospital mortality and costs of ICU admissions for AECOPD. METHODS: Data were obtained from a prospectively maintained registry from 2 ICUs from 2011 to 2016, including adult patients (age ≥ 18) with an ICU discharge diagnosis of AECOPD. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay, resource utilization, total hospital costs, and cost per survivor. RESULTS: We included 390 patients, of which 27.2% died in hospital. Independent predictors of inhospital mortality included age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.95, CI: 1.58-2.67) and the presence of clinical frailty (OR: 4.12, CI: 2.26-6.95). The mean total hospital costs were Can$35 059, with a cost per survivor of Can$48 191. Factors associated with increased cost included transfer from an inpatient setting, severity of illness, and previous ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately a quarter of patients admitted to ICU with AECOPD died during hospitalization, and these patients accrued significant costs. This study identifies important factors associated with poor outcome in this at-risk population, which has value in risk stratification and patient or family discussions addressing goals of care.",
