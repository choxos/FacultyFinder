  "abstract": "AIM: The primary aim of this study was to review the diagnosis, management and outcome of Candida meningitis/ventriculitis in our hospital over a ten-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all culture and 18s rRNA nucleic acid positive CSF specimens processed between 1st January 2010 and 31st December 2020. Patient records were subsequently reviewed to assess the significance of the isolate. RESULTS: Of 851 culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens, Candida spp. were isolated from 29 (3.4%), representing infection in 12 patients. One culture-negative specimen was positive for Candida on 18s rRNA testing. Of the 13 patients, eight were male; 61.5% and the median age was 47 years; range: 20-70. The median interval from admission to onset of infection and culture positivity was 24 days (range: 1-63 days). All patients had a central nervous system (CNS) device in situ (external ventricular drain: 11; ventriculoperitoneal shunt: 1; lumbar drain: 1). Four were colonised with Candida spp. before meningitis/ventriculitis diagnosis, from wounds (n = 3), respiratory (n = 3), and urine (n = 1) specimens. On culture, the most common species was Candida albicans (n = 8), followed by C. parapsilosis (n = 2), C. tropicalis (n = 1), and C. dubliniensis (n = 1). The median number of follow-up CSFs per patient was nine (range; 3-22), with a median of 6 days to CSF sterility (range 3-10 days). Treatment included; liposomal amphotericin B (n = 5), fluconazole (n = 2), liposomal amphotericin B, and flucytosine (n = 2), liposomal amphotericin B, fluconazole and flucytosine (n = 3), and intra-ventricular amphotericin B (n = 1). Median treatment duration was 25 days (range 11-76) and CNS device removal occurred in 12 patients. The median length-of-stay (LOS) was 58 days (range 24-406). On discharge, moderate to severe disability (Modified Rankin Scale [mRS] 3-5) was evident in eight patients. Two patients died and one was lost to follow-up. CONCLUSION: Meningitis/ventriculitis due to Candida spp. is an uncommon but challenging infection, usually associated with a device, increased morbidity, LOS, and necessitating prolonged treatment. Neurosurgeons need to be aware of these issues in managing and in communicating with such complex patients.",
