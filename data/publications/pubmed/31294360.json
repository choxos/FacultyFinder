  "title": "Impact of Adalimumab Patient Support Program's Care Coach Calls on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Crohn's Disease in Canada: An Observational Retrospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is an antitumour necrosis factor (TNFα) biologic therapy indicated for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD). Patients receiving adalimumab in Canada are eligible to enroll in the AbbVie Care™ patient support program (AC-PSP), which provides personalized services, including care coach calls (CCCs). The objective of this study was to compare the likelihood of achieving clinical remission in a cohort of CD patients treated with adalimumab who did and did not receive CCCs. METHODS: A longitudinal analysis was performed using de-identified aggregate-level data collected through the AC-PSP. Patients were indexed on the date of their first injection of adalimumab between July 2010 and October 2014. The AC-PSP database included measurements of the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), a symptom-based measure of disease severity. Eligible patients had an initial HBI measurement performed between 90 days before and up to 30 days after the index date and a follow-up HBI measurement six to 18 months later. Adjusted relative risk (RR) of achieving remission (HBI ≤ 4) at the time of the follow-up was estimated comparing patients who received and did not receive CCCs. RESULTS: There were 381 CD patients who met eligibility criteria; 224 (59%) received CCCs, and 157 (41%) did not receive CCCs. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that CD patients receiving CCCs had a 17% increased likelihood of achieving HBI remission when compared with patients who did not receive CCCs (RR = 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03-1.34; P = 0.0192). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that a phone call intervention, aiming to improve the overall patient experience with adalimumab treatment, may increase the likelihood of HBI remission in patients taking adalimumab to manage CD.",
