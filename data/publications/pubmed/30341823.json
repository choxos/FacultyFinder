  "abstract": "Information of P2Y12 inhibitors in acute coronary syndromes with vein graft angioplasty is limited. This new analysis from the UK database was not able to find significant differences between Clopidogrel, Prasugrel and Ticagrelor. Large trials would be needed to reliably confirm the best antiplatelet regimen in this setting.",
