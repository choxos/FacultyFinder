  "title": "Rhythm vs. Rate Control in Patients with Postoperative Atrial Fibrillation after Cardiac Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is the most common complication after cardiac surgery; it is associated with morbidity and mortality. We undertook this review to compare the effects of rhythm vs. rate control in this population. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CENTRAL to March 2023. We included randomized trials and observational studies comparing rhythm to rate control in cardiac surgery patients with POAF. We used a random-effects model to meta-analyze data and rated the quality of evidence using GRADE. RESULTS: From 8,110 citations, we identified 8 randomized trials (990 patients). Drug regimens used for rhythm control included amiodarone in four trials, other class III anti-arrhythmics in one trial, class I anti-arrhythmics in four trials and either a class I or III anti-arrhythmic in one trial. Rhythm control compared to rate control did not result in a significant difference in length of stay (mean difference -0.8 days; 95% CI -3.0 to +1.4, I[2] = 97%), AF recurrence within 1 week (130 events; risk ratio [RR] 1.1; 95%CI 0.6-1.9, I[2] = 54%), AF recurrence up to 1 month (37 events; RR 0.9; 95%CI 0.5-1.8, I[2] = 0%), AF recurrence up to 3 months (10 events; RR 1.0; 95%CI 0.3-3.4, I[2] = 0%) or mortality (25 events; RR 1.6; 95%CI 0.7-3.5, I[2] = 0%). Effect measures from seven observational studies (1428 patients) did not differ appreciably from those in randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Although atrial fibrillation is common after cardiac surgery, limited low-quality data guide its management. Limited available evidence suggests no clear advantage to either rhythm or rate control. A large-scale randomized trial is needed to inform this important clinical question.",
