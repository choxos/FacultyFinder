  "abstract": "Congestive heart failure is prevalent in the elderly; recurrent hospital admissions for acute deterioration is a major health care problem. We examined tumor necrosis factor alpha levels in 31 congestive heart failure patients who were admitted to the hospital due to acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Blood samples were taken within 24 hours of admission and at the time of discharge after recovery. Tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were also measured in 10 stable congestive heart failure outpatients and 16 healthy controls. Tumor necrosis factor alpha level at admission was higher than at time of discharge (4.6Â+/-1.9 vs. 3.4Â+/-1.1 (rg/mL, p is less than 0.02). Mean tumor necrosis factor alpha level of stable congestive heart failure outpatient was 2.6Â+/-0.7 rg/mL healthy controls had significantly lower tumor necrosis factor alpha levels (1.7Â+/-0.7 rg/mL) than congestive heart failure patients (p is less than 0.01). tumor necrosis factor alpha levels were highest among acute congestive heart failure patients. Elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha appears to be related to the exacerbation of congestive heart failure and may be a marker for deterioration. (c) 2000 by CVRR, Inc.",
