  "title": "Single-Incision Approach to Implantation of the Pulse Generator and Leads for Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "Dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation has recently emerged as a treatment for persistent neuropathic pain, but the permanent implantation of stimulator leads and the pulse generator can be difficult and is sometimes associated with complications. We used a single-incision approach to tunnel and implant the leads and pulse generator for DRG stimulation treatment in a patient suffering from intractable foot pain. At long-term follow-up, the patient experienced a decrease in pain intensity and improvement in function, without any complications. A single-incision implantation technique for DRG stimulator implantation may simplify implantation and decrease the risk of complications.",
