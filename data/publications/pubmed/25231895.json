  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incidence of remission in adults with type 2 diabetes not treated with bariatric surgery and to identify variables associated with remission. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We quantified the incidence of diabetes remission and examined its correlates among 122,781 adults with type 2 diabetes in an integrated healthcare delivery system. Remission required the absence of ongoing drug therapy and was defined as follows: 1) partial: at least 1 year of subdiabetic hyperglycemia (hemoglobin A1c [HbA₁c] level 5.7-6.4% [39-46 mmol/mol]); 2) complete: at least 1 year of normoglycemia (HbA₁c level <5.7% [<39 mmol/mol]); and 3) prolonged: complete remission for at least 5 years. RESULTS: The incidence density (remissions per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI) of partial, complete, or prolonged remission was 2.8 (2.6-2.9), 0.24 (0.20-0.28), and 0.04 (0.01-0.06), respectively. The 7-year cumulative incidence of partial, complete, or prolonged remission was 1.47% (1.40-1.54%), 0.14% (0.12-0.16%), and 0.007% (0.003-0.020%), respectively. The 7-year cumulative incidence of achieving any remission was 1.60% in the whole cohort (1.53-1.68%) and 4.6% in the subgroup with new-onset diabetes (<2 years since diagnosis) (4.3-4.9%). After adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics, correlates of remission included age >65 years, African American race, <2 years since diagnosis, baseline HbA₁c level <5.7% (<39 mmol/mol), and no diabetes medication at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: In community settings, remission of type 2 diabetes does occur without bariatric surgery, but it is very rare.",
