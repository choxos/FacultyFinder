  "abstract": "Several studies have explored the disproportionate number of children of color involved in child protective services, raising concerns that racial bias in the system results in more women of color being referred to child protection. The authors conducted a case series to analyze whether a woman's race and ethnicity influenced referrals to child protective services in a domestic violence context. Data were obtained through interview records of 263 women (38% women of color) at a Minneapolis-based advocacy and therapy organization. The findings suggest that women who face multiple forms of oppressions may have greater risk of being involved with child protection services.",
