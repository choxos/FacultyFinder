  "title": "Predictors of Survival and Favorable Neurologic Outcome in Patients Treated with eCPR: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation (eCPR) can improve survival in selected patients with cardiac arrest (CA). In this meta-analysis, we evaluated factors associated with short-term survival and favorable neurologic outcome (FNO) post-eCPR. In June 2019, we systematically searched electronic databases for studies reporting on survival and predictors associated with short-term survival or FNO post-eCPR using multivariable analysis. We meta-analyzed outcomes and predictors using the inverse variance method with a random-effects model. We identified 92 studies with 13 factors amenable to meta-analysis. Pooled short-term survival and FNO were 25% and 16% respectively. Lower lactate, return of spontaneous circulation, shockable rhythm, shorter CPR duration, baseline pH, shorter low-flow time, and history of hypertension were significantly associated with short-term survival. In addition, shockable rhythm, lower lactate, and use of targeted temperature management were associated with FNO. The identified factors associated with short-term survival and FNO post-eCPR could guide prognosis prediction at the time of CA.",
