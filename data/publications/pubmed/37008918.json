  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Serum creatinine is associated with cardiovascular risk and cardiovascular events, however, the relationship between serum creatinine levels and cardiovascular risk is not well established in hypertensive population in Jiangsu Province. We aimed to evaluate the association of serum creatinine levels with traditional cardiovascular risk factors and 10-year cardiovascular risk in a Chinese hypertensive population. METHODS: Participants were patients with hypertension registered and enrolled in health service centers in 5 counties or districts from January 2019 to May 2020 in Jiangsu Province of China followed strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, demographics as well as clinical indicators and disease history and lifestyle were collected. Participants were divided into four groups according to quartiles of serum creatinine levels, then the China-PAR model was used to calculate 10-year cardiovascular risk for each individual. RESULTS: A total of 9978 participants were enrolled in this study, 4173(41.82%) were males. The blood pressure level and prevalence of dyslipidemia, elderly, current smokers and drinking as well as obesity were higher in the Q4 group than the Q1 group (all P < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression showed that serum creatinine in the Q4 group compared with that in the Q1 group was positively associated with overweight and obesity (OR=1.432, 95% CI 1.237-1.658, P<0.001), while negatively associated with physical activity (OR=0.189, 95%CI 0.165-0.217, P<0.001), and so on. Multiple linear regression showed 10-year cardiovascular risk is positively associated with serum creatinine levels after adjusting for multiple risk factors (Î²=0.432, P< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Serum creatinine was associated with several traditional cardiovascular risk factors and the 10-year cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients. Creatinine-reduction and kidney-sparing therapy are essential for patients with hypertension to optimize control of cardiovascular risk.",
