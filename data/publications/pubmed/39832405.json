  "abstract": "Food allergies affect millions of individuals worldwide, significantly impacting personal health and the economy. While avoiding allergenic foods remains the primary management strategy, consumers lack reliable means for immediate allergen detection in everyday dining settings. Here, we present iEAT2 (integrated Exogenous Allergen Test 2), an advanced electrochemical sensing system for rapid, on-site food allergen detection. Building upon our previous assay system, the iEAT2 features technical breakthroughs: i) a complete kit for sample processing, including a torsion device for food grinding, and ii) a new strategy for multi-electrode measurements, which enables the simultaneous detection of multiple allergens in a simplified electronic architecture. We designed a compact iEAT2 prototype capable of 16 electrochemical reactions. Experimental validation confirmed the independent electrochemical measurements in a simultaneous operation. Furthermore, the entire testing protocol was completed within 15 min, from allergen extraction to detection. The platform detected three common food allergens (gliadin, Ara h1, and ovalbumin) at concentrations below established allergic reaction thresholds. It also effectively identified cross-contamination events in real-world food samples. This technology may empower consumers to monitor food safety and improve its management.",
