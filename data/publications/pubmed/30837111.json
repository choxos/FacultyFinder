  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedure worldwide. There is currently no consensus on which revisional procedure is best after an initial SG. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and safety between single-anastomosis duodeno-ileal bypass (SADI) or biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD-DS) versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) as a revisional procedure for SG. SETTING: University Hospital, Canada. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and PubMed were searched up to August 2018. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they compared SADI or BPD-DS with RYGB as a revisional bariatric procedure for SG. Primary outcome was absolute percentage of total weight loss. Secondary outcomes were length of stay, adverse events, and improvement or resolution of co-morbidities (diabetes, hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia). Pooled mean differences were calculated using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Six retrospective cohort studies involving 377 patients met the inclusion criteria. The SADI/BPD-DS group achieved a significantly higher percentage of total weight loss compared with RYGB by 10.22% (95% confidence interval, -17.46 to -2.97; P = .006). However, there was significant baseline equivalence bias with 4 studies reporting higher initial body mass index (BMI) in the SADI/BPD-DS group. There were no significant differences in length of stay, adverse events, or improvement of co-morbidities between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: SADI, BPD-DS, and RYGB are safe and efficacious revisional surgeries for SG. Both SADI and RYGB are efficacious in lowering initial BMI but there is more evidence for excellent weight loss outcomes with the conversion to BPD-DS when the starting BMI is high. Further randomized trials are required for definitive conclusions.",
