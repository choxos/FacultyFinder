  "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Historically, two antibiotics (metronidazole and vancomycin) and a recent third (fidaxomicin) have been used for CDI treatment; convincing data are now available showing that metronidazole is the least efficacious agent. The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) management guidance for CDI were updated in 2021. This guidance document outlines the treatment options for a variety of CDI clinical scenarios and for non-antimicrobial management (e.g., faecal microbiota transplantation, FMT). One of the main changes is that metronidazole is no longer recommended as first-line CDI treatment. Rather, fidaxomicin is preferred on the basis of reduced recurrence rates with vancomycin as an acceptable alternative. Recommended options for recurrent CDI now include bezlotoxumab as well as FMT.A 2017 survey of 20 European countries highlighted variation internationally in CDI management strategies. A variety of restrictions were in place in 65% countries prior to use of new anti-CDI treatments, including committee/infection specialist approval or economic review/restrictions. This survey was repeated in November 2022 to assess the current landscape of CDI management practices in Europe. Of 64 respondents from 17 countries, national CDI guidelines existed in 14 countries, and 11 have already/plan to incorporate the ESCMID 2021 CDI guidance, though implementation has not been surveyed in 6. Vancomycin is the most commonly used first-line agent for the treatment of CDI (n = 42, 66%), followed by fidaxomicin (n = 30, 47%). Six (9%) respondents use metronidazole as first-line agent for CDI treatment, whereas 22 (34%) only in selected low-risk patient groups. Fidaxomicin is more likely to be used in high-risk patient groups. Availability of anti-CDI therapy influenced prescribing in six respondents (9%). Approval pre-prescription was required before vancomycin (n = 3, 5%), fidaxomicin (n = 10, 6%), bezlotoxumab (n = 11, 17%) and FMT (n = 10, 6%). Implementation of CDI guidelines is rarely audited.Novel anti-CDI agents are being evaluated; it is not yet clear what will be the roles of these agents. The treatment of recurrent CDI is particularly troublesome, and several different live biotherapeutics are being developed, in addition to FMT.",
