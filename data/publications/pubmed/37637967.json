  "title": "Intraocular Lens Unfurling Time Exponentially Decays with Increased Solution Temperature.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Intraocular lens (IOL) unfurling can be a rate-limiting step in cataract surgery, limiting operative efficiency. Furthermore, inefficient unfurling has important implications for clinical outcomes. We examine the effects of solution temperature on IOL unfurling time using three in vitro models of the ocular environment. METHODS: IOLs were injected into a 6-well plate filled with balanced salt solution (BSS), dispersive ophthalmic viscoelastic device (OVD), or cohesive OVD. Experiments were also performed in a plastic eye filled with dispersive or cohesive OVD. IOL unfurling time was recorded against the temperature of the respective solution. RESULTS: IOL unfurling time decayed exponentially as solution temperature increased in all experiments, including the BSS-filled 6-well plate, the OVD-filled 6-well plate, and the OVD-filled plastic eye. IOLs failed to unfurl within 10 min at 10째C, below the glass transition temperature of the tested IOLs. Increasing solution temperature from 20째C to 30째C decreases IOL unfurling by greater than 2 min. Further heating to 40째C did not significantly decrease IOL unfurling time. CONCLUSION: Increased solution temperature rapidly decreases IOL unfurling time in vitro. IOLs do not unfurl within a clinically acceptable timeframe at or below their glass transition temperature. Increased BSS and/or OVD temperature may be a potential method to decrease IOL unfurling time in cataract surgery. However, future research is needed to elucidate potential consequences of warmed BSS and/or OVD on post-operative outcomes. This study demonstrates the potential for temperature regulation to decrease cataract surgery operative time and provides preliminary evidence to justify future clinical validation of this relationship.",
