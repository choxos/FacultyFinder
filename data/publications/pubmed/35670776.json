  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gestational hyperglycemia is associated with deleterious neonatal outcomes, but long-term risks for offspring obesity are less clear. We estimated the odds for offspring adolescent overweight and obesity among mothers with gestational glucose intolerance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a mother-offspring historical cohort, the Israel military conscription data set was linked to a large health maintenance organization. Included were women who were evaluated at adolescence and underwent two-step gestational diabetes screening (mean age, 31 years) with a 50-g glucose challenge test (GCT), followed by a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) if the result was abnormal. Glucose tolerance categories included gestational normoglycemia, abnormal GCT with normal OGTT, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT; one abnormal OGTT value), and gestational diabetes. The primary outcome was offspring overweight/obesity (BMI â‰¥85th percentile) at adolescence, measured prior to military conscription. Logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: Of 33,482 mother-offspring pairs, overweight and obesity were observed in 6,516 offspring. Across increasing categories of pregnancy glycemia, the proportions of offspring with adolescent overweight/obesity increased: normoglycemia, 19%; abnormal GCT with normal OGTT, 22%; gestational IGT, 24%; and gestational diabetes, 25% (P < 0.0001). Corresponding odds ratios after adjustment for the mother's late adolescent characteristics (sociodemographic confounders and BMI) and pregnancy age were 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.4), 1.3 (1.2-1.5), and 1.4 (1.3-1.6), respectively. Further adjustment for offspring birth weight percentile and sociodemographic variables did not materially change results. Associations were more pronounced with increasing obesity severity. CONCLUSIONS: Gestational glucose intolerance, including categories not meeting the gestational diabetes threshold, was associated with increased odds for offspring overweight/obesity at late adolescence.",
