  "title": "Perceived Helpfulness of a Moderated Online Social Therapy Network for Young People Experiencing Social Anxiety.",
  "abstract": "There is a growing need for more effective delivery of digital mental health interventions, particularly for individuals experiencing difficulty accessing or engaging with traditional face-to-face therapy. Young people with social anxiety, and young males with social anxiety in particular need interventions sensitized to their needs. While digital interventions for mental health have proliferated, increasing their accessibility and utility, the data on acceptability and effectiveness of these interventions, however, indicates a need for improvement. The current study sought to utilise qualitative data from semi-structured interviews with 70 participants (male n = 33; age range = 14-25 years, mean age = 19.8) from a single-group pilot study of a novel intervention for young people with social anxiety (Entourage), using a content analysis approach. Results indicated that participants spoke about five main categories: connection, anxiety management, appeal, disengagement and system improvement. No overt gender differences were found in the appeal or perceived helpfulness of the Entourage platform. The current study provides valuable information and suggestions to guide future improvement of digital interventions for young people, particularly those experiencing social anxiety.",
