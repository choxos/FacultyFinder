  "title": "Improving Health and Healthcare Access for People Who Experience Imprisonment in Ontario.",
  "abstract": "People who experience imprisonment have worse health status than other Ontarians - about 40% lack access to primary care in the community, and the period after release from prison is associated with high risks of adverse health outcomes. Population-based correctional and health administrative data suggest that access to quality healthcare in prison and in the community needs to improve if we are to improve population health and deliver on healthcare obligations to people experiencing imprisonment.",
