  "title": "Blood Omega-3 Fatty Acids Are Inversely Associated With Albumin-Creatinine Ratio in Young and Healthy Adults (The Omega-Kid Study).",
  "abstract": "Background: Omega-3 fatty acids are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and with beneficial effects on CV risk factors. The albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) is a risk factor for CVD, all-cause mortality and accelerated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline in the general population. We aimed to investigate the association between n-3 PUFAS and ACR in heathy individuals with preserved GFR. Design and Methods: The present cross-sectional analysis is part of the GAPP study, a population-based cohort of healthy adults aged 25-41 years. Individuals with known CVD, diabetes, or a BMI >35 kg/m[2] were excluded. eGFR was calculated according to the combined Creatinine/Cystatin C CKD-EPI formula. ACR was obtained from a fasting morning urine sample. The Omega-3 Index (relative amount of EPA and DHA of total fatty acids in %) was obtained from whole blood aliquots. Results: Overall, 2001 participants (median age 37 years IQR 31; 40, 53% female) were included in this analysis. Median Omega-3 Index was 4.59 (IQR 4.06; 5.25) and median eGFR 111 ml/min/1.73 m[2] (IQR 103; 118). Median ACR was 0.14 mg/mmol (IQR 0; 0.43). We found a significant inverse association of the Omega-3 Index with ACR (ratio 0.84, 95%CI 0.73-0.96; p = 0.011) which remained after comprehensive adjustment (ratio 0.86, 95%CI 0.74-1.00; p = 0.048). No association of the Omega-3 Index with eGFR was found. The adjusted difference in eGFR per 1-unit increase in Omega3-Index was -0.21 (95%CI -0.76; 0.35; p = 0.47). Conclusions: A higher Omega-3 Index was significantly associated with lower ACR in this young and healthy population with preserved eGFR. Omega-3 fatty acids may exhibit cardio- and nephroprotective effects in healthy individuals through modulation of ACR.",
