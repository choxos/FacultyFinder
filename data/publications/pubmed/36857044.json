  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Prevalences of alopecia areata (AA), alopecia totalis (AT), and alopecia universalis (AU) are poorly established. OBJECTIVE: To estimate overall and subgroup prevalences of AA and its subtypes. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study using electronic records comprising the Explorys database (Watson Health, IBM Corporation) included children, adolescents, and adults seeking healthcare across the 4 census regions in the US between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2019. The statistical analysis was conducted between July 21, 2022, and December 22, 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Prevalent cases of AA, AT, and AU. RESULTS: Of the 1 093 176 patients who met inclusion criteria, 1812 had at least 1 code for AA, 1216 female (67%) and 596 male (33%) patients. Overall age-and-sex standardized prevalences among adults and among children and adolescents were observed to be 0.18% and 0.10%, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence ratio in women to men was 1.32. Standardized prevalence was highest in those aged 30 to 39 (297 per 100 000; 95% CI, 263-335) and 40 to 49 (270 per 100 000; 95% CI, 240-303) years. The highest standardized prevalence was observed among Asian patients (414 per 100 000; 95% CI, 306-548), followed by patients reporting another race or multiple races (314 per 100 000; 95% CI, 266-368), Black (226 per 100 000; 95% CI, 199-255), and Hispanic/Latino (212 per 100 000; 95% CI, 129-328) patients. White patients had the lowest standardized prevalence (168 per 100 000; 95% CI, 157-179) among racial and ethnic subgroups. Relative to White patients, standardized prevalence ratios for Asian, Black, and Hispanic/Latino patients were 2.47 (95% CI, 2.17-2.81), 1.35 (95% CI, 1.26-1.44), and 1.26 (95% CI, 1.03-1.55), respectively. Cases of AT and AU comprised approximately 9% of patients diagnosed with AA. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that there is a significant burden of AA, AT, and AU in the US in which people of color, particularly Asian Americans, appear to be disproportionately affected.",
