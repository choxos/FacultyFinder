  "abstract": "Ovarian tumor progression is marked by the peritoneal accumulation of leukocytes. Among these leukocytes, an immunosuppressive CD11b(+)CD11c(+) population has been identified in both human and ovarian tumors. The use of transplantable models of murine ovarian tumors has demonstrated that this population promotes ovarian tumor growth, whereas elimination of this population has been shown to inhibit ovarian tumor progression. Despite the demonstrated importance of these cells to ovarian tumor progression, the mechanisms by which these cells are recruited to the peritoneal tumor are largely unknown. Therefore, this study analyzes the mechanisms these cells use to migrate to the peritoneum with the goal of therapeutically blocking their recruitment and subsequent immunosuppressive activity. Recent studies have identified that CX(3)CR1, Gr-1, and CCR2 delineate phenotypic and functional murine monocyte subsets. Here, we report that CX(3)CR1(lo)Gr-1(hi) cells dominate the population of peritoneal CD11b(+) leukocytes early in murine tumor development; however, the CX(3)CR1(hi) population of cells present in the peritoneum dramatically increases in both total numbers and percentage during tumor progression. Functional analyses reveal that both of these CX(3)CR1 subsets are immunosuppressive to naive CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cell responses. Importantly, we demonstrate that CCR2 is a critical functional facilitator of leukocyte recruitment to the ovarian tumor microenvironment, and its genetic deletion results in a reduced tumor burden compared with wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that subsets of immunosuppressive leukocytes are recruited to the ovarian tumor environment through the CCR2 pathway, which offers a viable therapeutic target to inhibit their migration to the tumor site.",
