  "title": "Impact of Perioperative Complications on Living Kidney Donor Health-Related Quality of Life and Mental Health: Results From a Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although living kidney donation is safe, some donors experience perioperative complications. OBJECTIVE: This study explored how perioperative complications affected donor-reported health-related quality of life, depression, and anxiety. DESIGN: This research was a conducted as a prospective cohort study. SETTING: Twelve transplant centers across Canada. PATIENTS: A total of 912 living kidney donors were included in this study. MEASUREMENTS: Short Form 36 health survey, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory. METHODS: Living kidney donors were prospectively enrolled predonation between 2009 to 2014. Donor perioperative complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification system. Mental and physical health-related quality of life was assessed with the 3 measurements; measurements were taken predonation and at 3- and 12-months postdonation. RESULTS: Seventy-four donors (8%) experienced a perioperative complication; most were minor (n = 67 [91%]), and all minor complications resolved before hospital discharge. The presence (versus absence) of a perioperative complication was associated with lower mental health-related quality of life and higher depression symptoms 3-month postdonation; neither of these differences persisted at 12-month. Perioperative complications were not associated with any changes in physical health-related quality of life or anxiety 3-month postdonation. LIMITATIONS: Minor complications may have been missed and information on complications postdischarge were not collected. No minimal clinically significant change has been defined for kidney donors across the 3 measurements. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight a potential opportunity to better support the psychosocial needs of donors who experience perioperative complications in the months following donation.
