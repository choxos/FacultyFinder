  "title": "Neurological applications of belzutifan in von Hippel-Lindau disease.",
  "abstract": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a tumor predisposition syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL gene that presents with visceral neoplasms and growths, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, and central nervous system manifestations, such as hemangioblastomas of the brain and spine. The pathophysiology involves dysregulation of oxygen sensing caused by the inability to degrade HIFα, leading to the overactivation of hypoxic pathways. Hemangioblastomas are the most common tumors in patients with VHL and cause significant morbidity. Until recently, there were no systemic therapies available for patients that could effectively reduce the size of these lesions. Belzutifan, the first approved HIF-2α inhibitor, has demonstrated benefit in VHL-associated tumors, with a 30% response rate in hemangioblastomas and ~30%-50% reduction in their sizes over the course of treatment. Anemia is the most prominent adverse effect, affecting 76%-90% of participants and sometimes requiring dose reduction or transfusion. Other significant adverse events include hypoxia and fatigue. Overall, belzutifan is well tolerated; however, long-term data on dosing regimens, safety, and fertility are not yet available. Belzutifan holds promise for the treatment of neurological manifestations of VHL and its utility may influence the clinical management paradigms for this patient population.",
