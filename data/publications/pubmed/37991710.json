  "title": "Changing Knowledge and Attitudes towards Bariatric Surgery in Primary Care: a 10-Year Cross-Sectional Survey.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Some 28% of the Scottish population suffer from obesity. Bariatric procedures per population carried out in England when compared to Scotland (NBSR 2018) are significantly higher. Primary care practitioners (PCP) influence equality of access to secondary care bariatrics and frequently manage post-operative bariatric patients. Examining changes in PCP knowledge and attitude could improve access to bariatric procedures in Scotland. METHODS: Following a sample pilot, all PCPs within three Scottish NHS health boards were emailed a questionnaire-based survey (2011; n = 902). A subsequent 10-year follow-up encompassed a greater scope of practice, additionally distributed to all PCPs in five further health boards (2021; n = 2049). RESULTS: Some 452 responses were achieved (2011, 230; 2021, 222). PCPs felt bariatric surgery offered a greater impact in both weight management and that of obesity-related diseases (p < .0001). More PCPs were aware of local bariatric surgical referral criteria (2011, 43%; 2021, 57% (p = .003)), and more made referrals (2011, 60%; 2021, 72% (p = .018)) but were less familiar with national bariatric surgical guidelines (2011, 70%; 2021, 48% (p < .001)). Comfort at managing post-operative bariatric surgical patients were unchanged (2011, 24%; 2021, 27% (p = .660)). Minimal progress through dietetic-lead weight management services, plus rejection of patients thought to be good candidates, was reasons for referral hesitancy. CONCLUSION: Over 10 years, PCPs were more aware of local referral criteria, making increased numbers of referrals. Knowledge deficits of national guidelines remain, and overwhelmingly PCPs do not feel comfortable looking after post-operative bariatric surgical patients. Further research into PCP educational needs, in addition to improving the primary to secondary care interface, is required.",
