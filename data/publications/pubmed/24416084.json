  "title": "Sources of Human Insecurity in Post-War Situations: The Case of Gaza.",
  "abstract": "This paper explores classical and war-related factors associated with human insecurity reports in the Gaza Strip following the winter 2008-09 Israeli attack. A cross-sectional survey was conducted six months after the Israeli attack with adults from 3017 households. Results demonstrate that persons with greater human capital and socioeconomic resources were somewhat protected from human insecurity associated with the attack and siege. Results also underscore the significance of including both classical and war-related factors in assessing human insecurity in conflict, and the link between individual and communal/national security. While it is important to intervene by supporting Gazans with food and aid, interventions should also address the violence of war and ongoing siege as one of the causes of human insecurity.",
