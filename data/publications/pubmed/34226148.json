  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease leads to stenosis of the major cardiac vessels, resulting in ischemia and infarction. Percutaneous intervention (PCI) with balloon angioplasty can re-open stenosed vessels. Drug eluting stents (DES) and intravascular brachytherapy (IVBT) and drug-coated balloons (DCBs) are proven to decrease the likelihood of another restenosis after PCI, but neither is completely effective. Due to the limited long-term effectiveness of IVBT or DCB used separately for salvage PCI, we combined the two in some poor prognosis patients. METHODS: Combined IVBT+DCB was intended for a total of 36 patients from 2015-2020. PCI with some combination of ballooning, laser and directional/rotational atherectomy was used to maximally open the stenotic region prior to IVBT+DCB. Beta-radiation brachytherapy for all patients was done with a Novoste Beta-Cath. Lutonix 4.0 x 40 mm paclitaxel-coated balloons (Bard, Murray Hill, NJ) were employed. RESULTS: Overall survival at two years was 88%. Nine patients had follow-up angiograms, all for cardiac symptoms. Time from IVBT+DCB to follow-up angiography ranged from 4 to 33 months. The average months PCI-free interval before brachy therapy was 11.1 mos (95% CI 1.03-23.25) versus 23.3 mos after VBT (23.3 95% CI 12.3-32.3). The mean difference was 11.2 mos (95% CI 1.06-21.4, p < 0.031). None of the follow-up angiographic procedures displayed evidence of what could be interpreted as radiation damage. CONCLUSIONS: In this uncontrolled series, IVBT plus DCB appeared to lengthen the ISR-free interval relative to what had been achieved prior to the combined intervention. We view these results as mildly encouraging, worthy of further study.",
