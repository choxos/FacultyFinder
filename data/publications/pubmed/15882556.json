  "title": "Caffeine tolerance is incomplete: persistent blood pressure responses in the ambulatory setting.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Caffeine in dietary doses is a well-established pressor agent. Tolerance to this pressor effect occurs in only about half of regular consumers in acute laboratory tests. The clinical significance of this incomplete tolerance depends on whether the pressor effect is maintained throughout the day with repeated intake. Therefore, we examined the ability of a standard dose of caffeine (250 mg x 3) to maintain a blood pressure (BP) elevation during 18 hours of ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) after 5 days of regular daily intake of varying background doses. METHODS: Eighty-five men and women completed a four-week double blind, crossover trial. During each week, subjects consumed capsules totaling 0, 300, or 600 mg/day of caffeine in 3 divided doses. On day 6, they consumed capsules with either 0 or 250 mg at 9:00 am and 1:00 pm, in the laboratory, and again at 6:00 pm during ABPM. Tolerance was defined as a reduction in the diastolic BP response to two challenge doses given in the lab in response to increasing daily intake. Data were analyzed using multivariate repeated measures analysis of variance. RESULTS: BP responses to caffeine above those found on placebo-placebo (P-P) week were found for both tolerance groups when caffeine was consumed after a week of receiving a placebo. However, only the low tolerance group showed increases, above those found on P-P week, after 300 mg/day in systolic/diastolic BP during the waking hours (mean +/- standard error of the mean = 2.8 +/- 1.1, P = .01/2.2 +/- 0.9, P = .02) and in systolic BP during sleep (2.3 +/- 1, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent elevations in BP occurring on a daily basis in some habitual caffeine consumers may hold clinical significance.",
