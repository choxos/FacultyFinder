  "title": "Protocol for establishing and evaluating a cancer cachexia mouse model.",
  "abstract": "Cancer cachexia mouse models are needed to recapitulate the clinical features of patients with cachexia. Here, we present a protocol for the establishment and evaluation of cancer cachexia mouse models. We delineate the steps in preparing tumor cells for inoculation and surgical procedures. After the establishment of these mouse models, we describe essential techniques to assess cancer cachexia, including grip strength evaluation, tissue collection, and the calculation of cross-sectional areas of muscle tissue. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Liu et al.,[1] Yang et al.,[2] Shi et al.,[3] and Zhou et al.[4].",
