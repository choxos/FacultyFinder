  "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the levels and diagnostic accuracy of a set of potential biomarkers of periodontal tissue metabolism in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) from patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and asymptomatic apical periodontitis (AAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty one GCF samples from 11 CP patients, 44 GCF samples from 38 AAP patients and 31 GCF samples from 13 healthy volunteers were obtained (N = 106). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) -2 and -9 were determined by zymography; levels of MMP-8 by ELISA and IFMA and MPO by ELISA. IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, DKK-1, Osteonectin, Periostin, TRAP-5 and OPG were determined by a multiplex quantitative panel. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The MMP-9 and MMP-8 were higher in CP, followed by AAP, versus healthy individuals (p < 0.05). ProMMP-2, MPO, IL-1, IL-6, PTN, TRAP-5 and OPG were significantly higher in CP when compared with AAP and healthy patients (p < 0.05). The highest diagnostic accuracies were observed for ProMMP-2, ProMMP-9, MMP-8 and TRAP-5 (AUC > 0.97) in CP, and for the active form of MMP-9 and MMP-8 (AUC > 0.90) in AAP. CONCLUSION: Gingival crevicular fluid composition is modified by CP and AAP. MMP-9 and MMP-8 show diagnostic potential for CP and AAP, whereas MMP-2 and TRAP-5 are useful only for CP.",
