  "title": "Identifying Patients with Osteoarthritis at Risk of Sarcopenia using the SARC-F.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia is an important modifiable risk factor in patients being considered for elective knee or hip replacement as it may be associated with a higher risk of post-operative joint replacement complications. Our objectives are to determine the prevalence of patients with osteoarthritis at risk of sarcopenia by using the SARC-F tool, and whether risk of sarcopenia is associated with referral to an orthopaedic surgeon. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients who were 60 years or older assessed at four Canadian musculoskeletal assessment centres. Patients completed the SARC-F as part of their assessment. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine association between risk of sarcopenia and the odds of referral to an orthopedic surgeon for surgical consultation. RESULTS: 3,697 patients were included and 67.8% (2,508/3,697) were at risk of sarcopenia. Prevalence was highest in those assessed for hip replacement at 72.3% (635/878). Patients at risk of sarcopenia were more likely to be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon (OR 1.299; SD 1.074-1.571). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with osteoarthritis assessed for joint replacement are at high risk of sarcopenia, particularly individuals undergoing potential hip replacement. Patients at risk of sarcopenia are more likely to be referred to orthopaedic surgery for surgical consultation.",
