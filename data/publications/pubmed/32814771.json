  "title": "Chemotherapeutic resistance of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is mediated by EpCAM induction driven by IL-6/p62 associated Nrf2-antioxidant pathway activation.",
  "abstract": "Overexpression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) has been associated with chemotherapeutic resistance, leads to aggressive tumor behavior, and results in an adverse clinical outcome. The molecular mechanism by which EpCAM enrichment is linked to therapeutic resistance via Nrf2, a key regulator of antioxidant genes is unknown. We have investigated the link between EpCAM and the Nrf2 pathway in light of therapeutic resistance using head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patient tumor samples and cell lines. We report that EpCAM was highly expressed in Nrf2-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC cells. In addition, cisplatin-resistant tumor cells consisted of a higher proportion of EpCAM[high] cells compared to the cisplatin sensitive counterpart. EpCAM[high] populations exhibited resistance to cisplatin, a higher efficiency in colony formation, sphere growth and invasion capacity, and demonstrated reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity. Furthermore, Nrf2 expression was significantly higher in EpCAM[high] populations. Mechanistically, expression of Nrf2 and its target genes were most prominently observed in EpCAM[high] populations. Silencing of EpCAM expression resulted in the attenuation of expressions of Nrf2 and SOD1 concomitant with a reduction of Sox2 expression. On the other hand, silencing of Nrf2 expression rendered EpCAM[high] populations sensitive to cisplatin treatment accompanied by the inhibition of colony formation, sphere formation, and invasion efficiency and increased ROS activity. The molecular mechanistic link between EpCAM expression and activation of Nrf2 was found to be a concerted interaction of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and p62. Silencing of p62 expression in EpCAM[high] populations resulted in the attenuation of Nrf2 pathway activation suggesting that Nrf2 pathway activation promoted resistance to cisplatin in EpCAM[high] populations. We propose that therapeutic targeting the Nrf2-EpCAM axis might be an excellent approach to modulate stress resistance and thereby survival of HNSCC patients enriched in EpCAM[high] populations.",
