  "title": "Statins and renovascular disease in the elderly: a population-based cohort study.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: More than 90% of cases of renovascular disease (RVD) are caused by atherosclerosis; thus patients with this condition are at high risk for vascular events. We examined the association of statins with prognosis in patients with RVD. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a population-based cohort study in 4040 patients with RVD older than 65 years using province-wide health data in Ontario, Canada. The primary outcome was time to first cardiorenal event, specifically myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, acute renal failure, dialysis or death; the primary analysis used a time-dependent covariate for statin exposure. Despite having a greater burden of cardiovascular and renal comorbidity, the risk of the primary outcome was significantly lower in statin users than in non-users [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-0.57; P < 0.0001]. This association was materially unchanged after adjusting for demographic characteristics, cardiovascular risk factors, other comorbidities, measures of health-care utilization, screening, and concomitant medications (adjusted HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.46-0.57). An analysis using the same endpoint in a propensity-matched cohort without time-dependent statin exposure revealed a lower risk of the primary outcome in statin-treated patients but with a substantially more conservative point estimate (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.71-0.95). CONCLUSION: These data suggest that statins are associated with improved prognosis in elderly patients with RVD.",
