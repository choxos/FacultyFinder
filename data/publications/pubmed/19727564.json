  "title": "Pleomorphic liposarcoma originating from intracranial dura mater.",
  "abstract": "Liposarcomas are the most common soft tissue sarcoma found in adults; however, disease involving or spreading to the head and neck is extremely rare. To our knowledge, we present the first case of primary pleomorphic liposarcoma originating intracranially. A 56-year-old man presented with new weakness and imaging findings confirming a right frontal mass. After resection, histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of pleomorphic liposarcoma. The patient underwent radiation treatment and surveillance imaging, which revealed no other areas of disease. Results reported previously in the literature indicate that pleomorphic liposarcoma is very aggressive in nature. The authors review the few cases of primary or metastatic pleomorphic liposarcoma that have been reported involving the head.",
