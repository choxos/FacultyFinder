  "title": "Exploring the potential of bacterial-augmented floating treatment wetlands for the remediation of detergent-contaminated water.",
  "abstract": "Due to industrialization and urbanization, the use of detergents inadvertently led to contamination of aquatic environments, thus posing potential threat to aquatic organisms and human health. One of the main components of detergents is linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), which can cause toxic effects on living organisms, particularly aquatic life in the environment. In this study, floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) mesocosms were developed and augmented with LAS-degrading bacteria. The plant species, Brachiaria mutica (Para grass), was vegetated to establish FTWs and bacterial consortium (1:1:1:1) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain PJRS20, Bacillus sp. BRRH60, Acinetobacter sp. strain CYRH21, and Burkholderia phytofirmans Ps.JN was augmented (free or immobilized) in these mesocosms. Results revealed that the FTWs removed LAS from the contaminated water and their augmentation with bacteria slightly increased LAS removal during course of the experiment. Maximum reduction in LAS concentration (94%), chemical oxygen demand (91%), biochemical oxygen demand (93%), and total organic carbon (91%) was observed in the contaminated water having FTWs augmented with bacterial consortium immobilized on polystyrene sheet. This study highlights that the FTWs supported with immobilized bacteria on polystyrene sheets can provide an eco-friendly and sustainable solution for the remediation of LAS-bearing water, especially for developing countries like Pakistan.",
