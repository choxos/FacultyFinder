  "title": "Male pediatric, adolescent, and young adult reproductive survivorship.",
  "abstract": "As pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancer survival rates increase, emphasis is placed on reducing late effects, including reproductive complications and potential impact to fertility. Male survivors are at risk of abnormalities in sperm, hormone deficiencies, and sexual dysfunction. This can impact one's progression into puberty and ability to have a biological child and impacts quality of life following treatment. Access to reproductive care is important and requires patient assessment and appropriate referral to reproductive specialists. This review addresses reproductive complications associated with therapy, standard-of-care testing, and therapeutic interventions. The psychologic impact on psychosexual functioning is also addressed.",
