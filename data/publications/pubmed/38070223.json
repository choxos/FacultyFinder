  "title": "MALAT1: A key regulator in lung cancer pathogenesis and therapeutic targeting.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a formidable global health burden, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving its progression. Recently, lncRNAs have become necessary controllers of various biological functions, including cancer development. MALAT1 has garnered significant attention due to its multifaceted role in lung cancer progression. Lung cancer, among other malignancies, upregulates MALAT1. Its overexpression has been associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient prognosis. MALAT1 promotes cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and angiogenesis in lung cancer, collectively facilitating tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, MALAT1 enhances cancer cell invasion by interacting with numerous signaling pathways. Furthermore, MALAT1 has been implicated in mediating drug resistance in lung cancer, contributing to the limited efficacy of conventional therapies. Recent advancements in molecular biology and high-throughput sequencing technologies have offered fresh perspectives into the regulatory networks of MALAT1 in lung cancer. It exerts its oncogenic effects by acting as a ceRNA to sponge microRNAs, thereby relieving their inhibitory effects on target genes. Moreover, MALAT1 also influences chromatin remodeling and post-translational modifications to modulate gene expression, further expanding its regulatory capabilities. This review sheds light on the multifaceted roles of MALAT1 in lung cancer progression, underscoring its potential as an innovative therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker. Targeting MALAT1 alone or combined with existing therapies holds promise to mitigate lung cancer progression and improve patient outcomes.",
