  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The uptake of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for colorectal cancer (CRC) varies between jurisdictions. We aimed to identify the factors associated with the uptake of MIS for early-stage CRC and its oncologic outcomes in the Canadian province of Ontario. METHODS: This study includes all patients with CRC in Ontario from 2007 to 2017. A logistic regression analysis was used to identify the predictors of MIS and a flexible parametric survival model to estimate survival rates based on MIS versus open surgery. RESULTS: In total, 14,675 patients with CRC were identified of which 29.5% had MIS resections. The likelihood of undergoing MIS decreased with age, disease stage, and distance to the regional cancer center, and increased with year of diagnosis. The likelihood of mortality for MIS was significantly lower compared to open surgery (p < 0.001). In terms of survival, MIS was most beneficial to older patients with stage II disease, despite their lower likelihood of receiving MIS. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the lower uptake of MIS among older patients and patients with stage II disease, these patients had the greatest long-term survival benefit from MIS. This suggests further use of laparoscopy to patient populations that are often excluded.",
