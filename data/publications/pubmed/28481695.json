  "title": "A new frontier in treatment of advanced melanoma: Redefining clinical management in the era of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",
  "abstract": "Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment of advanced cutaneous melanoma. This group of novel therapeutic agents differs from other systemic treatments and has necessitated a new approach for several fundamental aspects of clinical practice in oncology. Marked differences in outcomes associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with other systemic therapies has required a new paradigm for prognostication in the setting of advanced melanoma. Distinct patterns of tumor response have required new norms for disease monitoring. A unique spectrum of toxicity is associated with use of immune checkpoint inhibitors which can be severe and refractory. Patients and clinicians must be informed regarding immune-related adverse events, yet in the published literature, there is substantial variability in reporting. As immune checkpoint inhibitors gain a prominent role in cancer treatment, standardization of adverse event reporting will be vital to ensure validity of evidence and to promote safe clinical practice.",
