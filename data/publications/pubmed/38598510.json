  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and costs of a brief, group-delivered parenting intervention for families of children with eczema. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial design was used. Families attending the Queensland Children's Hospital and from the community (n = 257) were assessed for eligibility (child 2-10 years, diagnosed with eczema, prescribed topical corticosteroids). Families who consented to participate (N = 59) were assessed at baseline for clinician-rated eczema severity, parent-reported eczema symptom severity, and electronically-monitored topical corticosteroid adherence (primary outcomes); and parenting behavior, parents' self-efficacy and task performance when managing eczema, eczema-related child behavior problems, and child and parent quality of life (secondary outcomes). Families were randomized (1:1, unblinded) to intervention (n = 31) or care-as-usual (n = 28). The intervention comprised two, 2-hr Healthy Living Triple P group sessions (face-to-face/online) and 28 intervention families attended one/both sessions. All families were offered standardized eczema education. Families were reassessed at 4-weeks post-intervention and 6-month follow-up, with clinician-raters blinded to condition. Costs of intervention delivery were estimated. RESULTS: Multilevel modeling across assessment timepoints showed significant intervention effects for ineffective parenting (d = .60), self-efficacy (d = .74), task performance (d = .81), and confidence with managing eczema-related child behavior (d = .63), but not disease/symptom severity, treatment adherence or quality of life. Mean cost per participating family with parenting behavior (clinically) improved was $159. CONCLUSIONS: Healthy Living Triple P is effective in reducing ineffective parenting practices and improving parents' self-efficacy and task performance when managing children's eczema and eczema-related behavior difficulties. There was no effect on disease/symptom severity, treatment adherence, or quality of life. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ACTRN12618001332213.",
