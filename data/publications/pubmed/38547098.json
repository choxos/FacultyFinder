  "abstract": "The study was designed to ascertain the diagnostic efficacy of hand-held digital refractometer in determining total protein (TP). The Sipli sheep (n = 128) were grouped as per gender (females = 99, males = 29) and age (G1 = up till 1 year, n = 35; G2 = from 1 to 2 years, n = 63; G3 = above 2 years, n = 30). The results regarding the overall mean (±SE) values for the TPs attained through serum chemistry analyzer (TP1) and hand-held digital refractometer (TP2) were non-significantly (P≥0.05) different (59.2±1.6g/L and 59.8±0.5g/L, respectively). However, the reference intervals (RIs) were quite different for the two TPs being 45.1-95.7g/L and 57.0-67.0g/L for TP1 and TP2, respectively. Similar results were seen for gender-wise and group-wise results. On the contrary, the results regarding correlation coefficient and logilinear regression showed a negative correlation between the two TPs (r = -0.0244) with an adjusted r-square of 0.059 (5.9% probability). Furthermore, the three tests implied to assess the level of agreement between the two methods (Cronbach alpha, Intraclass correlation coefficient, and Bland & Altman test) revealed least agreement between the two methods. In a nutshell, the results of TP through digital refractometer were not in concordance with those attained through serum chemistry analyzer. However, it can cautiously be used if these results are compared with relevant corrected RIs.",
