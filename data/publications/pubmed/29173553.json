  "title": "What Is the State of the Evidence in Anterolateral Ligament Research?",
  "abstract": "The anterolateral ligament (ALL) is a capsular structure of the knee that is the subject of increasing academic interest. This article reviewed recent ALL literature in terms of subject matter and quality. Although current literature focusing on the ALL is small and limited to level 4 and 5 evidence, it is rapidly expanding. Cadaveric studies describing ALL biomechanics are the most common study design, followed by radiographic studies. The methodologic quality of cadaveric studies focusing on the ALL is high. Clinically oriented research pertaining to the diagnosis, therapy, prevalence, or prognosis of injury to the ALL is presently lacking.",
