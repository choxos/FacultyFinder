  "title": "Segregation and recombination of a multipartite mitochondrial DNA in populations of the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida.",
  "abstract": "The discovery that the potato cyst nematode Globodera pallida has a multipartite mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) composed, at least in part, of six small circular mtDNAs (scmtDNAs) raised a number of questions concerning the population-level processes that might act on such a complex genome. Here we report our observations on the distribution of some scmtDNAs among a sample of European and South American G. pallida populations. The occurrence of sequence variants of scmtDNA IV in population P4A from South America, and that particular sequence variants are common to the individuals within a single cyst, is described. Evidence for recombination of sequence variants of scmtDNA IV in P4A is also reported. The mosaic structure of P4A scmtDNA IV sequences was revealed using several detection methods and recombination breakpoints were independently detected by maximum likelihood and Bayesian MCMC methods.",
