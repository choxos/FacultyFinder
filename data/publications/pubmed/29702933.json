  "title": "Assessment of Preference for Hormonal Treatment-Related Health States among Patients with Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: 1) To obtain preference scores from patients with breast cancer in Singapore for different stages of breast cancer and hormonal therapy-related adverse effects, and 2) to determine the association of patients' demographic and clinical characteristics with those preference scores. METHODS: A total of 22 health states were used to elicit preference values from 64 patients with breast cancer. At each interview, 14 health states were randomly selected and rated by the patient using the visual analogue scale and standard gamble methods to derive health state preference scores, which were recalibrated to the scale of 0 (death) and 1 (perfect health). RESULTS: Mean adjusted visual analogue scale scores ranged from 0.25 (no recurrence with ischemic cerebrovascular events) to 0.82 (no recurrence with no adverse effects). Mean adjusted standard gamble scores ranged from 0.31 (distant recurrence with chemotherapy-related adverse effects) to 0.80 (no recurrence with no adverse effects). Adverse effects ischemic cerebrovascular events and spine fracture resulted in the greatest decline in health state preference scores. Age, ethnicity, education level, and prior chemotherapy were associated with preference scores. Having children was not found to be associated with the preference scores. CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account disease progression and hormonal therapy-related adverse effects as well as their impact on health-related quality of life, this study quantifies patients' preference for various breast cancer-related health states. The findings offer valuable information for future cost-utility analysis of breast cancer treatments.",
