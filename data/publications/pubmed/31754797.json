  "title": "Electrochemical selection of a DNA aptamer, and an impedimetric method for determination of the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 by self-assembly of a thiolated aptamer on a gold electrode.",
  "abstract": "The autosomal recessive-hyper immunoglobulin E syndromes (AR-HIES) are inherited inborn primary immunodeficiency disorders caused mainly by mutations in the dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) gene. A method is described for the selection of DNA aptamers against DOCK8 protein. The selection was performed by using a gold electrode as the solid matrix for immobilization of DOCK8. This enables voltammetric monitoring of the bound DNA after each selection cycle. After eight rounds of selection, high affinity DNA aptamers for DOCK8 were identified with dissociation constants (Kds) ranging from 3.3 to 66 nM. The aptamer which a Kd of 8.8 nM was used in an aptasensor. A gold electrode was modified by self-assembly of the thiolated aptamer, and the response to the DOCK8 protein was detected by monitoring the change in the electron transfer resistance using the ferro/ferricyanide system as a redox probe. The aptasensor works in the 100 pg.mL[-1] to 100 ng.mL[-1] DOCK8 concentration range, has a detection limit of 81 pg.mL[-1] and good selectivity over other proteins in the serum. Graphical abstractSchematic representation of an electrochemical screening protocol for the selection of DNA aptamer against dedicator of cytokinesis 8 protein using electrode as solid support for target immobilization.",
