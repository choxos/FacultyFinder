  "title": "Enhancing the delivery of comprehensive care for people living with HIV in Canada: insights from citizen panels and a national stakeholder dialogue.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are living longer with health-related disability associated with ageing, including complex conditions. However, health systems in Canada have not adapted to meet these comprehensive care needs. METHODS: We convened three citizen panels and a national stakeholder dialogue. The panels were informed by a plain-language citizen brief that outlined data and evidence about the challenge/problem, elements of an approach for addressing it and implementation considerations. The national dialogue was informed by a more detailed version of the same brief that included a thematic analysis of the findings from the panels. RESULTS: The 31 citizen panel participants emphasized the need for more prevention, testing and social supports, increased public education to address stigma and access to more timely data to inform system changes. The 21 system leaders emphasized the need to enhance person-centred care and for implementing learning and improvement across provinces, territories and Indigenous communities. Citizens and system leaders highlighted that policy actions need to acknowledge that HIV remains unique among conditions faced by Canadians. CONCLUSIONS: Action will require a national learning collaborative to support spread and scale of successful prevention, care and support initiatives. Such a collaborative should be grounded in a rapid-learning and improvement approach that is anchored on the needs, perspectives and aspirations of people living with HIV; driven by timely data and evidence; supported by appropriate decision supports and aligned governance, financial and delivery arrangements; and enabled with a culture of and competencies for rapid learning and improvement.",
