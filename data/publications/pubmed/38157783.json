  "title": "Pain and quality of life of patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing hemodialysis in Aseer region, Saudi Arabia.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain has an adverse effect on HRQoL and has social, psychological, and physical repercussions for ESRD patients. In the present study, we assessed chronic pain in ESRD patients on HD in terms of severity and interference with activity. We also assessed the impact it has on these patients, along with looking at the factors that were linked to QoL in this population. METHODS: A multicenter, cross-sectional study carried out between April and July of 2023 in the hemodialysis units of Asir Central Hospital and Khamis Mushait General Hospital. Brief Pain Inventory and European Quality of Life scale 5 dimensions (EQ-5D) scale, including its European Quality of Life visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) component, were used to assess pain and QoL, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 97 participants were included in the final study. The average interference level of pain with daily functions was 22.5 ± 15.0 out of 70. The mean interference score was significantly higher among patients at rural areas (28.2 ± 16.3; P = 0.012), and those who undergone dialysis session for ≥ 4 times per week (31.6 ± 16.7; P = 0.026). The overall score of quality of life ranged from 20% to 92% with mean score of 36.5 ± 12.8%. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed that patients with higher BMI, more frequent dialysis sessions per week, and higher level of pain interference with daily functions demonstrated lower QoL (B= - 2.36, - 1.46, and - 0.64, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pain has a significant negative impact on QoL in ESRD patients undergoing HD. Patients with higher BMI, more frequent dialysis sessions, and higher level of pain interference with daily functions are at higher risk of lower QoL. These findings provide valuable information for educators, physicians, and other healthcare providers working with patients undergoing HD.",
