  "title": "Understanding the influence of medical education on physician geographic disposition: A qualitative study of family physician perspectives in Canada.",
  "abstract": "RATIONALE: Primary care access challenges are experienced by many communities. In several jurisdictions, including Canada, family physicians (FP) have the professional autonomy to organize their practice in alignment with professional and personal interests. Although system-level interventions are tremendously important, investment in upstream interventions associated with the medical education of graduating FPs is a promising strategy for ameliorating primary healthcare access challenges. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: This study investigates the medical education experiences that influence FP's decisions about practice locations in Canada. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with FPs who completed undergraduate and postgraduate medical training in Canada and now have a practice in Ontario, Canada. Interview data were coded and analysed using an unconstrained descriptive approach. RESULTS: FPs preferred practice locations are intimately tied to their desired practice scope. Practice preferences were shaped through training experiences with patient populations, heightened clinical responsibilities, practice models and locations, professional mentorships and networks. Proximity to family, partner and lifestyle preferences, cultural connections and the available practice opportunities also shaped practice location decisions. CONCLUSION: Medical education influences the identification and refinement of professional family practice preferences. Health workforce policies and interventions should leverage medical education to promote more equitable primary healthcare access.",
