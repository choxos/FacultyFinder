  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms within the excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), an essential component of DNA repair mechanisms, have been associated with various malignancies. This study aimed to evaluate the association of the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3212986 and rs11615 within the ERCC1 gene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Study Design: A case-control study. METHODS: Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood samples of 83 NSCLC patients and 119 healthy individuals. The genetic diversity of SNPs rs3212986 and rs11615 was determined using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. The RFLP results were confirmed through sequencing. RESULTS: The TT genotype of the rs11615 SNP was associated with a higher risk of NSCLC development (odds ratio: 3.900, 95% confidence interval: 0.603, 22.866, P=0.050). Furthermore, the AA genotype of rs3212986 was related to a higher risk of NSCLC development (OR: 2.531, 95% CI: 1.017, 6.300, P=0.046). A significant association was observed between smoking and lung cancer (OR: 3.072, 95% CI: 1.715, 5.503, P<0.001). Moreover, among non-smokers, there was an association between lung cancer risk and the AA (OR: 6.825, 95% CI: 1.722, 27.044, P=0.006) and AC (OR: 2.503, 95% CI: 0.977, 6.412, P=0.056) genotypes of rs3212986. However, no correlation was found between the genotypes of these SNPs and patients' sensitivity to cisplatin and carboplatin (P Ëƒ 0.05). CONCLUSION: The rs11615-related TT genotype and the rs3212986-related AA genotype may be associated with a higher risk of lung cancer development.",
