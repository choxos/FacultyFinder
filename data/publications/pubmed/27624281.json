  "title": "Thiol dependent intramolecular locking of Orai1 channels.",
  "abstract": "Store-operated Ca(2+) entry mediated by STIM1-gated Orai1 channels is essential to activate immune cells and its inhibition or gain-of-function can lead to immune dysfunction and other pathologies. Reactive oxygen species interacting with cysteine residues can alter protein function. Pretreatment of the Ca(2+) selective Orai1 with the oxidant H2O2 reduces ICRAC with C195, distant to the pore, being its major redox sensor. However, the mechanism of inhibition remained elusive. Here we combine experimental and theoretical approaches and show that oxidation of Orai1 leads to reduced subunit interaction, slows diffusion and that either oxidized C195 or its oxidomimetic mutation C195D located at the exit of transmembrane helix 3 virtually eliminates channel activation by intramolecular interaction with S239 of transmembrane helix 4, thereby locking the channel in a closed conformation. Our results demonstrate a novel mechanistic model for ROS-mediated inhibition of Orai1 and identify a candidate residue for pharmaceutical intervention.",
