  "title": "Acute kidney injury requiring renal replacement therapy in people with COVID-19 disease in Ontario, Canada: a prospective analysis of risk factors and outcomes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Severely ill people with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are at risk of acute kidney injury treated with renal replacement therapy (AKI-RRT). The understanding of the risk factors and outcomes for AKI-RRT is incomplete. METHODS: We prospectively collected data on the incidence, demographics, area of residence, time course, outcomes and associated risk factors for all COVID-19 AKI-RRT cases during the first two waves of the pandemic in Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: There were 271 people with AKI-RRT, representing 0.1% of all diagnosed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases. These included 10% of SARS-CoV-2 admissions to intensive care units (ICU). Median age was 65 years, with 11% <50 years, 76% were male, 47% non-White and 48% had diabetes. Overall, 59% resided in the quintile of Ontario neighborhoods with the greatest ethnocultural composition and 51% in the two lowest income quintile neighborhoods. Mortality was 58% at 30 days after RRT initiation, and 64% at 90 days. By 90 days, 20% of survivors remained RRT-dependent and 31% were still hospitalized. On multivariable analysis, people aged >70 years had higher mortality (odds ratio 2.4, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 4.6). Cases from the second versus the first COVID-19 wave were older, had more baseline comorbidity and were more likely to initiate RRT  >2 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis (34% versus 14%; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: AKI-RRT is common in COVID-19 ICU admissions. Residency in areas with high ethnocultural composition and lower socioeconomic status are strong risk factors. Late-onset AKI-RRT was more common in the second wave. Mortality is high and 90-day survivors have persisting high morbidity.",
