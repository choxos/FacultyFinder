  "title": "Cellulose Dissolution, Modification, and the Derived Hydrogel: A Review.",
  "abstract": "The cellulose-based hydrogel has occupied a pivotal position in almost all walks of life. However, the native cellulose can not be directly used for preparing hydrogel due to the complex non-covalent interactions. Some literature has discussed the dissolution and modification of cellulose but has yet to address the influence of the pretreatment on the as-prepared hydrogels. Firstly, the \"touching\" of cellulose by derived and non-derived solvents was introduced, namely, the dissolution of cellulose. Secondly, the \"conversion\" of functional groups on the cellulose surface by special routes, which is the modification of cellulose. The above-mentioned two parts were intended to explain the changes in physicochemical properties of cellulose by these routes and their influences on the subsequent hydrogel preparation. Finally, the \"reinforcement\" of cellulose-based hydrogels by physical and chemical techniques was summarized, viz., improving the mechanical properties of cellulose-based hydrogels and the changes in the multi-level structure of the interior of cellulose-based hydrogels.",
