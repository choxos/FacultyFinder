  "title": "Comparison of the Safety and Efficacy of On-Pump (ONCAB) versus Off-Pump (OPCAB) Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery in the Elderly: A Review of the ANZSCTS Database.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The elderly population (age >70 years) incurs greater mortality and morbidity following CABG. Off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) may mitigate these outcomes. A retrospective analysis of the results of OPCAB in this population was performed. METHODS: We reviewed the Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons' (ANZSCTS) database for elderly patients (n=12697) undergoing isolated CABG surgery and compared the on-pump coronary artery bypass (ONCAB) (n=11676) with OPCAB (n=1021) technique. Preoperative and intraoperative risk factors, and postoperative outcomes were analysed. Survival analyses was performed after cross-matching the database with the national death registry to identify long-term mortality. RESULTS: High-risk patients were more prevalent in the ONCAB group (p<0.05). OPCAB patients received fewer distal anastomoses than ONCAB patients (2.4±1.1 vs 3.3±1.0, p<0.001). Thirty-day mortality and stroke rates between OPCAB and ONCAB were not significantly different (2% vs 2.5% and 1.1% vs 1.8%, respectively). There was a non-significant trend towards improved 10-year survival in OPCAB patients using multivariate analysis (78.8% vs. 73.3%, p=0.076, HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.67-1.02). CONCLUSIONS: Mortality and stroke rates following CABG surgery are extremely low in the elderly suggesting that surgery is a safe management option for coronary artery disease in this population. OPCAB did not offer a significant advantage over ONCAB with regards to 30-day mortality, stroke and long-term survival. Further prospective randomised trials will be necessary to clarify risks or benefits in the elderly.",
