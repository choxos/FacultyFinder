  "title": "The Anticancer Journey of Liquiritin: Insights into Its Mechanisms and Therapeutic Prospects.",
  "abstract": "Liquiritin (LIQ), a bioactive flavonoid from Glycyrrhiza species, has shown significant potential in cancer therapy. LIQ exhibits potent inhibitory effects on various cancer cell types, including breast, lung, liver, and colon cancers, while demonstrating low toxicity towards healthy cells. Its anticancer mechanisms include inducing cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis, and modulating inflammation-related pathways. Additionally, LIQ impedes angiogenesis and enhances the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies through sensitization and synergistic effects with other natural compounds and targeted therapies. These multifaceted actions highlight LIQ as a promising candidate for further development as an anticancer agent. This abstract provides an overview of LIQ's chemistry, biological effects, and underlying mechanisms.",
