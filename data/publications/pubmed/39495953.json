  "abstract": "Untreated behavioral health conditions among the perinatal population are associated with high mortality and morbidity. We examined trends of behavioral health conditions and treatment received by perinatal Medicaid beneficiaries and described the characteristics of providers treat-ing these beneficiaries from 2017 to 2022. Results indicated that 24.4% of beneficiaries had a behav-ioral health diagnosis, 13.8% received a psycho-tropic prescription, and 7.1% received a behavioral health service.",
