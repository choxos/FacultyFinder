  "title": "In vitro comparative study of multimodal imaging nano-assembled microspheres with two clinical drug-eluting beads loaded with doxorubicin.",
  "abstract": "DC Beads and CalliSpheres are commonly used microspheres in clinical transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, but these microspheres cannot be visualized by themselves. Therefore, in our previous study, we developed multimodal imaging nano-assembled microspheres (NAMs), which are visualized under CT/MR and the location of embolic microspheres can be determined during postoperative review, facilitating the evaluation of embolic areas and guiding subsequent treatment. Moreover, the NAMs can be carried with positively and negatively charged drugs, increasing the choice of drugs. Systematic comparative analysis of the pharmacokinetics of NAMs with commercially available DC Bead and CalliSpheres microspheres is important for evaluating the clinical application of NAMs. In our study, we compared the similarities and differences between NAMs and two drug-eluting beads (DEBs) in respect to drug loading capacity, drug release profiles, diameter variation and morphological characteristics. The results indicate that NAMs had good drug delivery and release characteristics as well as DC Bead and CalliSpheres in vitro experimental stage. Therefore, NAMs have a good application prospect in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.",
