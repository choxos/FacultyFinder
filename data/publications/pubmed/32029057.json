  "title": "Effects of Incretin-based Therapies on Weight-related Indicators among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Network Meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of incretin-based therapies on body weight as the primary outcome, as well as on body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) as secondary outcomes. METHODS: Databases including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Standard pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were both carried out. The risk of bias (ROB) tool recommended by the Cochrane handbook was used to assess the quality of studies. Subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, meta-regression, and quality evaluation based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) were also performed. RESULTS: A total of 292 trials were included in this study. Compared with placebo, dipeptidyl-peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-4Is) increased weight slightly by 0.31 kg [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.05, 0.58] and had negligible effects on BMI and WC. Compared with placebo, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) lowered weight, BMI, and WC by -1.34 kg (95% CI: -1.60, -1.09), -1.10 kg/m [2] (95% CI: -1.42, -0.78), and -1.28 cm (95% CI: -1.69, -0.86), respectively. CONCLUSION: GLP-1 RAs were more effective than DPP-4Is in lowering the three indicators. Overall, the effects of GLP-1 RAs on weight, BMI, and WC were favorable.",
