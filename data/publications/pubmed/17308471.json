  "abstract": "Metastatic disease of the acetabulum is a common and challenging surgical problem. We asked whether acetabular reconstruction for metastatic bone disease improves functional outcome with an acceptable risk of surgical morbidity. We also asked if primary tumor type and the presence of visceral metastases predicted patient survival. We analyzed prospectively accumulated records of 62 consecutive patients who underwent 63 hip arthroplasties with acetabular reconstruction. Operative technique was guided by the extent of dome and column involvement. Demographics, functional status in the form of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score, and survival data were analyzed. Functional scores improved from an average of 2.6 preoperatively to 1.1 postoperatively. Four patients had postoperative complications for which we performed further surgery. Mean survival for the patients with breast cancer was longer at 21 months compared to 9 months for the patients with other primary malignancies. Patients who did not present with visceral metastases had longer survival than those with visceral metastases. Despite the moderate risk of operative complications, an anatomically based approach to reconstruction of acetabular defects from metastatic disease improves functional outcome. Breast cancer as the primary malignancy and the absence of visceral metastases predicted longer survival.",
