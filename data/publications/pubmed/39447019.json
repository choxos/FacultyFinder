  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to investigate the association between triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-c), triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), and related parameters (TyG-BMI, TyG-WC) with prehypertension and hypertension over 45 years old. According to the blood pressure diagnosis, the enrolled individuals were divided into two groups, which were prehypertension and hypertension. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for confounders, the highest quartile groups of TG/HDL-c, TyG, and related parameters showed a significantly increased risk of hypertension compared to the lowest quartile groups, and there was associated with hypertension when comparing the highest TG/HDL-c to the lowest TG/HDL-c and corresponding ORs were 1.416 (1.234, 1.625) and 1.029 (0.893, 1.187), respectively. Furthermore, when comparing the fourth quartile to the first quartile of TG/HDL-c, TyG index, and related parameters, respectively, both corresponding ORs of hypertension were higher than prehypertension. Elevated TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC index, and TG/HDL-c ratio levels were associated with hypertension in individuals over 45 years. Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to compare the predictive ability of each parameter in identifying people with hypertension suggested that the TyG-WC index ([Area under the curve] AUC: 0.601 [CI: 0.588-0.615]), TyG-BMI, and TyG were more significant than TG/HDL-c in distinguishing hypertension. However, in the prehypertension population, the area under the ROC curve for TyG-BMI (0.543 [CI: 0.530-0.556]) was better than that of other parameters. They have the potential to become cost-effective monitors in the hierarchical management of hypertension.",
