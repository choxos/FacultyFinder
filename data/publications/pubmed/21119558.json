  "title": "Disseminated intravascular large B cell lymphoma with slowly decreasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",
  "abstract": "Intravascular large B cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare type of extranodal large B cell lymphoma in the lumina of small vessels. Low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is associated with sepsis, malignancy, and death. Recent evidence suggests an inverse relationship between HDL-C and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. We report the case of a 71-year-old female who presented with decreasing HDL-C for years prior to diagnosis of IVLBCL. The patient developed nonspecific symptoms, including dizziness, gait instability, fatigue, tinnitus, and weight loss. Although malignancy was high on the differential, no diagnosis was made antemortem. The diagnosis of disseminated intravascular large B cell lymphoma was made postmortem in multiple organ systems. The presentation of IVLBCL is nonspecific and misleading. To our knowledge this is the second known case report of low HDL-C preceding diagnosis of IVLBCL, but the first case documenting low HDL-C years prior to diagnosis.",
