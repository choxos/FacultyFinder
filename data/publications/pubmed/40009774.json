  "title": "Isolated Glucosuria in Adolescence and Early-Onset Diabetes: A Nationwide Cohort Study of 1.6 Million Adolescents.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We assess diabetes risk in adulthood among adolescents with isolated glucosuria. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Included were adolescents (16-19 years) examined before military service between 1993 and 2015. Data were linked with the Israeli National Diabetes Registry. Glucosuria was confirmed following normal renal function and glucose tolerance tests. Cox models were applied. RESULTS: The study included 1,611,467 adolescents, of whom 755 (0.05%) had glucosuria. The latter group had a higher proportion of males (75% vs. 57%) and a lower proportion of BMI â‰¥ 85th percentile (10.4% vs. 16.3%) compared with nonglucosuric (all P < 0.001). During follow-up, 10,328 diabetes cases were recorded with an incidence rate of 87.5 and 43.3 per 100,000 person-years for those with versus without glucosuria, respectively. Individuals with glucosuria had an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.17 (95% CI, 1.17-4.04) for diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Glucosuria in adolescents is associated with an increased risk of early-onset diabetes.",
