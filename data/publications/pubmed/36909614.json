  "title": "Transcriptional buffering and 3'UTR lengthening are shaped during human neurodevelopment by shifts in mRNA stability and microRNA load.",
  "abstract": "The contribution of mRNA half-life is commonly overlooked when examining changes in mRNA abundance during development. mRNA levels of some genes are regulated by transcription rate only, but others may be regulated by mRNA half-life only shifts. Furthermore, transcriptional buffering is predicted when changes in transcription rates have compensating shifts in mRNA half-life resulting in no change to steady-state levels. Likewise, transcriptional boosting should result when changes in transcription rate are accompanied by amplifying half-life shifts. During neurodevelopment there is widespread 3'UTR lengthening that could be shaped by differential shifts in the stability of existing short or long 3'UTR transcript isoforms. We measured transcription rate and mRNA half-life changes during induced human Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC)-derived neuronal development using RATE-seq. During transitions to progenitor and neuron stages, transcriptional buffering occurred in up to 50%, and transcriptional boosting in up to 15%, of genes with changed transcription rates. The remaining changes occurred by transcription rate only or mRNA half-life only shifts. Average mRNA half-life decreased two-fold in neurons relative to iPSCs. Short gene isoforms were more destabilized in neurons and thereby increased the average 3'UTR length. Small RNA sequencing captured an increase in microRNA copy number per cell during neurodevelopment. We propose that mRNA destabilization and 3'UTR lengthening are driven in part by an increase in microRNA load in neurons. Our findings identify mRNA stability mechanisms in human neurodevelopment that regulate gene and isoform level abundance and provide a precedent for similar post-transcriptional regulatory events as other tissues develop.",
