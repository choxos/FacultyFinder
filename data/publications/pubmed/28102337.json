  "abstract": "Myoclonus-dystonia syndrome (MDS) is a rare autosomal dominant inherited disorder characterized by the presentation of both myoclonic jerks and dystonia. Evidence is emerging that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be a promising treatment for MDS. However, there are no studies reporting the effects of DBS on MDS with double mutations in DYT1 and DYT11. Two refractory MDS patients with double mutations were treated between 2011 and 2015 in our center. Genetic testing for DYT1 and DYT11 was performed through polymerase chain reaction amplification and direct sequencing of the specific exons of genes. For the first patient, initial bilateral ventral intermediate thalamus nucleus (Vim) DBS was performed. Because of worsening dystonia after initial improvement in symptoms, subsequent bilateral globus pallidus internus (GPi) DBS was offered at 43 months after initial surgery, which reversed the deterioration and restored the motor function. For the second patient, initial improvement in motor symptoms and quality of life was sustained at the follow-up 6 months after bilateral Vim DBS treatment. Thus, DBS may be an effective therapeutic option for MDS, even in patients with double mutations. Moreover, GPi DBS may be used as a supplementary treatment when initial Vim DBS fails to control MDS symptoms.",
