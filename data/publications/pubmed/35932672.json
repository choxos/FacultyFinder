  "title": "Controllable construction of multifunctional superhydrophobic coating with ultra-stable efficiency for oily water treatment.",
  "abstract": "Designing interfacial coating with tailored characteristics is a crucial step in regulating the wetting properties of oil/water separation materials; however, the controllable fabrication of multifunctional layer with long-term durability in harsh environments remains challenging. Fabrication of raised dots based on magnetic Fe3O4 particles on micro-nanometer units, inspired by mussel chemistry, under the adhesion behavior of dopamine (DA) self-polymerization covalent deposition of Fe3O4 particles and hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) modification to synthesize magnetic superhydrophobic cotton composites (Cotton-P). Due to the unique magnetic and superhydrophobic surface composition, the synthetic Cotton-P possesses superhydrophobic (155.4Â°) and magnetic properties and still exhibits these excellent properties after 10 cycles. In addition, the hydrophobicity of magnetic monolithic cotton is virtually unaffected in harsh environments. The chemical/thermal stability of the Cotton-P composite is improved due to the rigid silane coating on the skeleton. Moreover, the Cotton-P revealed excellent oil/water separation efficiency of over 98 % after 10 cycles. Based on these outstanding properties, Cotton-P has the potential to develop in the treatment of oil-water mixtures.",
