  "title": "Evidence informing the intersection of HIV, aging and health: a scoping review.",
  "abstract": "The growing number of people over age 50 with HIV requires research, policy, and practice to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the health consequences of HIV in older individuals. We conducted a scoping review of peer-reviewed and grey literature published since 1996 to explore the impacts of aging on the health of older people with HIV (50 years or older). We included 209 studies (two systematic reviews, 174 quantitative studies, 28 qualitative studies, and five mixed methods studies). Health topics addressed include: HIV- and aging-related comorbidities, disease progression, neurocognitive functioning, mental health conditions, psychological well-being, social supports, stigma, antiretroviral adherence, health care utilization/access, and sexual risk behaviour. We recommend that future research takes a broader view of health, looks at aging from a strength-based perspective and examines the issue using diverse perspectives (i.e., geographic location, multiple methods, time of diagnosis, time on antiretroviral therapy (ART), demographic diversity).",
