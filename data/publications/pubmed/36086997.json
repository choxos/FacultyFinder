  "title": "A chromosome-level assembly of the widely used Rockefeller strain of Aedes aegypti, the yellow fever mosquito.",
  "abstract": "Aedes aegypti is the vector of important human diseases, and genomic resources are crucial in facilitating the study of A. aegypti and its ecosystem interactions. Several laboratory-acclimated strains of this mosquito have been established, but the most used strain in toxicology studies is \"Rockefeller,\" which was originally collected and established in Cuba 130 years ago. A full-length genome assembly of another reference strain, \"Liverpool,\" was published in 2018 and is the reference genome for the species (AaegL5). However, genetic studies with the Rockefeller strain are complicated by the availability of only the Liverpool strain as the reference genome. Differences between Liverpool and Rockefeller have been known for decades, particularly in the expression of genes relevant to mosquito behavior and vector control (e.g. olfactory). These differences indicate that AaegL5 is likely not fully representative of the Rockefeller genome, presenting potential impediments to research. Here, we present a chromosomal-level assembly and annotation of the Rockefeller genome and a comparative characterization vs the Liverpool genome. Our results set the stage for a pan-genomic approach to understanding evolution and diversity within this important disease vector.",
