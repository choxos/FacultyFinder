  "title": "Ocular Metastasis in Elderly Lung Cancer Patients: Potential Risk Factors of CA-125, CA-153 and TPSA.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: At present, little is known regarding the specific risk factors of ocular metastasis (OM) in elderly patients with lung cancer. This study aimed to find out the risk factors of ocular metastasis. METHODS: A total of 1615 elderly patients with lung cancer were recruited into this retrospective study between April 2001 and July 2016. These patients were divided into two groups, namely OM and non-ocular metastasis (NOM). Student's t-tests, nonparametric rank sum tests, and Chi-square tests were applied to describe whether there were significant differences between the OM group and NOM group. We compared a range of serum biomarkers between the two groups of patients, including alkaline phosphatase, calcium, hemoglobin, alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA-125, CA-199, CA-153, CA-724, cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA21-1), TPSA and neuron specific enolase (NSE). We used binary logistic regression analysis to determine the risk factors and receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses to assess the diagnostic value for OM in CRC patients. RESULTS: The incidence of OM in elderly patients with lung cancer was 2.0%. Binary logistic regression indicated that CA-125, CA-153, and total prostate specific antigen (TPSA) were identified as independent risk factors of OM in patients with lung cancer (P<0.001, P<0.001, and P=0.003, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity of OM diagnosis were as follows: CA-125, 81.25% and 81.57%; CA-153, 68.75% and 83.78%; and TPSA, 81.25% and 90.03%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The serum concentrations of CA-125, CA-153, and TPSA have predictive value in the diagnosis of OM in elderly patients with lung cancer.",
