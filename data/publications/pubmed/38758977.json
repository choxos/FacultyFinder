  "title": "Association Between Infectious Diseases Consultation and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Gram-negative Bloodstream Infection: A Retrospective Population-wide Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Data supporting routine infectious diseases (ID) consultation in gram-negative bloodstream infection (GN-BSI) are limited. We evaluated the association between ID consultation and mortality in patients with GN-BSI in a retrospective population-wide cohort study in Ontario using linked health administrative databases. METHODS: Hospitalized adult patients with GN-BSI between April 2017 and December 2021 were included. The primary outcome was time to all-cause mortality censored at 30 days, analyzed using a mixed effects Cox proportional hazards model with hospital as a random effect. ID consultation 1-10 days after the first positive blood culture was treated as a time-varying exposure. RESULTS: Of 30 159 patients with GN-BSI across 53 hospitals, 11 013 (36.5%) received ID consultation. Median prevalence of ID consultation for patients with GN-BSI across hospitals was 35.0% with wide variability (range 2.7%-76.1%, interquartile range 19.6%-41.1%). In total, 1041 (9.5%) patients who received ID consultation died within 30 days, compared to 1797 (9.4%) patients without ID consultation. In the fully adjusted multivariable model, ID consultation was associated with mortality benefit (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] .77-.88, P < .0001; translating to absolute risk reduction of -3.8% or number needed to treat [NNT] of 27). Exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary outcome showed that ID consultation could have greater benefit in patients with high-risk features (nosocomial infection, polymicrobial or non-Enterobacterales infection, antimicrobial resistance, or non-urinary tract source). CONCLUSIONS: Early ID consultation was associated with reduced mortality in patients with GN-BSI. If resources permit, routine ID consultation for this patient population should be considered to improve patient outcomes.",
