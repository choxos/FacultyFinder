  "title": "Antimicrobial stewardship programs in a network of Canadian acute care hospitals: a cross-sectional survey.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Antibiotics are essential to combating infections; however, misuse and overuse has contributed to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are a strategy to combat AMR and are mandatory in Canadian hospitals for accreditation. The Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program (CNISP) sought to capture a snapshot of ASP practices within the network of Canadian acute care hospitals. Objectives of the survey were to describe the status, practices, and process indicators of ASPs across acute care hospitals participating in CNISP. DESIGN: The survey explored the following items related to ASP programs: 1) program structure and leadership, 2) human, technical and financial resources allocated, 3) inventory of interventions carried and implemented, 4) tracking antimicrobial use; and 5) educational and promotional components. METHODS: CNISP developed a 34-item survey in both English and French. The survey was administered to 109 participating CNISP hospitals from June to August 2024, responses were analyzed descriptively. RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent (106/109) of CNISP hospitals responded to the survey. Eighty-four percent (89/106) reported having a formal ASP in place at the time of the study. Ninety percent (80/89) of acute care hospitals with an ASP performed prospective audit and feedback for antibiotic agents and 85% (76/89) had formal surveillance of quantitative antimicrobial use. Additionally, just over 80% (74/89) provided education to their prescribers and other healthcare staff. CONCLUSIONS: CNISP acute care hospitals employ multiple key aspects of ASP including implementing interventions and monitoring/tracking antimicrobial use. There were acute care hospitals without an ASP, highlighting areas for investigation and improvement.",
