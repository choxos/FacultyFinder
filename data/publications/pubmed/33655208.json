  "title": "Single-cell mapper (scMappR): using scRNA-seq to infer the cell-type specificities of differentially expressed genes.",
  "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is widely used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and reveal biological mechanisms underlying complex biological processes. RNA-seq is often performed on heterogeneous samples and the resulting DEGs do not necessarily indicate the cell-types where the differential expression occurred. While single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) methods solve this problem, technical and cost constraints currently limit its widespread use. Here we present single cell Mapper (scMappR), a method that assigns cell-type specificity scores to DEGs obtained from bulk RNA-seq by leveraging cell-type expression data generated by scRNA-seq and existing deconvolution methods. After evaluating scMappR with simulated RNA-seq data and benchmarking scMappR using RNA-seq data obtained from sorted blood cells, we asked if scMappR could reveal known cell-type specific changes that occur during kidney regeneration. scMappR appropriately assigned DEGs to cell-types involved in kidney regeneration, including a relatively small population of immune cells. While scMappR can work with user-supplied scRNA-seq data, we curated scRNA-seq expression matrices for âˆ¼100 human and mouse tissues to facilitate its stand-alone use with bulk RNA-seq data from these species. Overall, scMappR is a user-friendly R package that complements traditional differential gene expression analysis of bulk RNA-seq data.",
