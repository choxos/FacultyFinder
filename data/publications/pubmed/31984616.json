  "title": "Urologic complications after transplantation of 225 en bloc kidneys from small pediatric donors ≤20 kg: Incidence, management, and impact on graft survival.",
  "abstract": "Pediatric en bloc kidney transplants (EBKs) from small deceased pediatric donors are associated with increased early graft loss and morbidity. Yet, urologic complications post-EBK and their potential impact on graft survival have not been systematically studied. We retrospectively studied urological complications requiring intervention for 225 EBKs performed at our center January 2005 to September 2017 from donors ≤20 kg into recipients ≥18 years. Overall ureteral complication incidence after EBK was 9.8% (n = 22) (12% vs 2% for EBK donors < 10 vs ≥ 10 kg, respectively [P = .031]). The most common post-EBK urologic complication was a stricture (55%), followed by urine leak (41%). In all, 95% of all urologic complications occurred early within 5 months posttransplant (median, 138 days). Urologic complications could be successfully managed nonoperatively in 50% of all cases and had no impact on graft or patient survival. In summary, urologic complications after EBK were common, associated with lower donor weights, occurred early posttransplant, and were often amenable to nonoperative treatment, without adversely affecting survival. We conclude that the higher urologic complication rate after EBK (1) should not prevent increased utilization of small pediatric donor en bloc kidneys for properly selected recipients, and (2) warrants specific discussion with EBK recipients during the preoperative consent process.",
