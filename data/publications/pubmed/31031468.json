  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public health problem associated with an eight- to ten-fold increase in cardiovascular mortality. Among patients with CKD, on drug treatment, we aimed to determine the characteristics, etiology, patterns and rates of drug use, and outcomes and factors determining the outcomes at 6 months. METHODS: We conducted an observational follow-up study on inpatients with CKD at a tertiary care teaching hospital in South India. We collected data on patient characteristics, comorbidities, treatments at baseline, and treatments and outcomes at 6 months. We used Chi-squared tests and Cochran's Q-test to compare categorical variables, t-tests to compare continuous variables, and a multivariable logistic regression analysis to estimate the determinants of the outcome. RESULTS: We recruited 305 patients with the mean age 52.98 (Â±14.89) years, 73.1% were male and 55.4% patients were from a lower-middle socioeconomic background. About 72.1% were in CKD Stage 5 and 37.0% had diabetic nephropathy. Antihypertensives (84.6%) were the most common drug class prescribed, followed by multivitamins (65.2%), proton-pump inhibitors (64.9%), and antidiabetic drugs (32.5%). There was no significant difference in rates of drug use over 6 months. Increased serum creatinine (odds ratio [OR]: 1.29 [1.04, 1.60]; P = 0.017) and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR: 38.23 [3.92, 372.06]; P = 0.002) predicted progression of CKD, and antiplatelets reduced progression (OR: 0.278 [0.09, 0.85]; P = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Diabetic nephropathy was the most common cause of CKD. There was no change in treatments over 6 months. Low eGFR predicted progression and use of antiplatelets reduced progression of CKD. Large multicenter studies are needed to study the variability in patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes to obtain a national picture, and to enable policy changes.",
