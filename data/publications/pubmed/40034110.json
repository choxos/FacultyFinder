  "title": "Cardiovascular disease in the Americas: the epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and its risk factors.",
  "abstract": "This first article of the Series about Cardiovascular Disease in the Americas summarizes the epidemiology of CVD and its risk factors, and population-level strategies in place aimed at CVD prevention. While age-standardized CVD incidence and CV mortality rates have been decreasing across in the Americas since 1990, the annual number of CVD cases and related deaths have increased due to population growth and ageing. The burden of CVD is also slowly transitioning from high-income countries in North America to middle-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Trends in CV risk factor levels have been mixed, with declines in smoking and mean cholesterol counterbalanced by higher prevalence of obesity and diabetes. Population-wide strategies aimed at controlling cardiometabolic risk factors and tobacco use have been implemented with varying degrees of success. There is a need to better implement existing CVD prevention strategies in the region.",
