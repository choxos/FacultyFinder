  "title": "Asthma associated with incontinentia pigmenti and Fanconi anemia: variable airflow limitation without cellular bronchitis.",
  "abstract": "Airway inflammation is considered a central component of asthma and, therefore, international guidelines recommend antiinflammatory medications. We describe the clinical history of a 34-year-old woman with airway hyperresponsiveness and asthma who had a reduced ability to mount an inflammatory response due to two unrelated and rare genetic conditions: Fanconi anemia and incontinentia pigmenti. Absence of eosinophils in blood and sputum led to a successful reduction in the dose of corticosteroids without loss of asthma control demonstrating the clinical utility of monitoring treatment using biomarkers and the importance of recognizing the components of airway diseases that contribute to symptoms.",
