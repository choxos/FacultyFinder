  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In some publications, the terms \"precision\" and \"accuracy\" are used as if they were synonyms for \"reliability\" and \"validity.\" METHODS AND RESULTS: This article shows that these terms are neither precise nor accurate when used in this way. Scales can demonstrate high test-retest or interrater reliability (i.e., they are \"precise\") but still be unreliable in certain circumstances; and \"imprecise\" scales can still show good reliability. Further, \"accuracy\" as a synonym for validity reflects an outdated conceptualization of validity, which has been superseded by one that emphasizes that validity tells us what conclusions can be drawn about a person based on a test result. CONCLUSION: The article ends with a call for the use of the more traditional terms as better reflecting the process of scale development and the uses to which they are put.",
