  "title": "A systematic review of the association between anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies and APS manifestations.",
  "abstract": "Anti-β-2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-B2GPI) are often cited as the major pathogenically relevant antibody in antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), but it is unclear if there is clinical evidence to support this theory. We performed a systematic review to determine if immunoglobulin G anti-B2GPI positivity was independently associated with thrombotic and/or obstetric manifestations of APS. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov electronic databases through April 2020 for prospective studies that met prespecified design criteria. Of 4758 articles identified through computer-assisted search, 4 studies examining obstetric outcomes and 2 studies examining thrombotic outcomes were included for qualitative assessment. The presence of anti-B2GPI had only a weak independent association with thrombosis and was, at best, inconsistently associated with obstetric complications. A quantitative assessment could not be performed because of study heterogeneity. The overall quality of the evidence was very low. Although anti-B2GPI are commonly thought to mediate APS manifestations, clinical evidence is lacking with very low-quality data to support a weak association with thrombosis.",
