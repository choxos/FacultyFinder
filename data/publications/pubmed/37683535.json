  "title": "Cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes induce immunogenic cell death in HepG2 cells via paraptosis.",
  "abstract": "Immunotherapy has been shown to provide superior antitumor efficacy by activating the innate immune system to recognize, attack and eliminate tumor cells without seriously harming normal cells. Herein, we designed and synthesized three new cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes (Ir1, Ir2, Ir3) then evaluated their antitumor activity. When co-incubated with HepG2 cells, the complex Ir1 localized in the lysosome, where it induced paraptosis and endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Notably, Ir1 also induced immunogenic cell death (ICD), promoted dendritic cell maturation that enhanced effector T cell chemotaxis to tumor tissues, down-regulated proportions of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells within tumor tissues and triggered activation of antitumor immunity throughout the body. To date, Ir1 is the first reported iridium(III) complex-based paraptosis inducer to successfully induce tumor cell ICD. Furthermore, Ir1 induced ICD of HepG2 cells without affecting cell cycle or reactive oxygen species levels.",
