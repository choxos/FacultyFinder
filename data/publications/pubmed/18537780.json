  "title": "Predictors of mortality after hip fracture: a 10-year prospective study.",
  "abstract": "The role of medical, social, and functional covariates on mortality after hip fracture was examined over a 16-year period. A total of 1109 patients with hip fractures were included in a prospective database. The inclusion criteria were patients who were age 65 years or older, ambulatory prior to fracture, cognitively intact, living in their own home at the time of the fracture, and had sustained a nonpathological femoral neck or intertrochanteric chip fracture. Data were analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Mortality was compared with a standardized population, and standardized mortality ratios were calculated for 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years,respectively. The 1-, 2-, 5- and 10-year mortality rates were 11.9%, 18.5%, 41.2%, and 75.3%, respectively. The predictors of mortality were advanced age, male gender, high American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA)classification, the presence of a major postoperative complication, a history of cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, a history of congestive heart failure,ambulating with an assistive device, or being a household ambulator prior to hip fracture. The increased mortality risk was highest during the first year after hip fracture and returned to the risk of the standard population 3 years postoperatively. Males who are 65 to 84 years had the highest mortality risk.",
