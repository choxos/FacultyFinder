  "title": "From stigma to the spotlight: A need for patient-centred incontinence care.",
  "abstract": "Incontinence is not a single disorder but a family of related conditions with different etiologies and treatments; it is a chronic disability that carries an enormous stigma. In few disorder/treatment pairings, there is the need to reinvent care more urgent and clear than in the area of incontinence. Patient-centred care has been realized to improve outcomes, quality of care, and patient satisfaction while concurrently reducing healthcare costs. To improve continence care and move it away from \"cleaning up accidents\" to a patient-centred care model, in which the disorder is managed to best practice guidelines, does not require investigative or developmental prowess but a simple, concentrated effort to diffuse existing knowledge to close the knowledge gaps, both at the clinical language level for clinical nurses and family physicians, as the gatekeepers to specialist care, and in simplified layperson's language for the healthcare worker, family carer, and person living with incontinence.",
