  "title": "Combination of sulfamethoxazole and selenium in anticancer therapy: a novel approach.",
  "abstract": "Sulfonamides have been reported to possess substantial antitumor activity as they act as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In addition, selenium appears to have a protective effect at various stages of cancer due to its antioxidant property, enhanced carcinogen detoxification, inhibition of cell invasion, and by inhibiting angiogenesis. Here, in the present study we aimed to evaluate and synergize the cytotoxic activity of sulfonamide and selenium (SM+SE) as effective therapy in the treatment of DENA-induced HCC. Hepatocarcinogeneis was induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) (200 mg/kg) in phosphate buffer. 30 Male Wistar rats used in this study were divided randomly into five equal groups (n = 6). DENA-administered animals showed significant alteration (p < 0.001) in liver-specific enzymes-glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and Alpha fetoproteins (AFP), and also induced severe histopathological changes in the hepatic tissues. Interestingly, treatment with (SE+SE) (SM 30 mg/kg + SE 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001) the elevated AFP, SGOT, SGPT, and ALP levels, respectively, suggesting that combination therapy of SM+SE has a potential to treat DENA-induced liver damage.",
