  "title": "Rational Engineering of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 as Live Biotherapeutic to Degrade Uremic Toxin Precursors.",
  "abstract": "Uremic toxins (UTs) are microbiota-derived metabolites that accelerate the progression of kidney damage in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). One of the major UTs involved in CKD progression is p-cresol-sulfate (PCS), derived from dietary l-tyrosine (l-Tyr). Here, we engineered a probiotic strain of Escherichia coli Nissle 1917, to convert l-Tyr to the nontoxic compound p-coumaric acid via tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL). First, a small metagenomic library was assessed to identify the TAL with the greatest whole-cell activity. Second, accessory genes implicated in the import of l-Tyr and export of PCA were overexpressed to enhance l-Tyr degradation by 106% and 56%, respectively. Last, random mutagenesis coupled to a novel selection and screening strategy was developed that identified a TAL variant with a 25% increase in whole-cell activity. Taken together, the final strain exhibits a 183% improvement over initial whole-cell activity and provides a promising candidate to degrade l-Tyr mediated PCS accumulation.",
