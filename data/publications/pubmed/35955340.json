  "title": "Photoactive Cements: A Review.",
  "abstract": "This article presents a short overview of modified cements with photocatalytic activity. First, the types and three main methods of obtaining photoactive cements are presented. The most frequently used modification method is the incorporation of a photocatalyst into the total mass of the cement. The second group analyzed is cements obtained by applying a thin layer of photoactive materials, e.g., paints, enamels, or TiO2 suspensions, using various techniques. The third group is cement mortars with a thick layer of photoactive concrete on the top. In addition, methods for determining the photoactivity of cement composites, mechanical properties, and physicochemical parameters of such materials are briefly presented. Finally, examples of investments with the use of photoactive cements and development prospects are shown.",
