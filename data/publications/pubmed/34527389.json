  "title": "Improving the Workplace Experience of Caregiver-Employees: A Time-Series Analysis of a Workplace Intervention.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rapid population aging in developed countries has resulted in the working-age population increasingly being tasked with the provision of informal care. METHODS: An educational intervention was delivered to 21 carer-employees employed at a Canadian University. Work role function, job security, schedule control, work-family conflict, familywork conflict, and supervisor and coworker support were measured as part of an aggregated workplace experience score. This score was used to measure changes pre/post intervention and at a follow-up period approximately 12 months post intervention. Three random intercept models were created via linear mixed modeling to illustrate changes in participants' workplace experience across time. RESULTS: All three models reported statistically significant random and fixed effects intercepts, with a positive coefficient of change. CONCLUSION: This suggests that the intervention demonstrated an improvement of the workplace experience score for participants over time, with the association particularly strong immediately after intervention.",
