  "abstract": "Morbid obesity is considered a relative contraindication for liver transplantation (LTX) because of increased risk of complications. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of bariatric surgery before, during, and after LTX. A systematic review of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and PubMed databases was performed for studies investigating bariatric surgery in patients before, during, or after LTX. Random-effects meta-analysis of proportions was used to calculate pooled effect estimates. One hundred eighty-seven patients underwent bariatric surgery before LTX (8 studies). After surgery, 82% (95% confidence interval, 62%-97%) of patients were successfully listed for LTX and 70% (95% confidence interval, 40%-93%) successfully received LTX. The 30-day mortality rate was 0%. The graft survival rate after 1 year was 70% (95% confidence interval, 30%-99%). Thirty-day minor and major complications rate was 4% and 1%, respectively. Thirty-two patients underwent bariatric surgery during LTX (2 studies). The 30-day mortality rate after surgery was 0% and 1-year graft survival was 100%. Sixty-four patients underwent bariatric surgery after LTX (9 studies). The 30-day mortality was 0%, but 5 deaths occurred beyond 30 days (7.8%). Bariatric surgery may be safe and feasible as a bridge to LTX for patients who would otherwise be ineligible and post-LTX patients for weight loss.",
