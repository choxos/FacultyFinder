  "title": "Peanut allergy: Beyond the oral immunotherapy plateau.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are a lack of disease-modifying treatments for peanut allergy, which is lifelong in most instances. Oral immunotherapy has remained at the forefront of prospective treatments, though its efficacy is consistently undermined by the risk of adverse reactions and meager sustained effects. AIM: This review discusses the current state of oral immunotherapy, its strengths and limitations, and the future of therapeutics for the treatment of peanut allergy. CONCLUSION: The persistence of peanut allergy is currently attributed to reservoirs of peanut-specific memory B cells and Th2 cells, though the cellular and molecular interplay that facilitates the replenishment of peanut-specific IgE remains elusive. Uncovering these events will prove critical for identification of novel targets as we forge ahead to a new age of peanut allergy treatment with biotherapeutics.",
