  "title": "Physician-Rating Websites and Social Media Usage: A Global Survey of Academic Orthopaedic Surgeons: AOA Critical Issues.",
  "abstract": "The relationship between orthopaedic surgeons and the internet is complicated. Social media allows surgeons to educate their patients while marketing to them at the same time. Conversely, patients are able to better communicate with their surgeons while anonymously rating their service and expertise. This study aims to look at the complex relationship between surgeons and social media use.",
