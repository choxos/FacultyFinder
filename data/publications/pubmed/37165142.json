  "title": "A comparative analysis of carer-employees in Canada over time: a cross-sectional analysis of Canada's General Social Survey, 2012 and 2018.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study are to identify trends in the socio-demographic, health, and work profiles of Canadian carer-employees (CEs) over time, as well as the gender difference in the intensity of caring. METHODS: Cross-sectional data from cycles 26 and 32, collected in 2012 and 2018 respectively, of the Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) were used. Logistic, multinomial logistic, and linear regressions were used to estimate how caregiving is associated with caregivers' health, well-being, and work in both cycles. Regressions from both cycles were then compared with chi-square tests for significant differences over time. RESULTS: The proportion of male CEs grew between 2012 and 2018, and women were no longer more likely to be a CE. The intensity of care for female CEs was significantly increased from 2012 to 2018 as compared with their male counterparts. General health (2018: OR = 0.25[0.11, 0.61] vs. 2012: OR = 0.33[0.15, 0.72]) and life satisfaction ([Formula: see text] = -0.42[0.54, -0.30] vs. [Formula: see text] = -0.22[-0.30, -0.14]) were significantly worsened with respect to the role of CEs from 2012 to 2018. CONCLUSION: Our study provides the evidence that CEs' health and well-being have worsened over time, especially for female CEs, indicating that the needs of CEs are growing at a faster rate than the supports available. The results are meaningful in informing and justifying the provision of CE supports at work in order to sustain CEs in the workplace, such as the carer-friendly workplace policies.",
