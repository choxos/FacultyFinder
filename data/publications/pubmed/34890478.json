  "title": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 Outcomes Among Recipients of Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibodies for Immune-Mediated Diseases: A Comparative Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients with immune-mediated diseases treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies may have worse coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outcomes due to impaired humoral immunity, but differences compared with the general population are unknown. METHODS: We identified patients with immune-mediated diseases who received anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies within 1 year prior to the index date of polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 between January 31, 2020, and January 31, 2021. General population comparators with COVID-19 were matched up 5:1 by age, sex, and polymerase chain reaction date. Unadjusted and multivariable adjusted (for age, race, body mass index, and Charlson Comorbidity Index) hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and death in recipients of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies versus comparators were estimated by using Cox regression. RESULTS: We identified 114 cases patients COVID-19 who had received anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for immune-mediated diseases (mean age 55 years, 70% female) and 559 matched comparators with COVID-19 (mean age 54 years, 70% female). Patients treated with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies had higher mortality (adjusted HR 2.16; 95% CI: 1.03-4.54) than matched comparators. Risks of hospitalization (adjusted HR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.62-1.26) and mechanical ventilation use (adjusted HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.36-1.87) were similar. Similar trends were seen in analyses according to type of indication (eg, rheumatic or neurologic disease) and duration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody use (<1 or ≥1 year) and after patients with interstitial lung disease, those with cancer, and those on glucocorticoids prior to COVID-19 diagnosis were excluded. CONCLUSION: Patients who received anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies for immune-mediated diseases prior to COVID-19 had higher mortality following COVID-19 than matched comparators, highlighting the urgent need to mitigate excess risks in recipients of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies during the ongoing pandemic.",
