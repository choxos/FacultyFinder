  "abstract": "A 27-year-old man with a complaint of headache, tinnitus, and visual obscuration presented to a neurologist. Neurologic evaluations, including MRI and CT scan, were within normal limit. The prescribed medicines were propranolol, sumatriptin, valproate sodium, and dexamethasone. Ophthalmic examination was associated with reduction of visual acuity of eyes, bilateral uveitis, and serous retinal detachment. The most probable diagnosis was Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. Prescribing high-dose oral steroid and acetazolamide-improved systemic and ocular symptoms. Although HLAB(5) is positive in BehÎ·et disease, it also may be seen in VKH.",
