  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: XTEND (NCT03939767) is a multicenter, observational, prospective study of patients with treatment-naïve neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) in routine clinical practice. The study aims to examine treatment outcomes of proactive intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) treatment regimens (fixed dosing or treat-and-extend) according to local marketing labels. METHODS: Study eyes received IVT-AFL injections as per the local label. The mean changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfield thickness (CST) from baseline to month (M) 12 and M24 were measured and stratified by baseline factors. Treatment exposure and safety data were evaluated. Statistical analysis was descriptive. RESULTS: Overall, 1466 patients from 17 countries were treated. For the overall population, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) age was 78.7 ± 8.5 (range 50-100) years, and 891 patients (60.8%) were female. The mean ± SD baseline BCVA was 54.3 ± 20.3 letters and CST was 374 ± 126 µm. At M12 and M24, mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) BCVA change was + 4.3 (3.4, 5.3) and + 2.3 (1.3, 3.3) letters, respectively. Mean (95% CI) CST was - 106 (- 114, - 99) μm and - 109 (- 117, - 102) μm at M12 and M24, respectively. At M24, 41.5% of patients had a BCVA ≥ 70 letters. Patients received a mean ± SD of 7.7 ± 2.7 injections by M12 and 10.8 ± 5.0 injections by M24 (3.1 injections between M12 and M24). Adverse events were consistent with the known safety profile of IVT-AFL. CONCLUSION: The 24-month results indicate that, in routine clinical practice, a proactive IVT-AFL regimen achieves functional improvements in patients with treatment-naïve nAMD. The proportion of patients achieving ≥ 70 letters at M24 increased, and patients with baseline BCVA ≥ 70 letters maintained vision regardless of the followed IVT-AFL label.
