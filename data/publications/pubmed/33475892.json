  "title": "Photoelectronic Properties of End-bonded InAsSb Nanowire Array Detector under Weak Light.",
  "abstract": "A simple fabrication of end-bonded contacts InAsSb NW (nanowire) array detector to weak light is demonstrated in this study. The detector is fabricated using InAsSb NW array grown by molecular beam epitaxy on GaAs substrate. The metal-induced gap states are induced by the end-bonded contact which suppresses the dark current at various temperatures. The existence of the interface dipole due to the interfacial gap states enhances the light excitation around the local field and thus upgrades the photoresponsivity and photodetectivity to the weak light. The light intensity of the infrared light source in this report is 14 nW/cm[2] which is about 3 to 4 orders of magnitude less than the laser source. The responsivity of the detector has reached 28.57 A/W at room temperature with the light (945 nm) radiation, while the detectivity is 4.81 × 10[11] cm·Hz[1/2] W[-1]. Anomalous temperature-dependent performance emerges at the variable temperature experiments, and we discussed the detailed mechanism behind the nonlinear relationship between the photoresponse of the device and temperatures. Besides, the optoelectronic characteristics of the detector clarified that the light-trapping effect and photogating effect of the NWs can enhance the photoresponse to the weak light across ultraviolet to near-infrared. These results highlight the feasibility of the InAsSb NW array detector to the infrared weak light without a cooling system.",
