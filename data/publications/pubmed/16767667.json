  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship of associating the polymorphisms of CYP11B2 -344C/T and Hind III restriction site on Y chromosome with essential hypertension. METHODS: This study enrolled 654 patients with essential hypertension and 386 healthy subjects as control group. The genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes. The DNA segments of CYP11B2 and Y chromosome were amplified from genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were digested with Hae III or Hind III at 37 degrees centigrade respectively. The digested products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and stain with ethidium bromide. RESULTS: (1)The Hind III (-) genotype was found at 42.0% for patients with essential hypertension and 32.9% for control. The Hind III (-) genotype frequency of hypertension patient was significantly higher than that of the control (P was 0.03). The Hind III (+) genotype had a lower SBP and DBP than the Hind III (-) genotype (P was 0.01, P was 0.03). (2)With combining CC or CT genotype with Hind III (-) genotype, the relative risk suffering from hypertension was 1.998 fold high (P was 0.01). CONCLUSION: The polymorphism of Hind III restriction site on Y chromosome is associated with essential hypertension, and when combined with polymorphism of CYP11B2 -344C/T, may have a united role to increase the risk of suffering from hypertension disease.",
