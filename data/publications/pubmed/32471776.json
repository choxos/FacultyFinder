  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of older adults with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. Our study aimed to understand the changes that occurred in geriatric domains and quality of life parameters as older adults underwent treatment for MM over 6-months following initial diagnosis. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of 40 adults aged ≥65 with newly-diagnosed MM who completed the Cancer and Aging Research Group geriatric assessment and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (General and subscale Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity) quality of life tool at baseline and at 6 months following treatment initiation. RESULTS: Thirty-six participants completed 6-months of follow-up. There was no significant change in geriatric domains, including dependence in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). Compared to baseline, mental health improved at 6-months of follow-up (Mental Health Inventory-17 score, median 77.1 versus 84.3 at baseline and 6-months respectively, p < .001). Objective physical performance as measured by the Timed Up and Go test showed a trend towards improvement (12.3 versus 11.0 s, p = .057) and remained stable or improved in almost all (30/32, 93.8%) of the adults using the minimum clinically important difference threshold. CONCLUSION: From baseline to 6-months of follow-up, older adults with MM showed improvement in mental health but otherwise remained stable with regards to function and overall quality of life. Timed Up and Go Test may provide a dynamic indicator of functional status and needs to be further evaluated in future studies.",
