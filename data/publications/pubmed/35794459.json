  "abstract": "Global control of hookworm infections relies on periodic Mass Drug Administration of benzimidazole drugs to high-risk groups, regardless of infection status. Mutations in the isotype-1 β-tubulin gene have been identified in veterinary nematodes, resulting in structural changes and reduced drug-binding. In Ghana, previous studies have demonstrated significant variability in albendazole effectiveness among people infected with the hookworm Necator americanus, although the mechanisms underlying deworming response have not been defined. Using hookworm egg samples from a cross-sectional study in Ghana, we developed a multiplex amplicon deep sequencing (MAD-seq) method to screen genomic regions encapsulating putative drug-resistance markers in N. americanus isotype-1 β-tubulin gene. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) corresponding to resistance-associated mutations (F167Y, E198A, F200Y) within the coding region of the isotype-1 β-tubulin gene were characterized using MAD-seq in 30 matched pre- and post-treatment samples from individuals with persistent infection following therapy. Post-sequence analysis showed that the highest mean alternative nucleotide allele at each PCR amplicon was 0.034% (167amplicon) and 0.025% (198/200amplicon), suggesting minimal allelic variation. No samples contained the F167Y SNP, while one contained low-frequency reads associated with E198A (3.15%) and F200Y (3.13%). This MAD-seq method provides a highly sensitive tool to monitor the three putative benzimidazole resistance markers at individual and community levels. Further work is required to understand the association of these polymorphisms to treatment response.",
