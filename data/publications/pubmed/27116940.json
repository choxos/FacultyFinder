  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between arterial access site choice (radial versus femoral) and clinical outcomes among STEMI patients undergoing routine PCI after fibrinolysis. METHODS: Patient-level data from trials of STEMI patients evaluating routine PCI after fibrinolysis were included. The primary endpoint was 30-day major bleeding; secondary endpoints included 30-day death and re-infarction. RESULTS: 1891 patients underwent PCI (trans-radial n=338, trans-femoral n=1553). Trans-radial PCI patients were less likely to be >75years (2% vs. 8%, p=0.0001), heavier (median weight 82 [72-90] vs. 80 [70-90] kg, p=0.0013) and more likely in Killip class I at presentation (87% vs. 82%, p=0.03). At 30days, trans-radial PCI was associated with a similar unadjusted risk for major bleeding (3.7% vs. 1.2%, Odds Ratio [OR] 0.43 [95% CI 0.13-1.48], p=0.18), mortality (3.4% vs. 1.2%, OR 0.34 [0.09-1.28], p=0.11) and re-infarction (3.9% vs. 4.7%, OR 1.25 [0.60-2.58], p=0.56). In multivariable analysis, radial access was associated with similar estimates for bleeding and death/reinfarction risk. CONCLUSIONS: In STEMI patients treated with fibrinolysis and undergoing an early routine invasive strategy, radial compared to femoral PCI is chosen in younger, less ill patients and is independently associated with similar risk of bleeding, re-infarction, and mortality. SUMMARY: This study evaluated the relationship between arterial access choice (radial versus femoral) and in-hospital and 30-day outcomes in patients undergoing routine PCI after fibrinolysis for STEMI. We included patient-level data from trials evaluating a strategy of routine PCI after fibrinolysis for STEMI. Of 1891 patients undergoing PCI, trans-radial access (n=338) was chosen in younger, lower risk patients. At 30days, trans-radial access was associated with a similar unadjusted and adjusted risk of major bleeding, re-infarction and mortality.",
