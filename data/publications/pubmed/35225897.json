  "title": "Implementing the Synergy Model: A Qualitative Descriptive Study.",
  "abstract": "Hospitals across our nation are seeking to implement models of care that meet the primary goals of Quadruple Aim: Improved population health, cost-effective care delivery, and patient and provider satisfaction. In an effort to address the Quadruple Aim and our patients' care needs, Hamilton Health Sciences (HHS) embarked on a model of care delivery redesign, beginning with nursing care delivery. From 2013 to 2018, 12 clinical programs at HHS implemented the Synergy Model with its accompanying synergy patient needs assessment tool for nurses to objectively assess patients' acuity and dependency needs. Data on patients' priority care needs were used to inform a nursing model of care redesign at HHS, including skill mix and staffing levels. This five-year project was an organization-wide quality improvement initiative. As part of the evaluation, HHS leaders partnered with health services nurse researchers to conduct a mixed methods study. This paper describes the evaluation outcomes from the qualitative component of the study, which included interviews with clinical nurse leaders and direct care nurses. Data were analyzed using descriptive thematic analysis. Some key findings were increased nurse awareness of patients' holistic care needs and leaders' capacity to plan staffing assignments based on patients' priority care needs. Themes helped inform recommendations for key stakeholders, including nurse leaders and direct care nurses.",
