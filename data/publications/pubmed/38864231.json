  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study sought to elucidate clinical and imaging findings predictive for malperfusion syndrome after blunt thoracic aortic injury (BTAI). BACKGROUND: There is limited literature on malperfusion syndrome after BTAI, and the timing of thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) in patients with this condition has not been defined. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients with BTAI treated between January 2021 and October 2023. Clinical and thoracic aortic (TA) imaging data, time to TEVAR, in-hospital death, and malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae (paraplegia, renal/visceral/limb ischemia, and compartment syndromes) were assessed. Correlations between clinical and imaging findings, time to TEVAR, and outcomes were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 19,203 trauma patients evaluated, 13,717 (71%) had blunt injuries and 77 (0.6%) had BTAI. The majority (67.5%) were male, with a median age of 40 years (IQR: 33-55). TEVAR was performed in 42 (54.5%) patients. Seven (9.1%) patients presented with clinical and TA imaging criteria for traumatic thoracic aortic coarctation (TTAC), including diminished/absent femoral pulses and TA luminal narrowing of 50% to 99%. The median time to TEVAR was 9 (IQR: 5-32), 11, and 4 hours for all non-TTAC and TTAC BTAI patients, respectively (P =0.037). Only TTAC patients presented/developed malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae. In-hospital mortality rates were 7.8%, 5.8%, and 29% for all non-TTAC and TTAC BTAI patients, respectively (P =0.09). Aortic-related mortality occurred in only 2 (2.6%) TTAC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with clinical and TA imaging manifestations of TTAC are predisposed to malperfusion/reperfusion sequelae if TEVAR is delayed. We recommend the emergent repair of all BTAIs with TTAC.",
