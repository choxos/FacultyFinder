  "title": "Left Ventricular Non-Compaction Cardiomyopathy-Still More Questions than Answers.",
  "abstract": "Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) describes the phenotypical phenomena characterized by the presence of excessive trabeculation of the left ventricle which forms a deep recess filled with blood. Considering the lack of a uniform definition of LVNC as well as the \"golden standard\" it is difficult to estimate the actual incidence of the disease, however, seems to be overdiagnosed, due to unspecific diagnostic criteria. The non-compacted myocardium may appear both as a disease representation or variant of the norm or as an adaptive phenomenon. This article covers different approaches to incidence, pathogenesis, diagnostics, and treatment of LVNC as well as recommendations for patients during follow-up.",
