  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiligand receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), osteoprotegerin, and Golgb1 genes may be implicated in atherosclerosis and vascular diseases. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1035798 in RAGE gene, rs2073617 and rs2073618 in TNFRSF11B, and rs3732410 in Golgb1 will be investigated on whether there is an association with hemorrhagic stroke (HS) in Chinese population. METHODS: A total of 600 subjects including 199 HS patients and 401 controls were assayed. These samples were divided into two groups: the ≤50 year and >50 year groups. Genotyping of SNPs was determined using the SEQUENOM MassARRAY matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry. The association between genotype and HS risk was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Our data showed that in the ≤50 year group, the rs1035798 major allele homozygote C/C in RAGE gene was associated with an increased risk of HS, while Golgb1 rs3732410 minor allele homozygote G/G was associated with a decreased risk of HS. In the >50 year group, the major allele homozygote G/G of rs2073618 was found to be associated with an increased risk of HS. CONCLUSIONS: The polymorphisms rs1035798 of RAGE gene, rs2073618 of TNFRSF11B, and rs3732410 of Golgb1 might be involved in the risk of HS at different stage of ages.",
