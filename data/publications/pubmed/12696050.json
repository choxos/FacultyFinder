  "title": "Increased detection of structural templates using alignments of designed sequences.",
  "abstract": "Protein structure prediction by comparative modeling benefits greatly from the use of multiple sequence alignment information to improve the accuracy of structural template identification and the alignment of target sequences to structural templates. Unfortunately, this benefit is limited to those protein sequences for which at least several natural sequence homologues exist. We show here that the use of large diverse alignments of computationally designed protein sequences confers many of the same benefits as natural sequences in identifying structural templates for comparative modeling targets. A large-scale massively parallelized application of an all-atom protein design algorithm, including a simple model of peptide backbone flexibility, has allowed us to generate 500 diverse, non-native, high-quality sequences for each of 264 protein structures in our test set. PSI-BLAST searches using the sequence profiles generated from the designed sequences (\"reverse\" BLAST searches) give near-perfect accuracy in identifying true structural homologues of the parent structure, with 54% coverage. In 41 of 49 genomes scanned using reverse BLAST searches, at least one novel structural template (not found by the standard method of PSI-BLAST against PDB) is identified. Further improvements in coverage, through optimizing the scoring function used to design sequences and continued application to new protein structures beyond the test set, will allow this method to mature into a useful strategy for identifying distantly related structural templates.",
