  "title": "MN-166 (ibudilast) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in a Phase IIb/III study: COMBAT-ALS study design.",
  "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease with motor neuron loss as a defining feature. Despite significant effort, therapeutic breakthroughs have been modest. MN-166 (ibudilast) has demonstrated neuroprotective action by various mechanisms: inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and macrophage migration inhibitory factor, phosphodiesterase inhibition, and attenuation of glial cell activation in models of ALS. Early-phase studies suggest that MN-166 may improve survival outcomes and slow disease progression in patients with ALS. This article describes the rationale and design of COMBAT-ALS, an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase IIb/III study in ALS. This study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability and assess the efficacy of MN-166 on function, muscle strength, quality of life and survival in ALS.",
