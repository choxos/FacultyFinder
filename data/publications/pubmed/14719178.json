  "title": "New anticoagulants.",
  "abstract": "The limitations of heparin and warfarin have prompted the search for new anticoagulants for the prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolism. Although many such agents are in development, only a few have reached phase II or higher levels of clinical testing. This article reviews venous and arterial thrombogenesis, discusses the regulation of coagulation, identifies the molecular targets for new anticoagulants currently under development, describes the agents in more advanced stages of clinical testing, and provides clinical perspective on the opportunities for new anticoagulant drugs.",
