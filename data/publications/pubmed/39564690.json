  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a persistent mental health condition that results in significant individual and economic burden. The uptake of evidence-based treatment is low, with many individuals with GAD citing cost as one of the key barriers. Brief treatments, which are typically more cost effective than standard length treatments, have the potential to make treatment more accessible to patients with GAD. Despite evidence demonstrating the efficacy of brief treatments for a range of anxiety disorders, there are currently no such studies examining brief Internet videoconferencing-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy (VCBT) interventions for patients with diagnosed GAD. The current study aims to examine the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of brief VCBT for GAD. METHOD: The authors adopted an open trial design with 36 participants (77.8% female; Mage = 36.81 years; SD = 12.25) to examine the preliminary efficacy of a brief five-session VCBT intervention delivered remotely. RESULTS: Large pre-treatment to post-treatment effects were seen on the primary outcome measure, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire-7 item (GAD-7; d = 1.13; 95% CI: .62-1.61) and treatment effects increased at 3-month follow-up (d = 1.58; 95% CI: 1.04-2.10). Participants rated the intervention as highly acceptable with 92% reporting that they were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: These results provide preliminary support for the viability of brief remotely delivered CBT treatment in managing GAD symptoms.",
