  "abstract": "The Integrated Management Program Advancing Community Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation (IMPACT-AF) is an investigator designed, prospective, randomized, un-blinded, cluster design clinical trial, conducted in the primary care setting of Nova Scotia, Canada. Its aim is to evaluate whether an electronic Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) designed to assist both practitioners and patients with evidence-based management strategies for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) can improve process of care and outcomes in a cost-efficient manner as compared to usual AF care. At least 200 primary care providers are being recruited and randomized at the level of the practice to control (usual care) or intervention (eligible to access to CDSS) cohorts. Over 1,000 patients of participating providers with confirmed AF will be managed per their provider's respective assignment. The targeted primary clinical outcome is a reduction in the composite of unplanned cardiovascular (CV) or major bleeding hospitalizations and AF-related emergency department visits. Secondary clinical outcomes, process of care, patient and provider satisfaction as well as economic costs at the system and patient levels are being examined. The trial is anticipated to report in 2018.",
