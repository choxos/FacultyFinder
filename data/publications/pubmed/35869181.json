  "title": "Short-term responses of the anammox process to Ni(II): nitrogen removal, mechanisms and inhibition recovery.",
  "abstract": "Anaerobic ammonia oxidizing (anammox) has already been recognized as an innovative and economical nitrogen removal technology. However, the effect of heavy metals on anammox bacteria in aquatic ecosystem remains largely unknown. Ni(II) is a common kind of heavy metals detected in industrial wastewater and municipal sewage treatment plants. Hence, the responses of the anammox process to Ni(II) were studied here. The results showed that anammox was the dominant reaction with Ni(II) concentrations no more than 25 mg/L. 1 mg/L of Ni(II) addition promoted nitrogen removal by anammox. The higher the Ni(II) concentrations and longer exposure time, the more inhibition for anammox bacteria was gotten. The IC50 of Ni(II) to anammox was determined as 83.86 mg/L by an exponential regression equation. The inhibition of Ni(II) on anammox activity was mainly attributed to intracellular accumulation Ni(II) inhibition to HDH activity. Two times increase of IC50 after 4 times circles of domestication suggests multiple intermittent domestication can increase the tolerance of anammox bacteria to Ni(II). EDTA washing can eliminate the inhibition of anammox activity by Ni(II) with Ni(II) addition no more than 25 mg/L.",
