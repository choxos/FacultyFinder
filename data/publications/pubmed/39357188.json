  "title": "Pyroptosis in lung cancer: The emerging role of non-coding RNAs.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains an intractable malignancy worldwide, prompting novel therapeutic modalities. Pyroptosis, a lethal form of programmed cell death featured by inflammation, has been involved in cancer progression and treatment response. Simultaneously, non-coding RNA has been shown to have important roles in coordinating pattern formation and oncogenic pathways, including long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), microRNA (miRNAs), circular RNA (circRNAs), and small interfering RNA (siRNAs). Recent studies have revealed that ncRNAs can promote or inhibit pyroptosis by interacting with key molecular players such as NLRP3, GSDMD, and various transcription factors. This dual role of ncRNAs offers a unique therapeutic potential to manipulate pyroptosis pathways, providing opportunities for innovative cancer treatments. In this review, we integrate current research findings to propose novel strategies for leveraging ncRNA-mediated pyroptosis as a therapeutic intervention in lung cancer. We explore the potential of ncRNAs as biomarkers for predicting patient response to treatment and as targets for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies.",
