  "title": "Estimated mortality rates of individuals with sickle cell disease in Brazil: real-world evidence.",
  "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of hereditary chronic diseases with a substantial impact on quality of life and morbimortality. In Brazil, it is 1 of the most common hereditary diseases; however, there are sparse epidemiological data for the country. Using data from death certificates, we aimed to estimate the median age at death, years of life lost because of SCD, and the median survival. From 2015 to 2019, we identified 3320 records of deaths of individuals with SCD, from a total of 6 553 132 death records. Among individuals with SCD, the median age at death was 37 years less than that of the general population (SCD: aged 32.0 years at death, interquartile range [IQR], 19.0-46.0; general population: aged 69.0 years at death; IQR, 53.0-81.0). Results were consistent when stratified by sex or race. Over the 5 years evaluated, crude death rates varied from 0.30 to 0.34 per 100 000 inhabitants (mean 0.32 per 100 000 inhabitants). We estimated a prevalence of 60 017 individuals living with SCD (29.02 cases per 100 000) and an average incidence of 1362 cases yearly. The median estimated survival was 40 years for individuals with SCD and 80 years for the general population. SCD was associated with an increased risk of mortality in most age ranges. Among individuals with SCD aged between 1 and 9 years and between 10 and 39 years, the risk of death was 32 and 13 times higher, respectively. The most common causes of death were sepsis and respiratory failure. These results highlight the burden of SCD in Brazil and the necessity of improved care for this population.",
