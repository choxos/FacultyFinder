  "abstract": "Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are a rare complication of pancreatitis, and their rupture and bleeding cause high mortality. We present the case of a 76-year-old woman with fibromuscular dysplasia who developed a new left hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm within a week of her first episode of acute pancreatitis and later suffered an acute pseudoaneurysm bleed successfully treated with transcatheter coil embolization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case reported of a patient with fibromuscular dysplasia with pancreatitis-related pseudoaneurysm formation. One must consider pseudoaneurysms and associated bleeding as complications of acute pancreatitis because prompt recognition can lead to timely management.",
