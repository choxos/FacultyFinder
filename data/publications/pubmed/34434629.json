  "title": "Jobs and Research-Related Outcomes from the NIST-ARRA Construction Grants.",
  "abstract": "In 2009 and 2010, NIST's Construction Grant Program (NCGP) issued grants to 15 universities and 1 nonprofit institution to construct new or expand existing research facilities. Using $180 million provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and an additional $221 million provided by awardees, these grants led to the construction of 87,991 square meters (947,000 square feet) of academic research and development (R&D) space. This amounted to approximately 10 % of all R&D space constructed by U.S. academic institutions during the same period. This paper summarizes these 16 construction grants and highlights the number of additional research grants, patents, publications, and other benefits that resulted from the use of these facilities, six years after ARRA was signed into law.",
