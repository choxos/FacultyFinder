  "title": "Applying normative atlases in deep brain stimulation: a comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged as a crucial therapeutic strategy for various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Precise target localization is essential for optimizing therapeutic outcomes, necessitating advanced neuroimaging techniques. Normative atlases provide standardized references for accurate electrode placement, enhancing treatment customization and efficacy. This comprehensive review explores the application of normative atlases in DBS, emphasizing their role in target identification, patient-specific electrode placement, and predicting stimulation outcomes. Challenges, such as variability across atlases and technical complexities, are addressed alongside future directions and innovations, including advancements in neuroimaging technologies and the integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Normative atlases play a pivotal role in enhancing DBS precision and patient outcomes, promising a future of personalized and effective therapies in neurology and psychiatry.",
