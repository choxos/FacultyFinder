  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a comprehensive Appropriateness of Prescribing Evaluation Questionnaire (APEQ) suitable for human and computer use. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was part of an ongoing research program examining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of computerized prescribing decision support for providers, patients, and drug policy. A nominal group consensus process involved physicians, both primary care physicians and specialists, pharmacists, drug plan managers, patients, patient advocates, and pharmaceutical industry. Structured case scenarios of musculoskeletal problems were used to evaluate APEQ's validity and responsiveness. RESULTS: Seventeen panelists evaluated 72 patient scenarios in two rounds. Their ratings of appropriateness, assessed by ANOVA, showed significant agreement with the experts' scores in the two rounds, which evaluated appropriateness and responsiveness, respectively. Interrater and intrarater agreement was moderate to good. CONCLUSION: This formal assessment suggests that APEQ has reasonable validity, reliability, and responsiveness. Such tools could be very useful in e-prescribing and e-claims reimbursement environments and should be further explored.",
