  "abstract": "CuH-catalyzed diasterospecific synthesis of 3-hydroxyindolines and 2-aryl-3H-indol-3-ones have been developed from o-alkynylnitroarenes in the presence of hydrosilane as the reductant. The protocol employs nitro as both nitrogen and oxygen sources for the intramolecular simultaneous construction of C-N and C-O bonds.",
