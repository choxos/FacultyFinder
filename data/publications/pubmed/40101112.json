  "title": "Weight-Adjusted Waist Index May Predict Hypertension Plus Hyperuricemia.",
  "abstract": "The weight-adjusted waist index (WWI) is a novel indicator that could estimate body fat and muscle mass. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between WWI and hypertension plus hyperuricemia (HTN-HUA). The data were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database from 1999 to 2018. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore the association between WWI with HTN-HUA, hypertension (HTN) alone, and hyperuricemia (HUA) alone. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were employed to examine potential nonlinear associations. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to assess the predictive ability of WWI. A total of 16 294 participants were included, among whom 2280 (12%) were diagnosed with HTN-HUA, 5148 (28%) with HTN alone, and 1252 (9%) with HUA alone. WWI was significantly associated with HTN-HUA, HTN alone, and HUA alone after adjusting for potential confounders. Compared to the lowest quartiles of WWI, the odds ratios of the highest quartiles were 2.13 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.59-2.83) for HTN-HUA, 1.28 (95% CI: 1.08-1.5) for HTN alone, and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.18-2.16) for HUA alone. RCS analyses demonstrated a nonlinear association between WWI and HTN-HUA. The fully adjusted model, which included WWI, exhibited a moderate predictive ability for HTN-HUA (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.804, 95% CI 0.796-0.813). The association between WWI and HTN-HUA was more prominent among young individuals and those with normal weight. The study suggested that a significant and nonlinear association between WWI and HTN-HUA. WWI had the potential to facilitate the early detection of HTN-HUA.",
