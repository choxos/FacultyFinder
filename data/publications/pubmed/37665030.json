  "title": "Barriers and Facilitators of a Community-Based, Slow-Stream Rehabilitation, Hospital-to-Home Transition Program for Older Adults: Perspectives of a Multidisciplinary Care Team.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the perspectives of support staff, health care professionals, and care coordinators working in or referring to a community-based, slow-stream rehabilitation, hospital-to-home transition program regarding gaps in services, and barriers and facilitators related to implementation and functioning of the program. This was a qualitative descriptive study. Recruitment was conducted through purposive sampling, and 23 individuals participated in a focus groups or individual semi-structured interview. Transcripts were analyzed by six researchers using inductive thematic analysis. Themes that emerged were organized based on a socio-ecological framework. Themes were categorized as: (1) macro level, meaning gaps while waiting for program, limited program capacity, and gaps in service post-program completion; (2) meso level, meaning lack of knowledge and awareness of the program, lack of specific referral process and procedures, lack of specific eligibility criteria, and need for enhanced communication among care settings; or (3) micro level, meaning services provided, program participant benefits, person-centred communication, program structure constraints, need for use of outcome measures, and follow-up or lack of follow-up. Implementation of seamless patient information sharing, documentation, use of specific referral criteria, and use of standardized outcome measures may reduce the number of unsuitable referrals and provide useful information for referral and program staff.",
