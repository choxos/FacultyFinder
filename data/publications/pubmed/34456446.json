  "abstract": "Purpose: Interactive exercise technology (IET) is an effective and practical way to support physiotherapy for older adults. The purpose of this study was to use design thinking to collect feedback on the first iteration of an IET prototype from older adults and health professionals and to use that feedback to gain an understanding of their needs and values, with the goal of developing recommendations to inform the second iteration of the IET prototype. Method: This study was conducted using three steps of design thinking: (1) test, in which four focus groups were conducted, asking older adults and health professionals about their perspectives on an IET prototype; (2) empathize, in which the focus group discussions were recorded and transcribed and thematic content analysis was conducted; and (3) define, in which the needs and values of the participants were identified. Results: The participants were 19 health professionals and four older adults. Four themes, which represented the values that these groups held regarding IET design, were revealed: instruction, safety, accessibility, and motivation. Conclusions: Older adults and health professionals have specific needs for the design of IET, which should be considered in the development of future IET.",
