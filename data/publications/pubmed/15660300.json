  "title": "Barriers and facilitators in pain management in long-term care institutions: a qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify barriers to the management of pain in long-term care institutions. Formal caregivers practising in four long-term care institutions in Hamilton, Ontario participated in eight focus groups. Participants included 6 physicians, 19 registered nurses, 8 registered practical nurses, 13 health care aides and 8 occupational therapists or physiotherapists. Three types of barriers were found: caregiver-related, patient-related and systems-related. Four themes for facilitating pain management were identified: (a) caregivers knowing the patient, (b) family support, (c) caregivers demonstrating understanding and compassion, and (d) teamwork by caregivers. Formal caregivers practising in long-term care institutions encounter a multitude of barriers that hinder the adequate assessment and treatment of pain, such as caregiver beliefs and knowledge and cognitive impairment in patients. Innovative strategies and strong political will are needed to overcome them.",
