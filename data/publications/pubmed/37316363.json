  "title": "The current role of Tofacitinib in acute severe ulcerative colitis in adult patients: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite rescue therapy, acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) is associated with a high risk of colectomy, while treatment options remain limited. Tofacitinib, a rapidly acting Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor, is gaining ground as an effective alternative treatment option for the management of acute severe ulcerative colitis, which may prevent emergency colectomy. METHODS: A systematic literature search of PubMed and Embase was undertaken for studies of adult patients with ASUC treated with tofacitinib. RESULTS: In total, two observational studies, seven case series and five case reports incorporating 134 patients who received tofacitinib in ASUC were identified with a follow-up period ranging from 30 days to 14 months. Overall, the pooled colectomy rate was 23.9% (95% CI 16.6-31.2). The pooled 90-day and 6-month colectomy free rate were 79.9% (95% CI 73.1-86.7) and 71.6% (95% CI 64-79.2) respectively. The most frequent adverse event was C. Difficile infection. CONCLUSIONS: Tofacitinib appears to be a promising option for the treatment of ASUC. Randomized clinical trials are required to further access the efficacy, safety and optimal dose of tofacitinib in cases of ASUC.",
