  "title": "An Evaluation of Cardiology Virtual Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
  "abstract": "A survey evaluation was conducted in the division of cardiology at a tertiary care academic centre to assess barriers, facilitators, acceptability, and feasibility of virtual care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey responses from 26 health care providers, 45 patients, and 2 caregivers showed that virtual visits (primarily by telephone) were feasible and generally acceptable to most respondents. Key opportunities for improvement included availability of easy-to-use video platforms, space and equipment in clinics, provision of information to patients before visits, and appropriate selection of patients for virtual visits. Results will inform optimization of virtual care during this pandemic and beyond.",
