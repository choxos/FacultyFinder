  "title": "Statistical genetics with application to population-based study design: a primer for clinicians.",
  "abstract": "With the completion of the entire human genome sequence and remarkable advances in genotyping technologies, there has been an increased interest in the application of genetics and genomics in biomedical research over the last decade. Large-scale population-based genetic association studies have now become routine and their application to several multifactorial diseases such as cardiovascular disorders has led to the identification of a number of novel susceptibility genes. However, to be able to interpret results from such studies, clinicians need to have a basic understanding of unique concepts and issues related to this fast-moving area of research. In this primer, we provide a broad overview of design, analysis, and methodological issues with a focus on population-based study design.",
