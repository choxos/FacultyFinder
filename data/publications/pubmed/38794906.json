  "title": "Quantitative MRI Analysis of Patellofemoral Joint Cartilage Health 2 Years After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction and Lateral Extra-Articular Tenodesis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The addition of an iliotibial band-based lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) to anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction (ACLR) has been shown to reduce failure rates. However, there are concerns as to the potential overconstraint of tibiofemoral kinematics that may increase the risk of cartilage degradation. To date, no clinical study has investigated the effect of LET on patellofemoral joint articular cartilage health. HYPOTHESIS: It was hypothesized that at 2 years postoperatively, (1) the addition of LET at the time of ACLR would have no effect on cartilage health on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and (2) higher cartilage relaxation values would be associated with worse patient-reported and functional outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. METHODS: A subset of patients from the STABILITY 1 randomized controlled trial were included. All patients underwent primary ACLR with a hamstring autograft. Patients were randomized to either LET augmentation or not. Cartilage status in the patellofemoral joint between the ACLR group and ACLR+LET group was compared using 2-year postoperative quantitative MRI and the ACL osteoarthritis scores of both the surgical and the contralateral nonsurgical knees. Objective functional outcomes and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were attained. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients (43 patients in the ACLR group; mean age, 18.9 ± 3.2 years; 60.5% female; and 49 patients in the ACLR+LET group; mean age, 18.7 ± 3.2 years, 63.3% female) were included. No significant differences were seen in the mean values (ms) for adjusted T1ρ/T2 relaxation times in the medial patella (47.8/42.2 vs 47.3/43.2), central patella (45.5/42.5 vs 44.1/42.7), lateral patella (48.2/43.5 vs 47.3/43.0), medial trochlea (54.7/50.9 vs 56.4/50.9), central trochlea (53.3/51.1 vs 53.1/52.0), and lateral trochlea (54.9/52.1 vs 53.9/52.6) between the ACLR and ACLR+LET groups. No difference in overall ACL osteoarthritis scores was observed (P = .99). An increase in medial patellar T2 relaxation times was associated with a decreasing International Knee Documentation Committee score (P = .046), Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) Symptoms subscale score (P = .01), and total KOOS (P = .01). CONCLUSION: There was no statistical difference in patellofemoral cartilage health between knees 2 years after primary ACLR with hamstring tendon autograft with or without LET. Statistically significant correlations were found between quantitative MRI relaxation times, functional outcome scores, and PROMs; however, the correlations were weak and the clinical significance is unknown.
