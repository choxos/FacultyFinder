  "abstract": "Accidental falls of patients cannot be completely prevented. However, timely fall detection can help prevent further complications such as blood loss and unconsciousness. In this study, the authors present a cost-effective integrated system designed to remotely detect patient falls in hospitals in addition to classifying non-fall motions into activities of daily living. The proposed system is a wearable device that consists of a camera, gyroscope, and accelerometer that is interfaced with a credit card-sized single board microcomputer. The information received from the camera is used in a visual-based classifier and the sensor data is analysed using the k-Nearest Neighbour and Na√Øve Bayes' classifiers. Once a fall is detected, an attendant at the hospital is informed. Experimental results showed that the accuracy of the device in classifying fall versus non-fall activity is 95%. Other requirements and specifications are discussed in greater detail.",
