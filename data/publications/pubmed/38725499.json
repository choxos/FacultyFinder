  "title": "The circularly permuted globin domain of androglobin exhibits atypical heme stabilization and nitric oxide interaction.",
  "abstract": "In the decade since the discovery of androglobin, a multi-domain hemoglobin of metazoans associated with ciliogenesis and spermatogenesis, there has been little advance in the knowledge of the biochemical and structural properties of this unusual member of the hemoglobin superfamily. Using a method for aligning remote homologues, coupled with molecular modelling and molecular dynamics, we have identified a novel structural alignment to other hemoglobins. This has led to the first stable recombinant expression and characterization of the circularly permuted globin domain. Exceptional for eukaryotic globins is that a tyrosine takes the place of the highly conserved phenylalanine in the CD1 position, a critical point in stabilizing the heme. A disulfide bond, similar to that found in neuroglobin, forms a closed loop around the heme pocket, taking the place of androglobin's missing CD loop and further supporting the heme pocket structure. Highly unusual in the globin superfamily is that the heme iron binds nitric oxide as a five-coordinate complex similar to other heme proteins that have nitric oxide storage functions. With rapid autoxidation and high nitrite reductase activity, the globin appears to be more tailored toward nitric oxide homeostasis or buffering. The use of our multi-template profile alignment method to yield the first biochemical characterisation of the circularly permuted globin domain of androglobin expands our knowledge of the fundamental functioning of this elusive protein and provides a pathway to better define the link between the biochemical traits of androglobin with proposed physiological functions.",
