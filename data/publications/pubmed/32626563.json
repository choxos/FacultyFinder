  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is one of the most common bacterial infections worldwide, which is associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. In this study, we compared the efficacy of 10-day versus 12-day concomitant therapy as the first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication in Iran. METHODS 218 patients with peptic ulcer disease and na√Øve H. pylori infection, were randomly divided into two groups to receive either 10-day or 12-day concomitant regimens, composed of pantoprazole 40 mg, amoxicillin 1000 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and metronidazole 500 mg, all given twice daily. Eight weeks after treatment, H. pylori eradication was assessed by 14C- urea breath test. The trial was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (code: IRCT20170521034070N2). RESULTS 212 patients completed the study. According to the intention to treat analysis, the eradication rates were 83.6% (95% CI: 76.6-90.5) and 88.8% (95% CI: 82.8-94.7) in 10-day and 12-day concomitant therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.24). Per-protocol eradication rates were 85.9% (95% CI: 79.3-92.4) and 92.6% (95% CI: 87.6-97.5), respectively (p = 0.19). The rates of severe side effects were not statistically different between the two groups (3.6% vs. 8.1%; p = 0.428). CONCLUSION 12-day concomitant therapy could achieve ideal eradication rates by both intention to treat and perprotocol analyses. In order to reduce the cost of drugs and the rate of adverse effects of therapy, among 10-day and 12day regimens, 12-day concomitant therapy seems to be a good alternative to 14-day concomitant therapy that has been suggested by international guidelines.",
