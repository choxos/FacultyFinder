  "title": "Clinician-reported outcome measures for the assessment of vitiligo: A scoping review.",
  "abstract": "Clinician-reported outcome measures (ClinROMs) are essential for assessment of vitiligo in clinical trials and daily practice. Several instruments have been developed and tested to measure, for example, vitiligo extent, repigmentation and activity. The goal of this review was to identify all introductory publications of ClinROMs for vitiligo that include at least some aspects of validation and to describe the instruments' characteristics, intention for use and practical strengths and limitations. A search strategy was conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) from inception to July 2022. Based on the literature search (n = 2860), 10 articles were identified, describing 14 different ClinROMs. Six ClinRoms measured disease extent and/or repigmentation, seven evaluated disease activity and one was a composite score. The Vitiligo Area Scoring Index (VASI), and Vitiligo Extent Score (VES and VESplus) measure overall disease extent and/or repigmentation. The VASI relies on hand units (1% body surface area), whereas the VES and VESplus use a picture-based scoring technique. The Vitiligo Extent Score for a Target Area (VESTA) measures repigmentation percentage for target lesions. One global assessment score for extent has been validated. Vitiligo disease activity scores included a static measure of clinical activity signs (Vitiligo Signs of Activity Score [VSAS]) and two measures assessing dynamic evolution (Vitiligo Disease Activity Score [VDAS] and Vitiligo Disease Improvement Score [VDIS]). The Vitiligo European Task Force assessment tool (VETFa) is a composite score. Depending on the practical strengths and limitations as well as the research question and setting (clinical trials vs. daily practice), the choice of an appropriate ClinROM may differ. Fourteen ClinROMs in vitiligo were identified to measure vitiligo extent, repigmentation, and activity. Further research evaluating the validity, reliability, and responsiveness of each instrument and worldwide consensus on which instrument to use for a specific outcome (domain) is greatly needed.",
