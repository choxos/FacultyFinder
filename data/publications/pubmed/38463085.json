  "title": "Role of gut microbiota in cardiovascular diseases - a comprehensive review.",
  "abstract": "The connection between cardiovascular illnesses and the gut microbiota has drawn more and more attention in recent years. According to research, there are intricate relationships between dietary elements, gut bacteria, and their metabolites that affect cardiovascular health. In this study, the role of gut microbiota in cardiovascular disorders is examined, with an emphasis on the cardiac consequences brought on by changes in gut microbiota. This essay discusses the gut-heart axis in depth and in detail. It talks about clinical research looking at how soy consumption, probiotic supplements, and dietary changes affected gut microbiota and cardiovascular risk variables. Our goal is to clarify the possible pathways that connect gut microbiota to cardiovascular health and the implications for upcoming treatment approaches. The authors examine the composition, roles, and effects of the gut microbiota on cardiovascular health, including their contributions to hypertension, atherosclerosis, lipid metabolism, and heart failure. Endotoxemia, inflammation, immunological dysfunction, and host lipid metabolism are some of the potential processes investigated for how the gut microbiota affects cardiac outcomes. The research emphasizes the need for larger interventional studies and personalized medicine strategies to completely understand the complexity of the gut-heart axis and its implications for the management of cardiovascular disease. The development of novel treatment strategies and cutting-edge diagnostic technologies in cardiovascular medicine may be facilitated by a better understanding of this axis.",
