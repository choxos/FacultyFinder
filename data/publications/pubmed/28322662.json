  "title": "Engaging Adults With Chronic Disease in Online Depressive Symptom Self-Management.",
  "abstract": "The main purpose of this study was to evaluate participant engagement and effects of an Internet-based, self-directed program for depressive symptoms piloted among adults with a chronic disease. Eligible participants (N = 47) were randomly assigned to either the \"Think Clearly About Depression\" online depression self-management program or the control group. The Patient Health Questionnaire-8 and Chronic Disease Self-Efficacy Scales were administered at baseline and at Weeks 4 and 8 after initiating the intervention. Number Needed to Treat analysis indicated that one in every three treatment group participants found clinically significant reductions in depressive symptoms by Week 8. Paired-sample t tests showed that depressive symptoms and self-efficacy in management of depressive symptoms improved over time for those in the treatment group and not for those in the control group. Participants' engagement and satisfaction with the online program were favorable.",
