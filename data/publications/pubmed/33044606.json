  "title": "Arthroscopic management of greater trochanter pain syndrome and abductor tears has demonstrated promising results in terms of improvement in pain scores and functional outcomes: a scoping review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) refers to the constellation of signs and symptoms related to pain in the trochanteric region and has recently replaced the previously ubiquitous term of 'greater trochanteric bursitis'. GTPS is common, particularly in women 50-79 years of age, and the understanding and management of GTPS have expanded considerably in recent years to include management with arthroscopic and endoscopic techniques in recalcitrant cases. The purpose of this scoping literature review was to summarize the current evidence on arthroscopic management of GTPS including sources of evidence, key concepts, and gaps in the literature. METHODS: A thorough electronic database search included studies published from 2009 to June 14, 2020. A total of 52 peer-reviewed articles were identified within the literature on arthroscopic or endoscopic management of GTPS. RESULTS: Of the 52 identified papers, 12 were technique descriptions, 10 papers were review articles, and 30 papers were original clinical papers. Of the 30 clinical papers, 24 (80%) were of level IV evidence, 5 (17%) were of level III evidence, and 1 (3%) was level II evidence. Among the 30 clinical studies, 988 patients were included with 761 (77%) female. Indications for surgical management included a failed trial of conservative management in all 30 studies, typically after a period of 3-6Â months. Surgical management consisted of arthroscopic/endoscopic abductor tendon repair in 16 (53%) studies, arthroscopic/endoscopic bursectomy and iliotibial band release in 12 (40%) studies, and arthroscopic/endoscopic gluteal tendon contracture release in 2 (7%) studies. CONCLUSION: Overall, results following arthroscopic management of GTPS and abductor tears have been promising, including significantly improved pain scores and functional outcomes at final post-operative assessment. These studies support continued use and investigation of arthroscopic management strategies of GTPS and pave the way to conduct larger prospective studies to confirm these results in the future. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV.",
