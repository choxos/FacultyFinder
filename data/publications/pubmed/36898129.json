  "title": "Prevalence of sarcopenia indicators and sub-optimal protein intake among elective total joint replacement patients.",
  "abstract": "Sarcopenia is associated with falls, and can complicate recovery following total joint replacement (TJR) surgery. We examined (1) the prevalence of sarcopenia indicators and lower-than-recommended protein intake among TJR patients and non-TJR community participants and (2) the relationships between dietary protein intake and sarcopenia indicators. We recruited adults â‰¥65 years of age who were undergoing TJR, and adults from the community not undergoing TJR (controls). We assessed grip strength and appendicular lean soft-tissue mass (ALSTMBMI) using DXA, and applied the original Foundation for the National Institutes of Health Sarcopenia Project cut-points for sarcopenia indicators (grip strength <26 kg for men and <16 kg for women; ALSTM <0.789 m[2] for men and <0.512 m[2] for women) and less conservative cut-points (grip strength <31.83 kg for men and <19.99 kg for women; ALSTM <0.725 m[2] for men and <0.591 m[2] for women). Total daily and per meal protein intakes were derived from 5-day diet records. Sixty-seven participants (30 TJR, 37 controls) were enrolled. Using less conservative cut-points for sarcopenia, more control participants were weak compared with TJR participants (46% versus 23%, p = 0.055), and more TJR participants had low ALSTMBMI (40% versus 13%, p = 0.013). Approximately 70% of controls and 76% of TJR participants consumed <1.2 g protein/kg/day (p = 0.559). Total daily dietary protein intake was positively associated with grip strength (r = 0.44, p = 0.001) and ALSTMBMI (r = 0.29, p = 0.03). Using less conservative cut-points, low ALSTMBMI, but not weakness, was more common in TJR patients. Both groups may benefit from a dietary intervention to increase protein intake, which may improve surgical outcomes in TJR patients.",
