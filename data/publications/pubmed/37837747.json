  "title": "Zero time waste in pre-trained early exit neural networks.",
  "abstract": "The problem of reducing processing time of large deep learning models is a fundamental challenge in many real-world applications. Early exit methods strive towards this goal by attaching additional Internal Classifiers (ICs) to intermediate layers of a neural network. ICs can quickly return predictions for easy examples and, as a result, reduce the average inference time of the whole model. However, if a particular IC does not decide to return an answer early, its predictions are discarded, with its computations effectively being wasted. To solve this issue, we introduce Zero Time Waste (ZTW), a novel approach in which each IC reuses predictions returned by its predecessors by (1) adding direct connections between ICs and (2) combining previous outputs in an ensemble-like manner. We conduct extensive experiments across various multiple modes, datasets, and architectures to demonstrate that ZTW achieves a significantly better accuracy vs. inference time trade-off than other early exit methods. On the ImageNet dataset, it obtains superior results over the best baseline method in 11 out of 16 cases, reaching up to 5 percentage points of improvement on low computational budgets.",
