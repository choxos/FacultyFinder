  "abstract": "Hell's Gate globin-I (HGb-I) is a thermally stable globin from the aerobic methanotroph Methylacidiphilium infernorum. Here we report that HGb-I interacts with lipids stoichiometrically to induce structural changes in the heme pocket, changing the heme iron distal ligation coordination from hexacoordinate to pentacoordinate. Such changes in heme geometry have only been previously reported for cytochrome c and cytoglobin, linked to apoptosis regulation and enhanced lipid peroxidation activity, respectively. However, unlike cytoglobin and cytochrome c, the heme iron of HGb-I is altered by lipids in ferrous as well as ferric oxidation states. The apparent affinity for lipids in this thermally stable globin is highly pH-dependent but essentially temperature-independent within the range of 20-60 Â°C. We propose a mechanism to explain these observations, in which lipid binding and stability of the distal endogenous ligand are juxtaposed as a function of temperature. Additionally, we propose that these coupled equilibria may constitute a mechanism through which this acidophilic thermophile senses the pH of its environment.",
