  "title": "Icariin as a therapeutic agent in breast cancer: modulating apoptosis and suppressing proliferation.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Icariin, a prenylated flavonol glycoside derived from Epimedium species, has emerged as a promising multi-targeted agent with potent anticancer activity. Preclinical studies demonstrate that icariin modulates key oncogenic pathways, including PI3K/Akt, MAPK, NF-ÎºB/SIRT6, and AMPK/mTOR to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, induce apoptosis, and regulate autophagy. Moreover, icariin exhibits anti-metastatic effects by suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and immunomodulatory actions that may enhance antitumor immunity. Despite these encouraging findings, a comprehensive understanding of its molecular mechanisms and translational potential remains limited. Here, we systematically review the latest in vitro and in vivo evidence on icariin's pharmacological effects in breast cancer models. We highlight advances in nanoformulation approaches to improve their bioavailability and identify critical knowledge gaps. This review aims to guide future research toward optimized delivery systems and well-designed clinical trials by integrating mechanistic insights with formulation science. Ultimately, elucidating the full therapeutic profile of icariin will inform its incorporation into complementary and integrative oncology regimens, potentially improving outcomes for patients with diverse breast cancer subtypes.",
