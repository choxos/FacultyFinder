  "title": "Design of in-situ implant for the brain-targeted drug delivery using cross-linked gellan gum polymer through response surface methodology.",
  "abstract": "The analysis aimed to prepare an in-situ implant (ISFI) formulation holding dimethyl fumarate as (a model drug) using cross-linked gellan gum by homogenization method. Cross-linking of gellan gum was done with L-cysteine to improve its gelation properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry were used to test the compatibility of the drug-polymer. The diverse formulations were prepared and tested using Design ExpertÂ® ver 8.0.1 software to optimize the experiment technique and employ the response surface. The tissue compatibility of the test verified the existence of non-irritants in the established formulation. All preparations contained the drug content from approximately 97.98 to 99.88%. Viscosities are ideal for injection in the optimized formulation (1,55 percent w/w in water). The optimized formula was monitored, and up to 156hours, it was found to be 95.7%. The result was that ISFI can effectively monitor and control the delivery of several powerful drug products.",
