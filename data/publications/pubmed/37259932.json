  "abstract": "Canopy FGF signaling regulator 2 (CNPY2) is a novel angiogenic growth factor. In recent years, increasing evidence highlights that CNPY2 has important functions in health and disease. Many new blood vessels need to be formed to meet the nutrient supply in the process of tumor growth. CNPY2 can participate in the development of tumors by promoting angiogenesis. CNPY2 also enhances neurite outgrowth in neurologic diseases and promotes cell proliferation and tissue repair, thereby improving cardiac function in cardiovascular diseases. Regrettably, there are few studies on CNPY2 in various diseases. At the same time, its biological function and molecular mechanism in the process and development of disease are still unclear. This paper reviews the recent studies on CNPY2 in cervical cancer, renal cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury, spinal cord ischemia-reperfusion injury, Parkinson's disease, ischemic heart disease, myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The biological function and molecular mechanism of CNPY2 in these diseases have been summarized in this paper. Many drugs that play protective roles in tumors, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and neurologic diseases by targeting CNPY2, have also been summarized in this paper. In addition, the paper also details the biological functions and roles of canopy FGF signaling regulator 1 (CNPY1), canopy FGF signaling regulator 3 (CNPY3), canopy FGF signaling regulator 4 (CNPY4), and canopy FGF signaling regulator 5 (CNPY5). The mechanism and function of CNPY2 should be continued to study in order to accelerate disease prevention in the future.",
