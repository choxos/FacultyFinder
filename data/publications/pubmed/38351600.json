  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach is used to assess the certainty of evidence in systematic reviews and meta-analyses. METHODS: We describe how the GRADE approach is used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including key points and examples. This overview is aimed at clinicians and researchers who are, or plan to be, involved in the development or assessment of systematic reviews with meta-analyses using GRADE. RESULTS: We outline how the certainty of evidence is assessed, how the evidence is summarized using GRADE evidence profiles or summary of findings tables, how the results are communicated, and we discuss challenges, advantages, and disadvantages with using GRADE. CONCLUSIONS: This overview aims to provide an overview of how GRADE is used in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, and may be used by systematic review developers, methodologists, and evidence end-users.",
