  "title": "Expression of secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor and elafin in human fallopian tube and in an in-vitro model of Chlamydia trachomatis infection.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI) and elafin are anti-protease and anti-microbial molecules with a role in innate immune defence. They have been demonstrated at multiple mucosal surfaces including those of the female reproductive tract. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study details their expression in human Fallopian tubes (ampullary region) throughout the menstrual cycle (n = 18) and from women with ectopic pregnancy (n = 6), and examined their regulation by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in an in-vitro model. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that SLPI and elafin were constitutively expressed in the Fallopian tube during the menstrual cycle but were increased in ectopic pregnancy (P < 0.05 versus early-mid luteal phase, P < 0.01 versus all phases, respectively). SLPI and elafin were immunolocalised to the Fallopian tube epithelium in biopsies from non-pregnant women and those with ectopic pregnancy. An in-vitro culture model of C. trachomatis infection of the OE-E6/E7 oviductal epithelial cell line showed that elafin mRNA expression was upregulated in response to chlamydial infection. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that SLPI and elafin have a role in the innate immune defence of the Fallopian tube in infection and ectopic pregnancy. Their role is likely to include regulation of protease activity, wound healing and tissue remodelling.",
