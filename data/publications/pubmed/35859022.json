  "title": "Patient-Level Factors Associated with Health-Related Quality of Life and Satisfaction with Body After Bariatric Surgery: a Multicenter, Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is a key outcome of success after bariatric surgery. Not all patients report improved HRQL scores postoperatively, which may be due to patient-level factors. It is unknown which factors influence HRQL after surgery. Our objective was to assess patient-level factors associated with HRQL after surgery. METHODS: This international cross-sectional study included 730 patients who had bariatric surgery. Participants completed BODY-Q scales pertaining to HRQL and satisfaction with body, and demographic characteristics were obtained. The sample was divided into three groups based on time since surgery: 0 - 1 year, 1 - 3 years and more than 3 years. Uni- and multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to identify variables associated with the BODY-Q scales per group. RESULTS: The 0 - 1 year postoperative group included 377 patients (50.9%), the 1 - 3 years postoperative group 218 (29.4%) and the more than 3 years postoperative group 135 patients (18.2%). Lower current body-mass index (BMI), more weight loss (%TWL), being employed, having no comorbidities, higher age and shorter time since surgery were significantly associated with improved HRQL outcomes postoperatively. None of these factors influenced all BODY-Q scales. The effect of current BMI increased with longer time since surgery. CONCLUSION: Factors including current BMI, %TWL, employment status, presence of comorbidities, age and time since surgery were associated with HRQL postoperatively. This information may be used to optimize patient-tailored care, improve patient education and underline the importance of long-term follow-up with special attention to weight regain to ensure lasting improvement in HRQL.",
