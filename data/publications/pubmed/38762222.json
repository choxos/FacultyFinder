  "title": "Coproduced, arts interventions for nurturing care (0-5 years) in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs): a realist review.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Community-based arts interventions have the potential to support contextually relevant nurturing care programmes and policies that adapt to different settings. Understanding the distinctive features of using the arts in local, culturally specific ways in low/middle-income countries (LMICs); how this varies by context; and gaining a better understanding of the perspectives on desirable outcomes for communities is important evidence that this review generates. DESIGN: We conducted a realist review of papers that covered outcomes related to child health or development (0-5 years) AND arts-based approaches AND community-based, participatory approaches AND based in LMICs using a range of databases and other networks. A coding framework was developed covering context, intervention, outcomes, mechanisms, study, sustainability, transferability and scalability. RESULTS: The included papers reported 18 unique interventions. Interventions covered 14 countries, with evidence lacking for South America, Arab countries and parts of Africa. Lead authors came from mostly clinical science-based disciplines and from institutions in a different country to the country/countries studied. Intended outcomes from interventions included clinical, health systems/organisation, changes in practices/behaviours/knowledge/attitudes, and wider social and educational goals. We identified three demi-regularities (semi-predictable patterns or pathways of programme functioning): participatory design based on valuing different sources of expertise; dynamic adaptation of intervention to context; and community participation in arts-based approaches. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that arts-based, nurturing care interventions have greater potential when they include local knowledge, embed into existing infrastructures and there is a clear plan for ongoing resourcing of the intervention. Studies with better documentation of the lessons learnt, regarding the intervention delivery process and the power dynamics involved, are needed to better understand what works, for whom and in which contexts.",
