  "title": "Automatic Radar-Based Step Length Measurement in the Home for Older Adults Living with Frailty.",
  "abstract": "With an aging population, numerous assistive and monitoring technologies are under development to enable older adults to age in place. To facilitate aging in place, predicting risk factors such as falls and hospitalization and providing early interventions are important. Much of the work on ambient monitoring for risk prediction has centered on gait speed analysis, utilizing privacy-preserving sensors like radar. Despite compelling evidence that monitoring step length in addition to gait speed is crucial for predicting risk, radar-based methods have not explored step length measurement in the home. Furthermore, laboratory experiments on step length measurement using radars are limited to proof-of-concept studies with few healthy subjects. To address this gap, a radar-based step length measurement system for the home is proposed based on detection and tracking using a radar point cloud followed by Doppler speed profiling of the torso to obtain step lengths in the home. The proposed method was evaluated in a clinical environment involving 35 frail older adults to establish its validity. Additionally, the method was assessed in people's homes, with 21 frail older adults who had participated in the clinical assessment. The proposed radar-based step length measurement method was compared to the gold-standard Zeno Walkway Gait Analysis System, revealing a 4.5 cm/8.3% error in a clinical setting. Furthermore, it exhibited excellent reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.96) in uncontrolled home settings. The method also proved accurate in uncontrolled home settings, as indicated by a strong consistency (ICC(3,k) = 0.81 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.92)) between home measurements and in-clinic assessments.",
