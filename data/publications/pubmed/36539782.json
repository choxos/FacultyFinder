  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been shown to significantly improve the survival of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). However, only limited proportion of patients could benefit from ICIs. Novel biomarkers with strong predictability are needed for clinicians to maximize the efficacy of ICIs. Our study aimed to identify potential biomarkers predicting ICIs efficacy in LUAD. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) PanCancer Atlas studies in cBioportal were used to evaluate the mutation frequency of ANK2 across multiple cancers. Clinical and mutational data for LUAD from ICIs-treated cohorts (Hellmann et al. and Rizvi et al.) were collected to explore the correlation between ANK2 mutation and clinical outcomes. In addition, the relationship between ANK2 expression and clinical outcomes was analyzed using LUAD data from TCGA and Gene Expression Omnibus. Furthermore, the impact of ANK2 mutation and expression on the tumor immune microenvironment of LUAD was analyzed using TCGA and TISIDB databases. RESULTS: Patients with ANK2 mutation benefited more from ICIs. In ICIs-treated cohort, prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) (median PFS: NR (not reached) vs. 5.42 months, HR (hazard ratio) 0.31, 95% CI 0.18-0.54; P = 0.0037), improved complete response rate (17.65% vs. 1.85%, P = 0.0402), and improved objective response rate (64.71% vs. 24.07%, P = 0.0033) were observed in LUAD patients with ANK2 mutation compared to their wild-type counterparts. Regarding ANK2 expression, it was observed that ANK2 expression was decreased in LUAD (P < 0.05) and a higher level of ANK2 expression was associated with longer overall survival (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-0.92; P = 0.012) in TCGA LUAD cohort. Moreover, ANK2 mutation or higher ANK2 expression correlated with enhanced antitumor immunity and \"hot\" tumor microenvironment in LUAD, which could be potential mechanisms that ANK2 mutation facilitated ICIs therapy and patients with higher ANK2 expression survived longer. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that ANK2 mutation or increased ANK2 expression may serve as a favorable biomarker for the efficacy of ICIs in patients with LUAD.",
