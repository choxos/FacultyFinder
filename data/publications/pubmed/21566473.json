  "abstract": "Fragility fractures, being a consequence of low bone quality and density, are key clinically relevant markers of bone frailty diseases such as osteoporosis. Numerous barriers to adequate osteoporotic care today have been reported. These include inadequate knowledge and sensitivity to this public health problem. This is compounded by lack of communication and coordination of care. Improvement in the dialogue between orthopaedic surgeons and primary care physicians is a necessary step in the identification and treatment of patients with fragility fractures. Cross-disciplinary educational modules should be produced that include patient-friendly materials.",
