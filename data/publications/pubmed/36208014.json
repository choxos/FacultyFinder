  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adverse events (AE) of treatment are prevalent and diverse in head and neck rhabdomyosarcoma (HNRMS) survivors. These AEs are often reported by physicians; however, patients' perceptions of specific AE are not well known. In this study, we explored patient-reported outcomes measuring appearance, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and facial function in HNRMS survivors. Second, we assess the relationship between physician grading of AE and patient reporting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survivors of pediatric HNRMS, diagnosed between 1993 and 2017, who were at least 2 years after completing treatment were invited to an outpatient clinic as part of a multicenter cross-sectional cohort study. At the outpatient clinics, survivors aged ≥8 years filled out the FACE-Q Craniofacial module; a patient-reported outcome instrument measuring issues specific to patients with facial differences. AE were systematically assessed by a multidisciplinary team based on the Common Terminology Criteria of Adverse Events system. RESULTS: Seventy-seven survivors with a median age of 16 years (range 8-43) and median follow-up of 10 years (range 2-42) completed the questionnaire and were screened for AEs. Patient-reported outcomes varied widely between survivors. Many survivors reported negative consequences: 82% on appearance items, 81% on HRQOL items, and 38% on facial function items. There was a weak correlation between physician-scored AEs and the majority of patient-reported outcomes specific for those AEs. CONCLUSIONS: Physician-graded AEs are not sufficient to provide tailored care for HNMRS survivors. Findings from this study highlight the importance of incorporating patient-reported outcome measures in survivorship follow-up.",
