  "title": "The Impact of Waivers on Summer Meal Participation in Maryland.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) is a federally funded program that serves free, nutritious meals during the summer months. In 2019, 6 federal waivers that previously helped sponsors serve meals were rescinded. The purpose of this mixed methods study was to assess the impact of the waiver rescission on the experiences of SFSP sponsors in Maryland. METHODS: This study analyzed responses from Maryland SFSP sponsors in a quantitative online survey and linked meal participation data for 2018 and 2019 (n = 29) and in-depth interviews (n = 11) about their experiences serving summer meals. RESULTS: Most respondents reported that the waiver rescission significantly impacted their experience serving meals, including increases in workload, spending and staffing; reductions in meal types (eg, breakfast); fewer meals served; and changing closed sites to open. Sponsors expressed desire for the state to apply for waivers on behalf of all SFSP sponsors in future years. CONCLUSION: The federal rescission of USDA summer meals waivers created substantial barriers for sponsors. To address the issues created by policy decisions, school food authorities and other SFSP should continue to work with researchers and antihunger advocates to share their experiences in order to shape state programs and policies.",
