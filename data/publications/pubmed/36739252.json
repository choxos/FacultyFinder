  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of postoperative adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (PA-TACE) plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on three centers from June 2018 to December 2020. Patients were divided into the PA-TACE (n = 48) and PA-TACE plus ICI groups (n = 42). The recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) curves were depicted by Kaplan-Meier method, and the differences between the two groups were compared using log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for RFS and OS. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) version 5.0. RESULTS: The median RFS of the PA-TACE plus ICI group was significantly longer than the PA-TACE group (12.76 months vs. 8.11 months; P = 0.038). The median OS of the PA-TACE plus ICI group was also significanfly better than the PA-TACE group (24.5 months vs. 19.1 months; P = 0.032). PA-TACE plus ICI treatment was an independent prognostic factor for RFS (HR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32-0.9, P = 0.019) and OS (HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26-0.86, P = 0.014). Only one patient experienced grade ≥3 immune-related AEs in the PA-TACE plus ICI group. CONCLUSIONS: PA-TACE plus ICI treatment had better efficacy in preventing recurrence and prolonging survival than PA-TACE alone for HCC patients with PVTT after R0 resection. This novel treatment modality may be an appropriate option for HCC with PVTT.",
