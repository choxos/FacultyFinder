  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study is the first to analyze primary data about the use of antipsychotic drugs among community dwelling people with dementia in German primary care. OBJECTIVES: To determine (1) prevalence of antipsychotic drug treatment in German primary care patients who screened positive for dementia and (2) factors associated with antipsychotic drug treatment. METHODS: DelpHi-MV (Dementia: life- and person-centered help in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania) is an ongoing general practitioner-based, randomized, controlled intervention trial. A total of 4,064 community dwelling patients (≥70 years) recruited from 108 participating practices were screened for dementia (DemTect <9). Of 692 eligible patients (17%), a total of 406 patients provided informed consent (59%). Present analyses are based on data of 243 patients who completed baseline assessment before January 2014 (preliminary data). RESULTS: Of the 243 patients who screened positive for dementia, a total of 25 patients (10%) received at least one antipsychotic drug. Atypical antipsychotic drugs (64%) were prescribed more often than typical antipsychotic drugs (36%). The results of the multivariate analysis showed that treatment by a specialist (neurologist/psychiatrist) was the only factor significantly associated with antipsychotic drug treatment (odds ratio, 12.86; p < 0.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-158.71). CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the antipsychotic drug treatment rate among people with dementia living in nursing homes (>50%), the rate we found for community dwelling primary care patients who screened positive for dementia was low. Further research is needed to evaluate if these patients are adequately treated or if the antipsychotic drug treatment should and could be further reduced.",
