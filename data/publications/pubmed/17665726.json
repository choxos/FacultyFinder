  "title": "Abstinence-only programs as a violation of adolescents' reproductive rights.",
  "abstract": "For most young women and young men throughout the world, adolescence is a time for the discovery and expression of sexuality. The process of this essential human behavior often occurs without accurate information about normal development, physiological processes, and the potential physical, social, and psychological results of sexual exploration. Much of the insufficient information available to adolescents in the United States and elsewhere is not accidental, but can be directly attributed to U.S. government policies, some of which infringe upon the human and reproductive rights of adolescents. Established U.S. policy that promotes abstinence-only programming through selective funding is a violation of adolescent reproductive rights, both at home and abroad. The authors explore why receiving accurate and appropriate sex education is a basic human right for adolescents, and provide suggestions about effective ways to address violations of this right.",
