  "title": "Canadians confront health care reform.",
  "abstract": "In 2002 Canadians were less anxious about the state of their health care system than they were a few years earlier, when perceptions peaked that the system needed major reform. They expressed strong support in 2002 for maintaining the status quo on health care financing (that is, no user fees and no two-tier care) within the traditional domains of physician and hospital care. But they appeared more receptive to two-tier care and for-profit delivery for the newer and rapidly expanding domains of home care and high-tech care.",
