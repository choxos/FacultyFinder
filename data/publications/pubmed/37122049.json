  "title": "Variation in the Management of Hospitalized Children With Orbital Cellulitis Over 10 Years.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: No previous study has examined the management of hospitalized children with orbital cellulitis at both children's and community hospitals across multiple sites in Canada. We describe variation and trends over time in diagnostic testing and imaging, adjunctive agents, empiric antibiotics, and surgical intervention in children hospitalized with orbital cellulitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Multicenter cohort study of 1579 children aged 2 months to 18 years with orbital cellulitis infections admitted to 10 hospitals from 2009 to 2018. We assessed hospital-level variation in the use of diagnostic tests, imaging, antibiotics, adjunctive agents, surgical intervention, and clinical outcomes using X2, Mann-Whitney U, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. The association between clinical management and length of stay was evaluated with median regression analysis with hospital as a fixed effect. RESULTS: There were significant differences between children's hospitals in usage of C-reactive protein tests (P < .001), computed tomography scans (P = .004), MRI scans (P = .003), intranasal decongestants (P < .001), intranasal corticosteroids (P < .001), intranasal saline spray (P < .001), and systemic corticosteroids (P < .001). Children's hospital patients had significantly longer length of hospital stay compared with community hospitals (P = .001). After adjustment, diagnostic testing, imaging, and subspecialty consults were associated with longer median length of hospital stay at children's hospitals. From 2009 to 2018, C-reactive protein test usage increased from 28.8% to 73.5% (P < .001), whereas erythrocyte sedimentation rate decreased from 31.5% to 14.1% (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: There was significant variation in diagnostic test usage and treatments, and increases in test usage and medical intervention rates over time despite minimal changes in surgical interventions and length of stay.",
