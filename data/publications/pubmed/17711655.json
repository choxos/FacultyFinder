  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA, with or without stents) for the treatment of patients with subclavian artery stenosis. METHODS: Using the brachial (n = 25), radial (n = 3), femoral (n = 96), or combined (n = 28) approach, PTA was performed in consecutive 152 [bilateral n = 27, unilateral n = 125, 88 male, aged 17 approximately 82 (58 +/- 16) years old] subclavian artery stenosis patients with 179 lesions. Stenosis was caused by atheroma in 114 of 152 patients (75%) and by aortoarteritis in the other patients (25%). The indications for intervention were arm claudication in 130 of 152 patients (85.5%), subclavian steal in 138 of 152 patients (90.8%), blue finger syndrome in 2 of 152 patients (1.3%), coronary steal syndrome in 2 of 162 patients (1.3%), or anticipated coronary artery bypass grafting using the internal mammary artery in 10 asymptomatic patients (6.6%). All patients were followed up for at least 9 months after procedure. RESULTS: PTA was succeeded in 142 of 152 patients (93.4%) and procedural success rate was 100% in 133 stenotic lesions (diameter reduction 70% approximately 99%) and 78.2% in total occlusive lesions (36/46). Stents were deployed in 145 of 169 lesions. In the 142 patients successfully treated with PTA, the percent diameter stenosis was reduced from (90 +/- 8)% to (6 +/- 8)%, and lesions diameter improved from (1.0 +/- 0.9) mm to (7.0 +/- 0.5) mm (all P values < 0.001). No severe procedure related complications were observed. During 9 months follow-up in these 142 patients with successful PTA, sustained clinical improvement was seen in 135 patients and restenosis occurred in 7 patients with aortoarteritis (n = 4) and atheroma (n = 3). CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is effective and safe for the treatment of subclavian artery stenosis.",
