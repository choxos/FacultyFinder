  "title": "Surgical site infection rates are higher among elective colorectal surgery patients receiving non-beta-lactam-based antimicrobial prophylaxis: A retrospective chart review.",
  "abstract": "We compared the odds of acquiring surgical site infection (SSI) for clean-contaminated colorectal surgeries between intravenous Î²-lactam-based prophylaxis (BLP) versus alternative antimicrobial prophylaxis (AAP). We calculated the odds of acquiring an SSI using logistic regression; adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. Increased odds of SSI were detected with AAP versus BLP (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.33-3.50; P = .002).",
