  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of urinary disorders on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' health-related quality of life and to examine the cross-sectional construct validity of Qualiveen, a questionnaire originally developed for spinal cord injury patients with urinary disorders, in patients with MS. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Neurourodynamic units in 3 French university hospitals. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with MS (N=197). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We tested predictions about the relationships among clinical features, the French version of the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life questionnaire (SEP-59), the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and the 4 domains of the 30-item Qualiveen. RESULTS: Cross-sectional correlations among the 4 Qualiveen domains and type (range, .36-.54), number of symptoms (range, .23-.50), and severity of incontinence (.39-.68) were generally moderate to strong. The SEP-59 bowel and bladder function domain showed moderate to strong relationships with the Qualiveen (range, .39-.59). Relationships with other SEP-59 domains were generally weak (range, .22-.35), and with the EDSS they were very weak. Predictions proved generally accurate (weighted kappa=.61). CONCLUSIONS: Our data supported the Qualiveen's validity as a discriminative instrument for use with patients with MS. Further studies should explore the Qualiveen's longitudinal validity and responsiveness.",
