  "abstract": "The chemokine receptor CXCR4 belongs to the family of seven-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). It is activated by its natural ligand SDF-1α. In addition, CXCR4, along with CCR5, serve as coreceptors during HIV-1 entry into its target cell. Recently, we introduced a CXCR4 mimetic peptide, termed CX4-M1, which presents the three extracellular loops (ECLs) of the receptor. CX4-M1 was shown to selectively bind to gp120 of X4-tropic, that is, CXCR4 using, HIV-1, as well as to peptides that present the V3-loops of these gp120 proteins. Furthermore, CX4-M1 selectively inhibits infection of cells with X4-tropic HIV-1. We have now adapted the sequence of the ECLs presented by CX4-M1 to the recently published crystal structure of CXCR4. The binding behavior, as well as the effect on HIV-1 infection, of the resulting peptide (CX4-Mc) was very similar to CX4-M1, validating retrospectively the original design of CX4-M1. A peptide presenting the ECLs of CCR5 (CR5-M), on the other hand, did neither bind to gp120 from X4-tropic HIV-1, nor did it inhibit infection of cells with X4-tropic HIV-1. Furthermore, we could show that CX4-M1, as well as CX4-Mc, but not CR5-M, are selectively recognized by anti-CXCR4 antibodies, bind to SDF-1α, and also inhibit SDF-1α signaling, extending the scope of selective functional CXCR4 mimicry through CX4-M1.",
