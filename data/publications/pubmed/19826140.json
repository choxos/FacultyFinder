  "abstract": "PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED: Family medicine departments and primary health care research centres across the country are growing in size and complexity and therefore require increasingly sophisticated management strategies. Conducting effective and relevant research relies on a stable and efficient organization. OBJECTIVE OF THE PROGRAM To focus on the needs of individuals, teams, and the organization in order to ensure the success of research projects. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: In order to ensure the success of research projects, the C.T. Lamont Primary Health Care Research Centre (CTLC) in Ottawa, Ont, used the following strategies: ensuring organizational support (ie, protected time for research and sustained funding for some investigators); arranging financial and infrastructure support; building skills and confidence (eg, education sessions); organizing linkages and collaborations (eg, forums among staff members); creating appropriate dissemination (eg, newsletter, website); and providing continuity and sustainability. CONCLUSION: In order to ensure progress in primary health care research, the CTLC created solutions that focused on the individual, team, and organizational levels. With its management strategies, the CTLC was successful in maintaining a high-functioning team and a well-organized research organization.",
