  "title": "Non-pharmacological management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: Patient perspectives and experiences.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To understand perceptions on rehabilitation after vertebral fracture, non-pharmacological strategies, and virtual care from the perspective of individuals living with vertebral fractures. DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted semi-structured interviews online and performed a thematic and content analysis from a post-positivism perspective. PARTICIPANTS: Ten individuals living with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (9F, 1 M, aged 71  ±  8 years). RESULTS: Five themes emerged: pain is the defining limitation of vertebral fracture recovery; delayed diagnosis impacts recovery trajectory; living with fear; being dissatisfied with fracture management; and \"getting back into the game of life\" using non-pharmacological strategies. CONCLUSION: Participants reported back pain and an inability to perform activities of daily living, affecting psychological and social well-being. Physiotherapy, education, and exercise were considered helpful and important to patients; however, issues with fracture identification and referral limited the use of these options. Participants believed that virtual rehabilitation was a feasible and effective alternative to in-person care, but perceived experience with technology, cost, and individualization of programs as barriers.",
