  "title": "Disulfiram: Mechanisms, Applications, and Challenges.",
  "abstract": "Background: Since disulfiram's discovery in the 1940s and its FDA approval for alcohol use disorder, other indications have been investigated. This review describes potential clinical applications, associated risks, and challenges. Methods: For this narrative review, a PubMed search was conducted for articles addressing in vivo studies of disulfiram with an emphasis on drug repurposing for the treatment of human diseases. The key search terms were \"disulfiram\" and \"Antabuse\". Animal studies and in vitro studies highlighting important mechanisms and safety issues were also included. Results: In total, 196 sources addressing our research focus spanning 1948-2022 were selected for inclusion. In addition to alcohol use disorder, emerging data support a potential role for disulfiram in the treatment of other addictions (e.g., cocaine), infections (e.g., bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Borrelia burgdorferi, viruses, parasites), inflammatory conditions, neurological diseases, and cancers. The side effects range from minor to life-threatening, with lower doses conveying less risk. Caution in human use is needed due to the considerable inter-subject variability in disulfiram pharmacokinetics. Conclusions: While disulfiram has promise as a \"repurposed\" agent in human disease, its risk profile is of concern. Animal studies and well-controlled clinical trials are needed to assess its safety and efficacy for non-alcohol-related indications.",
