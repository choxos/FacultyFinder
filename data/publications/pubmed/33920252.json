  "title": "Design of a Wideband Tonpilz Transducer Comprising Non-Uniform Piezoceramic Stacks with Equivalent Circuits.",
  "abstract": "Tonpilz transducers are desirable for their superior performance in underwater target detection and communication applications. Several design schemes to widen their bandwidth have been reported, but these schemes often involve a complex structure or arrangement of additional components. In this study, a simple design is proposed to improve the bandwidth of a multimode Tonpilz transducer by using a non-uniform drive section that consists of piezoelectric stacks of various thicknesses. The efficacy of the design is illustrated with a multimode Tonpilz transducer having three lead zirconate titanate (PZT) stacks of different thicknesses. A new equivalent circuit was developed to analyze the frequency response of the transducer incorporating the non-uniform drive section and was used for rigorous analysis of the effects of varying the position and thickness of the non-uniform stacks on the transmitting characteristics of the transducer. The validity of the design was verified through the fabrication and characterization of a prototype multimode Tonpilz transducer. The developed structure can be readily extended to an arbitrary number of stacks in the Tonpilz transducer with any number of PZT disks in each stack.",
