  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment de-intensification, including transoral robotic surgery (TORS), may outcomes in HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Early return to work (RTW) improves quality of life in oncology patients. Our objective was to compare the RTW time in OPSCC patients undergoing primary TORS or chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We investigated the role of treatment modality on self-reported swallowing function. METHODS: All patients were adults diagnosed with early-stage (T1-2, N0-2) OPSCC and treated via primary TORS or CRT. We performed 1:1 exact case matching based on tumor stage and subsite. We collected RTW outcomes for all patients. We also reported MD Anderson Dysphagia Index (MDADI) scores up to 24 months from the end of treatment. We performed statistical analyses and comparison of RTW and MDADI outcomes based on treatment group. RESULTS: Overall, 26 patients undergoing primary TORS and 25 undergoing primary CRT were included. We found a significant improvement in RTW in TORS patients compared to CRT (TORS: 54 days (1.8 months), IQR: 30.8; CRT: 164 days (5.4 months), IQR: 109; W=587, p = 9.28e-08) independent of HPV status, tonsillar subsite, and radiotherapy alone. Primary TORS had a 16.2-fold (95 % CI: 5.78-45.5) higher likelihood of returning to work than primary CRT patients. Primary TORS also had better MDADI scores within two years of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In OPSCC, primary TORS accelerated RTW and improved swallowing when compared to primary CRT. The potential economic advantage of returning to work sooner should be discussed when reviewing treatment options with patients.",
