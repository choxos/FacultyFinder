  "title": "Characterization of Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria in Constructed Wetland Microcosms Used to Treat Crude Oil Polluted Water.",
  "abstract": "Ten plant species were grown in constructed wetlands (CWs) to remediate water containing 2% (w/v) crude oil. The plant species with better growth and biomass production were Typha latifolia and Cyperus laevigatus, and they were significantly correlated (R[2] = 0.91) with hydrocarbon degradation. From T. latifolia and C. laevigatus, 33 hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere, and root and shoot interiors. More diversified bacteria were found in the rhizosphere and endosphere of C. laevigatus than those of T. latifolia. The predominant cultural hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were shown to belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Bacillus. In addition to genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, most of the bacteria displayed multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) activities. This study suggests the importance of selecting suitable bacterial strains with hydrocarbon degradation and PGP activities for improving the efficacy of CWs used in remediating water contaminated with crude oil.",
