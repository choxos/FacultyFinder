  "abstract": "Standard operating procedures (SOPs) play an important role in clinical research due to their role in promoting good clinical practice. Due to their importance, it will be explored in this article how and why this is the case, in addition to examining the value of SOPs in conducting an effective clinical trial. This will be done by first introducing the concept of SOPs, which is followed by a discussion of their advantages and how to best develop and use them.",
