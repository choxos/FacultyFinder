  "title": "Emotional geographies of loss in later life: An intimate account of rural older peoples' last move.",
  "abstract": "Providing a rural example of the interconnection between aging, emotion, time and place, this paper explores the intimate experiences of loss as older adults move into long-term care settings. Drawing on findings from a qualitative case study of transitions in care in rural Canada, we demonstrate the spatial and temporal dimensions of the experiences of older adults and their carers. In so doing, we highlight the benefits of embracing emotional geographies of care as a new lens in transitions in care research and outline emergent questions for research, policy and practice that will enhance knowledge in the field.",
