  "abstract": "Physical activity (PA) is a key health promotion strategy for preventing non-communicable diseases such as obesity. However, certain populations, such as immigrants, may participate less and have lower levels of PA. The objective of this study was to co-design a PA program aimed at increasing PA participation among immigrant children in Canada. This program was developed in partnership with community members (caregivers and children), service providers, and community leaders. Using an experience-based co-design (EBCD) approach, participants identified key issues and challenges related to PA in their community and then co-designed programs and activities that addressed these concerns. Three co-design workshops were held to explore barriers and facilitators to PA and a healthy lifestyle. In small groups, 49 participants led the design of seasonal community programs, including swimming, soccer, gardening, and tennis. Through the workshops, a tailored program was developed in collaboration with the community to address barriers and facilitators to PA for immigrant families. By actively involving relevant community members in the design and development process, the co-design workshops aimed to create a PA program that is more likely to be effective, accepted, and sustainable in promoting PA and a healthy lifestyle for immigrant children and families.",
