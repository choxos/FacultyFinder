  "title": "A Study of the Effect of Treatment On the Clinical Profile, Pain, and Disability in Migraine Patients Seen in a Tertiary Hospital.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Migraine is a disabling disease that poses a significant societal burden. Migraine is a major cause of disability. Migraine is the eighth leading disease-causing disability in the population. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile and measure the pain and migraine-related disability of patients with all types of migraine using the McGill pain assessment scale and Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) before and after 3 months of effect on the medication. METHODS: A Prospective-Cross sectional study was carried out in a multispecialty hospital with male and female patients between 18 and 65 years. The data were collected from the patients directly through the questionnaire of McGill pain assessment scale-short form (SF) and MIDAS, which was provided before and after the medication. RESULTS: There were 165 subjects of which 52 were men and 113 were women. The mean age of all the subjects was 43 years. About 26.06% of the subjects had a family history of headaches. The scores of McGill pain and MIDAS assessment before and after medication were as follows: 0-15 were 30.90% and 73.33%, Score 16-30 were 54.54% and 18.18%, the score of 31-45 were 14.54% and 7.87% of the subjects. MIDAS grade I was 17.57% and 50.90%, Grade II 33.93% and 21.81%, Grade III 30.30% and 15.75% Grade IV 18.18% and 11.51% of the subjects. DISCUSSION: The calculated \"t\" value between the before and after medication values of McGill and MIDAS by paired 't-test was 13.85 and 17.49 respectively. As the calculated \"t\" value is more than the table value, the alternate hypothesis is accepted. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that there is a significant difference in disability levels before and after acute and preventative treatments when measured over 3 months. In addition, the preponderance of females was high, and the functional disability that affects work and social activity associated with migraine is moderate to severe.",
