  "abstract": "The goal of this study was to determine the effect of hirsutidin on ethanol-induced stomach ulcers in rats. Rats (n = 24 rats/group) were separated at random into the following groups: normal saline-treated (normal control), ethanol-treated (ethanol control), 10 mg/kg hirsutidin + ethanol-treated (hirsutidin 10), and 20 mg/kg hirsutidin + ethanol-treated (hirsutidin 20). All the groups received the respective treatment orally for 7 days. On day 7, i.e., after 24 h of fasting, except for the normal control group, all the groups orally received 5 mL/kg of ethanol. Four hours later, rats were anaesthetized, serum was isolated from the blood, and biochemical tests were performed. The stomach tissue was utilized for ulcer grading, histology, and biochemical analysis. The rats developed stomach acidity and ulcers after being given ethanol based on increased ulcer score, disturbed cellular architecture, increased oxidative stress, myeloperoxidase and decreased endogenous antioxidants, and nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 concentration. Ethanol-treated rats also displayed increased tumor necrosis factor-Î±, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, and inflammatory cytokines. The treatment with hirsutidin protected and significantly restored all serum parameters in ethanol-induced stomach ulcers and may have antiulcer activity.",
