  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection commonly affecting structures in the head and neck such as air sinuses, orbits, and the brain. Common predisposing factors include diabetes and immunosuppression. To date, only one case of mucormycosis involving the parotid gland has been reported, and this infection was associated with a fatal outcome. METHODS: We report a case of parotid gland mucormycosis in a 45-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, who was successfully treated with a superficial parotidectomy and intravenous amphotericin B. RESULTS: After initial surgical and antifungal therapy, the patient was left with a residual facial nerve palsy for which multiple sling procedures were performed. She is currently alive and well 6 years after the diagnosis of mucormycosis. CONCLUSIONS: Mucormycosis of the parotid gland is a rare form of this often-fatal infection. In this case, infection remained isolated to the parotid gland and was diagnosed soon after presentation. The patient most likely survived because of the early diagnosis, successful surgical removal of all infected tissue, use of intravenous amphotericin therapy, and the aggressive management of comorbidities such as her diabetes.",
