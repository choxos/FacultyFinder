  "title": "Clinical supervision for transition to advanced practice.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This reflective paper offers a conceptual framework of clinical supervision that assists supervisors to create supportive relationships necessary for advanced practice development. CONCLUSIONS: Combining established concepts of clinical supervision with systems psychodynamics enhances the supervisory experience. It is useful to supervisors to understand role transition as it sensitizes them to what their supervisees experience. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Nurses require support in role transition, especially when the systems into which they are introduced can struggle with new advanced roles. This framework offers a broadened lens that allows for the richness and complexities that go with the development of advanced practice to be explored and better understood.",
