  "abstract": "THIS REPORT COMPILES AND SUMMARIZES ALL PUBLISHED RECOMMENDATIONS FROM CDC’S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES (ACIP) FOR USE OF PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINES IN ADULTS AGED ≥19 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES. THIS REPORT ALSO INCLUDES UPDATED AND NEW CLINICAL GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION FROM CDC:  BEFORE 2021, ACIP RECOMMENDED 23-VALENT PNEUMOCOCCAL POLYSACCHARIDE VACCINE (PPSV23) ALONE (UP TO 2 DOSES), OR BOTH A SINGLE DOSE OF 13-VALENT PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINE (PCV13) IN COMBINATION WITH 1–3 DOSES OF PPSV23 IN SERIES (PCV13 FOLLOWED BY PPSV23), FOR USE IN U.S. ADULTS DEPENDING ON AGE AND UNDERLYING RISK FOR PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE. IN 2021, TWO NEW PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINES (PCVS), A 15-VALENT AND A 20-VALENT PCV (PCV15 AND PCV20), WERE LICENSED FOR USE IN U.S. ADULTS AGED ≥18 YEARS BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION:  ACIP RECOMMENDATIONS SPECIFY THE USE OF EITHER PCV20 ALONE OR PCV15 IN SERIES WITH PPSV23 FOR ALL ADULTS AGED ≥65 YEARS AND FOR ADULTS AGED 19–64 YEARS WITH CERTAIN UNDERLYING MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR OTHER RISK FACTORS WHO HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PCV OR WHOSE VACCINATION HISTORY IS UNKNOWN. IN ADDITION, ACIP RECOMMENDS USE OF EITHER A SINGLE DOSE OF PCV20 OR ≥1 DOSE OF PPSV23 FOR ADULTS WHO HAVE STARTED THEIR PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE SERIES WITH PCV13 BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ALL RECOMMENDED PPSV23 DOSES. SHARED CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING IS RECOMMENDED REGARDING USE OF A SUPPLEMENTAL PCV20 DOSE FOR ADULTS AGED ≥65 YEARS WHO HAVE COMPLETED THEIR RECOMMENDED VACCINE SERIES WITH BOTH PCV13 AND PPSV23:  UPDATED AND NEW CLINICAL GUIDANCE FOR IMPLEMENTATION FROM CDC INCLUDES THE RECOMMENDATION FOR USE OF PCV15 OR PCV20 FOR ADULTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED PPSV23 BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY PCV DOSE. THE REPORT ALSO INCLUDES CLINICAL GUIDANCE FOR ADULTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED 7-VALENT PCV (PCV7) ONLY AND ADULTS WHO ARE HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS:",
