  "title": "Preclinical Studies on Mechanisms Underlying the Protective Effects of Propranolol in Traumatic Brain Injury: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity amongst trauma patients. Its treatment is focused on minimizing progression to secondary injury. Administration of propranolol for TBI maydecrease mortality and improve functional outcomes. However, it is our sense that its use has not been universally adopted due to low certainty evidence. The literature was reviewed to explore the mechanism of propranolol as a therapeutic intervention in TBI to guide future clinical investigations. Medline, Embase, and Scopus were searched for studies that investigated the effect of propranolol on TBI in animal models from inception until June 6, 2023. All routes of administration for propranolol were included and the following outcomes were evaluated: cognitive functions, physiological and immunological responses. Screening and data extraction were done independently and in duplicate. The risk of bias for each individual study was assessed using the SYCLE's risk of bias tool for animal studies. Three hundred twenty-three citations were identified and 14 studies met our eligibility criteria. The data suggests that propranolol may improve post-TBI cognitive and motor function by increasing cerebral perfusion, reducing neural injury, cell death, leukocyte mobilization and p-tau accumulation in animal models. Propranolol may also attenuate TBI-induced immunodeficiency and provide cardioprotective effects by mitigating damage to the myocardium caused by oxidative stress. This systematic review demonstrates that propranolol may be therapeutic in TBI by improving cognitive and motor function while regulating T lymphocyte response and levels of myocardial reactive oxygen species. Oral or intravenous injection of propranolol following TBI is associated with improved cerebral perfusion, reduced neuroinflammation, reduced immunodeficiency, and cardio-neuroprotection in preclinical studies.",
