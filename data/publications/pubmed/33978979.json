  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate associations between geographic rurality and tobacco use patterns among adolescents. METHODS: High school students (N = 566) from north-central Appalachia reported on their lifetime and/or current use of cigarettes, electronic cigarettes (ECIGs), cigars, and smokeless tobacco. Geographic rurality was measured via the Isolation scale, whereby residential ZIP Codes determined the degree to which respondents have access to health-related resources. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify discrete classes of adolescent tobacco users based on their use of tobacco products. Then, associations between participants' geographic rurality and class membership were evaluated using a series of multinomial logistic regressions. FINDINGS: LCA classified participants as Nonusers, Current ECIG Users, Cigarette/ECIG Experimenters, and Polytobacco Users. Individuals with higher Isolation scores were more likely to be Polytobacco Users and Cigarette/ECIG Experimenters than Nonusers, and were more likely to be Polytobacco Users than Current ECIG Users. CONCLUSIONS: The continuous Isolation scale used in the present study predicted polytobacco use patterns among adolescents in a manner that is consistent with, while simultaneously expanding upon, prior work. Tobacco control practices and policies should be viewed through a lens that considers the unique needs of geographically isolated areas.",
