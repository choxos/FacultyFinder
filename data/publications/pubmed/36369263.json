  "title": "Role of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor in the management of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy without centre-involving diabetic macular oedema: a meta-analysis of trials.",
  "abstract": "This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the impact of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment in management of eyes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) without centre involving diabetic macular oedema (CI-DMO). We searched multiple databases for all randomised clinical trials (RCTs) that evaluated anti-VEGF treatment versus observation in eyes with NPDR without CI-DMO. Data was collected for six outcomes (best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvement, diabetic retinopathy severity score (DRSS), central subfield thickness, progression to vision threatening complications (VTCs), ocular adverse events and quality of life measures). Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 2) and certainty of evidence was assessed using Grade of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We identified a total of 2 unique RCTs that compared aflibercept and sham to treat a total of 811 eyes. For BCVA change, there was a small, clinically insignificant benefit for aflibercept treatment at year 2 (MD 0.70, 95% CI 0.02-1.38, GRADE rating: MODERATE). DRSS demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with aflibercept use at year 2 (RR 3.76, 95% CI 2.75-5.13, GRADE rating: MODERATE). VTCs were significantly less in aflibercept arm at year 2 (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.23-0.40, GRADE rating: MODERATE). In conclusion, aflibercept treatment versus observation in eyes with NPDR without CI-DMO can result in reduced risk of development of VTCs and regression of DRSS score over 2 years. Future trials are needed to increase the precision of the treatment effect and to provide data on quality-of-life metrics.PROSPERO Registration: CRD42021288608.",
