  "title": "Effect of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills on cardiac function after acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: A randomized trial.",
  "abstract": "The current study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Compound Danshen Dripping Pills (CDDP) in improving cardiac function among patients with acute anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (AAMI). Between February 2021 and February 2023, 247 eligible patients with AAMI after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI) were enrolled and randomly assigned (1âˆ¶1) to receive CDDP (n = 126) or placebo (n = 121), with a follow-up of 48 weeks. Compared with the placebo group, the CDDP group demonstrated a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values after 24 weeks of the treatment (least squares mean: 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.72-4.90; P < 0.001) and at the 48-week follow-up (least squares mean: 4.35; 95% CI: 2.76-5.94; P < 0.001). Significant reductions of N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels were observed in both groups at the 24- and 48-week visits without difference between the two groups (P > 0.1 for all), and 6.35% and 5.79% of patients in the CDDP and placebo groups experienced major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, respectively (P = 0.822). Therefore, no serious adverse events were attributed to CDDP. These findings sugget that CDDP was well tolerated and improved LVEF of patients with AAMI in 24 and 48 weeks.",
