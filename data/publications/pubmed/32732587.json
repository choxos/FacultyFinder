  "title": "Fixation Using Alternative Implants for the Treatment of Hip Fractures (FAITH-2): The Clinical Outcomes of a Multicenter 2 Ã— 2 Factorial Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial in Young Femoral Neck Fracture Patients.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess whether the fixation method and vitamin D supplementation affect the risk of patient-important outcomes within 12 months of injury in nongeriatric femoral neck fracture patients. DESIGN: A pilot factorial randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Fifteen North American clinical sites. PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one adults 18-60 years of age with a femoral neck fracture requiring surgical fixation. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized to a surgical intervention (sliding hip screw or cancellous screws) and a vitamin D intervention (vitamin D3 4000 IU daily vs. placebo for 6 months). MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The primary clinical outcome was a composite of patient-important complications (reoperation, femoral head osteonecrosis, severe femoral neck malunion, and nonunion). Secondary outcomes included fracture-healing complications and radiographic fracture healing. RESULTS: Eighty-six participants with a mean age of 41 years were included. We found no statistically significant difference in the risk of patient-important outcomes between the surgical treatment arms (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.40-2.02, P = 0.80) and vitamin D supplementation treatment arms (hazard ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.42-2.18, P = 0.92). CONCLUSIONS: These pilot trial results continue to describe the results of current fixation implants, inform the challenges of improving outcomes in this fracture population, and may guide future vitamin D trials to improve healing outcomes in young fracture populations. Although the pilot trial was not adequately powered to detect treatment effects, publishing these results may facilitate future meta-analyses on this topic. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.
