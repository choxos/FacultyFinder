  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The performance of a mastectomy for the treatment or prophylaxis of breast cancer may have long-term implications for both physical and mental well-being in women. The development of breast numbness and phantom breast sensations following mastectomy is well-known; however, relatively little is known about physical morbidity following postmastectomy breast reconstruction. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the level of physical morbidity experienced following three surgical approaches: mastectomy alone, postmastectomy tissue expander/implant reconstruction, and postmastectomy autogenous tissue reconstruction. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a sample of women who had undergone mastectomy with or without reconstruction. Chest and upper body morbidity were evaluated using the BREAST-Q. Physical well-being was compared across three types of breast surgery. RESULTS: In total, 308 of 452 women who received a questionnaire booklet returned completed questionnaires. There was an overall difference in physical morbidity attributable to surgical treatment (P < 0.001). Patients who underwent autogenous tissue reconstruction had the highest (i.e., best) mean physical well-being score. Women who underwent expander/implant reconstruction also had less chronic physical morbidity than women who underwent mastectomy alone (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that women who undergo immediate autogenous tissue reconstruction experience significantly less chest and upper body morbidity than those who undergo either mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction or mastectomy alone. This information can be used to facilitate clinical decision-making, to validate individual experiences of breast cancer survivors, and to inform future innovations to decrease the long-term physical morbidity associated with breast cancer surgery.",
