  "title": "Caregiving in long-term care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic: a scoping review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic magnified pre-existing socioeconomic, operational, and structural challenges in long-term care across the world. In Canada, the long-term care sector's dependence on caregivers as a supplement to care workers became apparent once restrictive visitation policies were employed. We conducted a scoping review to better understand the associations between caregiving and resident, formal and informal caregiver health in long-term care before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, AgeLine, Google Advanced, ArXiv, PROSPERO, and OSF. Pairs of independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts followed by a review of full texts. Studies were included if they reported biological, psychological, or social health outcomes associated with caregiving (or lack thereof). RESULTS: After screening and reviewing 252 records identified by the search strategy, a total of 20 full-text records were eligible and included in this review. According to our results, research on caregiving increased during the pandemic, and researchers noted restrictive visitation policies had an adverse impact on health outcomes for residents and formal and informal caregivers. In comparison, caregiving in long-term care prior to the pandemic, and once visitation policies became less restrictive, led to mostly beneficial health outcomes. CONCLUSION: Caregiver interventions, for the most part, appear to promote better health outcomes for long-term care residents and formal and informal caregivers. Suggestions to better support caregiving in long-term care settings are offered.",
