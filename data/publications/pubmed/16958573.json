  "abstract": "An exploratory factor analysis was performed in a clinical sample of 314 children and adolescents to investigate the factor structure of the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R; Poznanski et al. 1984). A maximum likelihood method followed by a Promax rotation yielded five factors: observed depressive mood, anhedonia, morbid thoughts, somatic symptoms and reported depressive mood. The age group and gender differences on the factors scores are evaluated. After controlling for gender, the adolescents had more severe depression in terms of observed depressive mood, anhedonia, and somatic symptoms. After controlling for age groups, girls had higher scores for reported depressive mood.",
