  "title": "Consuming a Protein and Fiber-Based Supplement Preload Promotes Weight Loss and Alters Metabolic Markers in Overweight Adults in a 12-Week, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher protein and fiber diets promote weight management and metabolic health. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine if greater weight loss and positive changes in metabolic outcomes could be achieved with twice-daily consumption of a high-protein and fiber-based multi-ingredient nutritional shake (HPF) compared with an isocaloric low-protein, lower fiber-based placebo (LPF). METHODS: Study procedures were conducted by an independent research organization under clinicaltrials.gov registration NCT03057873. Healthy overweight and obese adults [n = 206; BMI (kg/m2): 27-35; 70% female] were randomly assigned to HPF or LPF. All participants were prescribed an energy-restricted diet (500 kcal/d less than energy needs) and consumed a HPF (17 g protein, 6 g fiber) or LPF (1 g protein, 3 g fiber) shake 30 min before breakfast and lunch for 12 wk. Primary outcomes included body weight and total body fat percentage. Blood samples were collected at days (D) 0, 28, 56, and 84 for secondary analyses related to metabolic markers of health. RESULTS: Although weight loss occurred in both groups, HPF had greater weight loss at D84 compared with LPF (-3.3 kg vs. -1.8 kg, P < 0.05). Percentage body fat decreased in both groups (HPF: -1.33%, LPF: -1.09%; P < 0.001) with no differences between groups. Serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and oxidized LDL decreased between -5.1% to -8.3%, whereas adiponectin increased over time in both groups; these changes occurred to a greater extent in HPF compared with LPF (all P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A multi-ingredient HPF nutritional supplement shake consumed as a preload before breakfast and lunch positively influenced weight management and metabolic outcomes in overweight adults compared with an LPF placebo. These findings suggest that specific nutrient factors (i.e., potentially including protein, fiber, and bioactive content) other than calorie reduction alone influence the success of a weight-loss regimen. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03057873.",
