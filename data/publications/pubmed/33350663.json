  "title": "The Factors That Influenced Medical Students' Decision to Work Within the NHS During the COVID-19 Pandemic-A National, Cross-sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Medical students across the United Kingdom helped the National Health Service (NHS) with the increased workload caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This study was conducted to better understand the implications of COVID-19 on the intricate relationship between the psychological wellbeing of students and working within the NHS. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, national UK study analyzing the self-reported pandemic anxiety scale (PAS) of participants during the pandemic, using an online questionnaire. RESULTS: 25.2% of participants worked within the NHS. Working significantly reduced anxiety levels of participants. Concerns around the training and information provided on personal protective equipment (PPE) (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] OR: 1.93, 3.43) (P < 0.001) and Ethnicity (OR 2.15, 95% CI OR: 1.54, 2.99) (P < 0.001) were the most significant covariates affecting the likelihood of working. CONCLUSION: Working during the pandemic was influenced by age, ethnicity, and information surrounding PPE. On average those who worked experienced less anxiety and were more cheerful and energetic.",
