  "title": "Exploring Student and Faculty Perceptions of Clinical Simulation: A Q-Sort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Simulation learning has become a widely accepted and valuable methodology within nursing education. This study assessed whether student and faculty perceptions regarding simulation learning have changed since curricular integration of simulation activities within an undergraduate nursing program. METHOD: Q-methodology was used to identify unique and similar perspectives of 12 faculty and 21 students. Participants completed a brief demographic questionnaire and sorted statements related to beliefs about simulation-based learning. RESULTS: Faculty perceptions were captured within one viewpoint-positive enthusiasts. Three student viewpoints were identified: challenge seekers, realistic embracers, and support seekers. Both students and faculty believed that simulation improved critical thinking. CONCLUSION: The findings suggest that faculty should be aware of the range of student perceptions and tailor their teaching approaches accordingly to maximize student learning.",
