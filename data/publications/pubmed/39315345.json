  "title": "End-of-Life Care Among Patients With Kidney Failure on Maintenance Dialysis: A Retrospective Population-Based Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nephrologists routinely provide end-of-life care for patients with kidney failure (KF) on maintenance dialysis. Involvement of primary care and palliative care physicians may enhance this experience. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe outpatient care patterns in the last year of life and the end-of-life acute care utilization for patients with KF on maintenance dialysis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study using population-level health administrative data. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Outpatient and inpatient care during the last year of life among patients who died between 2017 and 2019, receiving maintenance dialysis in Ontario, Canada. MEASUREMENTS: The primary exposure is patterns of physician specialties providing outpatient care in the last year of life. Outcomes include outpatient encounters in the last year of life, acute care visitation in the last month of life, and place of death. METHODS: We reported the count and percentage of categorical outcomes and the median (interquartile range) for numeric outcomes. We produced time series plots of the mean monthly percentage of encounters to different specialties stratified by physician specialty patterns. We evaluated differences in outcomes by physician specialty patterns using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Pearson's chi-square tests (P < .05, two-tailed). RESULTS: Among 6866 patients, the median age at death was 73, 36.1% were female, and 87.8% resided in urban regions. Three patterns emerged: a primary care, nephrology, and palliative care triad (25.5%); a primary care and nephrology dyad (59.3%); and a non-primary care pattern (15.2%). Palliative care involvement is concentrated near death. Of all, 81.4% spent at least 1 day in hospital or emergency department in the last month, but those with primary care, palliative care, and nephrology involvement had the fewest acute care deaths (65.8%). LIMITATIONS: Outpatient care patterns were defined using physician billing codes, potentially missing care from other providers. CONCLUSIONS: Nephrology and primary care predominantly manage outpatient care in the last year of life for patients with KF on maintenance dialysis, with consistent acute care use across care patterns except for the place of death. Future research should explore associations between patterns of care and end-of-life outcomes to identify the most optimal model of care for patients with KF on maintenance dialysis.",
