  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of different types of gastric varices in patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. METHODS: The observational cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2014 to August 2015 at Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital, Gujrat, Pakistan, using non-probability consecutive sampling. Patients having liver cirrhosis only due to chronic hepatitis C virus, portal vein diameter >12mm or spleen size >12cm in long axis and ascites with no previous history of variceal banding were included. Patients having cirrhosis due to other causes were excluded. Data was collected using a proforma that was filled by taking history, laboratory studies, abdominal ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastric varices were classified using Sarin classification. SPSS 20 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Out of 205 patients undergoing esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, 122(59.5%) were male and 83(40.5%) were female with an overall mean age of 49.5Â±7.49 years. Gastric varices were present in 30(14.6%) patients. Among them, type 1 was present in 23(76.71%), type 2 in 6(19.86%) and isolated gastric varices type 1 in 3(10.27%).Isolated gastric varices type 2 was not present in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: Gastric varices were present in minority of patients undergoing esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, and among them, gastroesophageal varices type 1 was the most common, while isolated gastric varices type 2 was not present in any patient.",
