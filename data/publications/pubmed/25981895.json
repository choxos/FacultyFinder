  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined the measurement invariance of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and Youth Self-Report (YSR) DSM-oriented scales between extremely low birth weight (ELBW) and normal birth weight (NBW) youth. METHODS: â€ƒThe sample included 158 ELBW survivors and 145 matched, NBW controls at 8 and 12-16 years of age. RESULTS: Strict invariance was established at 8 years for parent-reported CBCL attention-deficit hyperactivity, conduct, and oppositional defiant scales, though invariance could not be established for affective problems at 8 or 12-16 years. Strict invariance was observed between 12-16-year-old ELBW and NBW groups on attention-deficit hyperactivity, anxiety, and oppositional defiant CBCL and YSR scales. Invariance could not be established for youth-reported conduct problems. CONCLUSIONS: While the majority of CBCL/YSR DSM-oriented subscales assess the same concepts in both ELBW and NBW children and adolescents across parent and youth reports, this may not be the case for affective and conduct problems.",
