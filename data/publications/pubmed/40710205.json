  "abstract": "Sexual dysfunction is a prevalent and often under-addressed concern among prostate cancer survivors, significantly affecting quality of life for patients and their partners. The True North Sexual Health and Rehabilitation eClinic (SHAReClinic) is a virtual, biopsychosocial intervention developed to improve access to sexual health support for prostate cancer survivors and their partners. This study used a qualitative descriptive design to examine barriers and facilitators influencing the integration of SHAReClinic into oncology care across nine Canadian health care centres. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 knowledge users, including health care providers and institutional leaders. Data were analyzed using a hybrid deductive-inductive thematic approach guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) 2.0. Participants described SHAReClinic as a much-needed resource, particularly in the absence of standardized sexual health pathways in oncology care. The virtual format was seen as accessible and well suited to addressing sensitive topics. However, limited funding, lack of institutional support, and workflow integration challenges emerged as primary barriers to implementation. Findings offer practical, theory-informed guidance for integrating SHAReClinic into oncology care and highlight key considerations for developing sustainable and scalable survivorship care models.",
