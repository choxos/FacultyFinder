  "title": "Wedge Defects on Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of the Peripapillary Retina in Glaucoma: Prevalence and Associated Clinical Factors.",
  "abstract": "PRCIS: Among subjects with glaucoma, wedge-shaped defects on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) were associated with disc hemorrhages (DH), paracentral visual field (VF) defects, increased cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), and thinner retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL). PURPOSE: To examine determinants of wedge defects on peripapillary OCTA in glaucoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 278 eyes of 186 subjects with mild to severe primary open-angle glaucoma underwent 6×6 spectral-domain OCTA imaging of the superficial peripapillary retina from 2016 to 2020 at an academic practice. Wedge defects were defined as focal microvasculature loss that extends outward from the optic nerve in an arcuate, wedge shape. Logistic regression models controlling for intereye correlation identified variables significantly associated with wedge defects. Eyes with profound microvasculature loss in both hemispheres were excluded. Candidate variables included: age, sex, race or ethnicity, diabetes, hypertension, follow-up duration, baseline untreated intraocular pressure, intraocular pressure at time of imaging, DH history, paracentral VF defects, CDR, central corneal thickness, spherical equivalent, VF mean deviation, RNFL thickness, and glaucoma stage. RESULTS: Of 278 eyes, 126 (45.3%) had wedge defects in at least 1 hemisphere. In our multivariable logistic regression model, wedge defects were associated with DH history [odds ratio (OR): 3.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.05-9.69, P=0.041], paracentral VF defects [OR: 4.38 (95% CI: 2.11-9.11), P<0.0001], larger CDR [OR: 1.27 (95% CI: 1.03-1.56), P=0.024, per 0.1 increase], and thinner RNFL [OR: 1.71 (95% CI: 1.25-2.34), P=0.0009, per 10 μm decrease]. CONCLUSION: DH history and paracentral VF defects were independently associated with wedge defects on OCTA, which was present in 45.3% of primary open-angle glaucoma patients. These findings may provide insight into glaucoma pathogenesis.",
