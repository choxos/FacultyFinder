  "title": "Classification of non-union: need for a new scoring system?",
  "abstract": "A new scoring system is proposed in order to assist surgeons with the complex analysis associated with non-union surgery. Patients with non-union are rarely easily compared with one another and this has frustrated research in this field. We have therefore attributed values to clinical features based on clinical experience and research evidence, so that patients of similar complexity can be compared with one another. When greater experience with this scoring system has been gained it will be further refined and validated. We propose that surgeons with a sub specialist interest in non-union surgery use this system in reporting results, and that non- specialist surgeons use it to inform their decision to treat the fracture themselves, or refer to a sub specialist.",
