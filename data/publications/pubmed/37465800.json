  "abstract": "We present a case report of a non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) occurring in an 89-year-old male with severe rhabdomyolysis and COVID-19 infection. The patient had a complex medical history, including non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, sinus bradycardia status post permanent pacemaker placement, and multiple comorbidities. He presented to the emergency department after a mechanical fall and was found to be COVID-19 positive. Despite the absence of typical symptoms, the patient's elevated troponin levels and electrocardiogram findings indicated NSTEMI. The initial management included an acute coronary syndrome protocol and admission to the cardiac intensive care unit. During the hospitalization, the patient developed acute hypoxic respiratory failure and was treated for COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient's renal function and creatine kinase levels showed improvement, and cardiac catheterization revealed non-obstructive coronaries. The patient was discharged in stable condition with a follow-up scheduled.",
