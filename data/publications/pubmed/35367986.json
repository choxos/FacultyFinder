  "title": "The Chronic Conditions Course: A Randomised Controlled Trial of an Internet-Delivered Transdiagnostic Psychological Intervention for People with Chronic Health Conditions.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Psychological adjustment to chronic health conditions is important, as poor adjustment predicts a range of adverse medical and psychosocial outcomes. Psychological treatments demonstrate efficacy for people with chronic health conditions, but existing research takes a disorder-specific approach and they are predominately delivered in face-to-face contexts. The internet and remotely delivered treatments have the potential to overcome barriers to accessing traditional face-to-face treatment. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined the efficacy and acceptability of an internet-delivered transdiagnostic psychological intervention to promote adjustment to illness, based on cognitive behaviour therapy principles. METHODS: In a two-arm randomised controlled trial, participants (n = 676) were randomly allocated to the 8-week intervention or a waitlist control. Treatment included five core lessons, homework tasks, additional resources, and weekly contact with a psychologist. Primary outcomes included depression, anxiety, and disability, assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment, 3-month follow-up, and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: The treatment group reported significantly greater improvements in depression (between-groups d = 0.47), anxiety (d = 0.32), and disability (d = 0.17) at post-treatment (all ps <0.001). Improvements were sustained over the 3-month and 12-month follow-ups. High treatment completion rates (69%) and levels of satisfaction (86%) were reported by participants in treatment. The intervention required a mean clinician time of 56.70 min per participant. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide preliminary and tentative support for the potential of internet-delivered transdiagnostic interventions to promote adjustment to chronic health conditions. Further research using robust control groups, and exploring the generalisability of findings, is needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.",
