  "abstract": "Aging-related diseases (ARDs) are a major global health concern, and the development of effective therapies is urgently needed. Kaempferol, a flavonoid found in several plants, has emerged as a promising candidate for ameliorating ARDs. This comprehensive review examines Kaempferol's chemical properties, safety profile, and pharmacokinetics, and highlights its potential therapeutic utility against ARDs. Kaempferol's therapeutic potential is underpinned by its distinctive chemical structure, which confers antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Kaempferol counteracts reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulates crucial cellular pathways, thereby combating oxidative stress and inflammation, hallmarks of ARDs. Kaempferol's low toxicity and wide safety margins, as demonstrated by preclinical and clinical studies, further substantiate its therapeutic potential. Compelling evidence supports Kaempferol's substantial potential in addressing ARDs through several mechanisms, notably anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic actions. Kaempferol exhibits a versatile neuroprotective effect by modulating various proinflammatory signaling pathways, including NF-kB, p38MAPK, AKT, and the Î²-catenin cascade. Additionally, it hinders the formation and aggregation of beta-amyloid protein and regulates brain-derived neurotrophic factors. In terms of its anticancer potential, kaempferol acts through diverse pathways, inducing apoptosis, arresting the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related markers, and affecting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathways. Subsequent studies should focus on refining dosage regimens, exploring innovative delivery systems, and conducting comprehensive clinical trials to translate these findings into effective therapeutic applications.",
