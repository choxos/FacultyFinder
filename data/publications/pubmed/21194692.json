  "title": "Guidelines for fracture healing assessments in clinical trials. Part II: electronic data capture and image management systems--Global Adjudicator™ system.",
  "abstract": "Adjudication of outcomes helps to reduce variation in outcome assessment when clinical judgement is used. Adjudication is extremely important when the outcome being measured is subjective, as in the assessment of fracture healing. Adjudication Committees have the potential to provide a systematic, independent, and unbiased method of determining fracture healing. In order to make the adjudication process less time consuming and more efficient, Global Research Solutions™, a Contract Research Organization which specialises in orthopaedic and surgical clinical trials, developed the Global Adjudicator™, a web-based system, to serve as both an image management system and electronic data capture system. This manuscript highlights the features of the Global Adjudicator™ and demonstrates the benefits of using a web-based adjudication system.",
