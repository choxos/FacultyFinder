  "title": "Anti-aging Natural Compounds and their Role in the Regulation of Metabolic Pathways Leading to Longevity.",
  "abstract": "Aging is an unavoidable process, leading to cell senescence due to physiochemical changes in an organism. Anti-aging remedies have always been of great interest since ancient times. The purpose of anti-aging activities is to increase the life span and the quality of life. Anti-aging activities are primarily involved in the therapies of age-related disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. These diseases are triggered by multiple factors that are involved in numerous molecular pathways including telomere shortening, NF-ÎºB pathway, adiponectin receptor pathway, insulin, and IGF signaling pathway, AMPK, mTOR, and mitochondria dysfunction. Natural products are known as effective molecules to delay the aging process through influencing metabolic pathways and thus ensure an extended lifespan. These natural compounds are being utilized in drug design and development through computational and high throughput techniques for effective pro-longevity drugs. A comprehensive study on natural compounds demonstrating their anti-aging activities along with databases of natural products for drug designing was executed and summarized in this review article.",
