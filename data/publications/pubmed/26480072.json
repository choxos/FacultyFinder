  "abstract": "The performance of a rapidly swept external cavity quantum cascade laser (ECQCL) system combined with an open-path Herriott cell was evaluated for time-resolved measurements of chemical species with broad and narrow absorption spectra. A spectral window spanning 1278 - 1390 cm(-1) was acquired at a 200 Hz acquisition rate, corresponding to a tuning rate of 2x10(4) cm(-1)/s, with a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm(-1). The capability of the ECQCL to measure < 100 ppbv changes in nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (F134A) concentrations on millisecond timescales was demonstrated in simulated plume studies with releases near the open-path Herriott cell. Absorbance spectra measured using the ECQCL system exhibited noise-equivalent absorption coefficients of 5x10(-9) cm(-1)Hz(-1/2). For a spectrum acquisition time of 5 ms, noise-equivalent concentrations (NEC) for N(2)O and F134A were measured to be 70 and 16 ppbv respectively, which improved to sub-ppbv levels with averaging to 100 s. Noise equivalent column densities of 0.64 and 0.25 ppmv Ã— m in 1 sec are estimated for N(2)O and F134A.",
