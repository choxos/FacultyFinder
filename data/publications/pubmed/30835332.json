  "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of hospitalisation and death among older adults in high-income countries. HF is often accompanied by comorbid conditions, and patients hospitalised for HF commonly die or are readmitted in the weeks follow- ing hospital discharge. The objectives of this paper are to discuss the burden of HF hospitalisations in healthcare systems and to review strategies that reduce hospitalisations and death in this condition.",
