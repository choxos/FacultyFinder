  "title": "Outcomes for a Heat Illness Prevention Program in Outdoor Workers: A 9-Year Overview.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the outcomes effect of removing the medical surveillance component from a heat illness prevention program (HIPP) for outdoor workers from a Central Texas municipality. METHODS: Heat-related illness (HRI) frequency and workers' compensation (WC) cost were assessed retrospectively in a cohort of 329 workers from 2011-2019. During 2011-2017, the HIPP included training, acclimatization, and medical surveillance. In 2018-2019, a modified (mHIPP) was implemented that included training and acclimatization, but without medical surveillance. RESULTS: The HRI rate during HIPP averaged 19.5 per 1000 workers during the first 4 years, dropped to 1.01 per 1,000 workers over the next 3 years, (2015-2017), and increased during mHIPP, to 7.6 per 1,000 workers. DISCUSSION: Although the case increase during the mHIPP was small, medical surveillance may be an important component in lowering workforce HRI.",
