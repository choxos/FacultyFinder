  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The burden of childhood obesity and cardiometabolic risk factors affecting newcomer Canadians living in lower socioeconomic circumstances is a concerning public health issue. This paper describes Strengthening Community Roots: Anchoring Newcomers in Wellness and Sustainability (SCORE!), an academic-community research partnership to co-design interventions that nurture and optimize healthy activity living (HAL) among a community of children and families new to Canada in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. METHODS/DESIGN: Our overarching program is informed by a socio-ecological model, and will co-create HAL interventions for children and families new to Canada rooted in outdoor, nature-based physical activity. We will proceed in three phases: Phase 1) synthesis of existing evidence regarding nature based HAL interventions among children and families; Phase 2) program development through four data collection activities including: i) community engagement activities to build trustful relationships and understand barriers and facilitators, including establishing a community advisory and action board, qualitative studies including a photovoice study, and co-design workshops to develop programs; ii) characterizing the demographics of the community through a household survey; iii) characterizing the built environment and HAL programs/services available in the community by developing an accessible real-time systems map; and iv) reviewing municipal policies relevant to HAL and sustainability; leading to Phase 3) implementation and evaluation of the feasibility of co-designed HAL programs. CONCLUSION: The etiology of childhood obesity and related chronic diseases is complex and multifactorial, as are intervention strategies. The SCORE! program of research brings together partners including community members, service providers, academic researchers, and organizational leaders to build a multi-component intervention that promotes the health and wellness of newcomer children and families.",
