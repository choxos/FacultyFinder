  "title": "Evaluation and Optimisation of a Patient Portal Implementation: An Action Research Approach.",
  "abstract": "Patient portals can support care delivery and have demonstrated mixed impacts on patients, clinicians and health services. These variable impacts are primarily due to barriers to uptake and challenges associated with successfully implementing patient portals. As little is currently known about how implementation barriers can be addressed in practice, this project used an action research approach to evaluate and optimise the implementation of a patient portal in a real-world setting. Whilst the study is ongoing, the preliminary findings are reported in this paper, along with plans to use the findings to improve the portal in the next round of the action research cycle.",
