  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The incidence of major gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients on low-dose direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) is relatively unknown. Estimates from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking. AIMS: To assess GIB incidence and predictors from RCT data of patients on aspirin, low-dose rivaroxaban, or both. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of RCT data wherein patients received aspirin 100 mg daily and rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.d., aspirin alone, or rivaroxaban 5 mg b.d. Patients were followed from 2013 to 2016 at 602 centres. Outcomes included overall, upper, and lower GIB. We employed multivariable logistic regression to yield odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for potential exposures. RESULTS: Among 27,395 patients, the annual incidence of GIB on rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.d. with aspirin was 801.7 per 100,000 compared with 372.3 in 100,000 for aspirin. Age (OR 4.16, 2.53-6.82 for ≥75 vs. 55-64), peptic ulcer disease (PUD, OR 1.57, 1.01-2.44), liver disease (OR 2.09, 1.01-4.33), hypertension (OR 1.42, 1.04-1.94), and smoking (OR 1.85, 1.26-2.73) were associated with overall GIB. Kidney disease (OR 1.68, 1.12-2.51) was significantly associated with upper GIB, whereas diverticular disease (OR 3.75, 1.88-7.49) was associated with lower GIB. Addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin was associated more with lower GIB (OR 2.82, 1.64-4.84) than upper GIB (OR 1.86, 1.18-2.92). CONCLUSIONS: We established incidences and identified risk factors for GIB in users of low-dose DOACs. Novel risk factors included current or former smoking and diverticulosis. Future studies should aim to validate these risk factors.",
