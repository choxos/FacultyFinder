  "abstract": "Hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma is an uncommon tumor composed of myxoid mesenchymal tissue with fluid accumulation. Here, we report a case of hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma in a 3-year-old patient who was referred to the hospital with abdominal pain and a slight fever. An abdominal ultrasound suggested a liver abscess; however, computed tomography revealed a mass with both cystic and solid components. Liver biopsy confirmed hepatic mesenchymal hamartoma, and this patient underwent the complete removal of this tumor.",
