  "title": "Exploring priority research areas in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis from dermatologists' perspective: a report from the GRAPPA 2011 annual meeting.",
  "abstract": "At the 2011 annual meeting of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) in Naples, Italy, the GRAPPA dermatology members led discussions on priority research areas in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). These discussions centered on 3 primary areas: evaluation of PsA screening tools, updates on psoriasis comorbidities, and new developments in genetics and comparative effectiveness research. Introductory presentations were followed by engaging panel discussions and audience interaction. The members agreed that screening tools are highly valuable in early detection of PsA among dermatology patients and that efforts are necessary to develop tools suitable for adoption in clinical practice. Members also agreed that a collaborative investigation to evaluate the effect of psoriasis treatments on cardiovascular comorbidities would be highly informative. Finally, the members supported continued efforts to explore the genetic basis of psoriasis and more studies focused on comparative effectiveness of existing treatments.",
