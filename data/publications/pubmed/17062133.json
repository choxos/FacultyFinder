  "title": "SnoN expression is differently regulated in microsatellite unstable compared with microsatellite stable colorectal cancers.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: SnoN is an important regulator of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) signalling pathway and has been shown to exhibit both tumour promotion and suppression activity. METHODS: To further explore the role of this complex molecule in colorectal tumorigenesis, we examined 52 paired normal and tumour colorectal specimens stratified by level of microsatellite instability; 18 with high-level microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and 34 microsatellite stable (MSS). SnoN transcript expression was quantitated by real-time PCR and analysed with respect to clinical indicators of prognosis. RESULTS: Within the MSI-H subgroup, SnoN was commonly either up-regulated (6/18, 33%) or down-regulated (7/18, 39%). A significantly different distribution of SnoN expression was observed in MSS cancers compared with MSI-H (P < or = 0.001). Whilst 17/34 (50%) of MSS tumours demonstrated up-regulation, none showed down-regulated expression. Within the MSI-H subgroup, up-regulation was significantly correlated with lack of repeat tract mutation in the TGFbetaRII gene (P < or = 0.025), suggesting that SnoN is more frequently up-regulated in the presence of functional TGFbeta signalling. CONCLUSION: Together these data support the notion that SnoN has both oncogenic and tumour suppressive properties depending on other genetic changes within the tumour, and that the MSI-H pathway of colorectal tumorigenesis presents an excellent model for the study of these opposing functions.",
