  "title": "Niraparib Maintenance Therapy for Brain Metastasis in Ovarian Endometrioid Adenocarcinoma With Peritoneal Carcinomatosis: A Comprehensive Case Study and Literature Review.",
  "abstract": "Brain metastasis is a rare complication of ovarian cancer, always found at the advanced stage. Even though different multimodal approaches are available, including surgical intervention and radiotherapy, there are no official guidelines for handling this serious complication. Poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors are a group of medications initially used for maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Niraparib has shown some efficacy in patients with brain metastasis due to its unique properties of penetrating the blood-brain barrier. Here, we present the case of a 51-year-old patient with advanced ovarian cancer with no germline breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations. Despite undergoing surgery and multiple rounds of chemotherapy, the patient's condition worsened, culminating in brain metastasis. Given her neurological issues, radiotherapy was not an option, prompting the initiation of a 300 mg dose of niraparib. To date, only sporadic case reports in the literature have described patients with ovarian cancer treated with niraparib and complicated by brain metastasis. Our case is unique because it is the first case of a patient with the endometrioid type of ovarian cancer.",
