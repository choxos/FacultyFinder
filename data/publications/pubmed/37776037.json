  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have demonstrated that pregnant and lactating people who use cannabis perceive a variety of benefits from that use, offering some explanation of why rates of use continue to increase. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore pregnant and lactating people's perceptions of the risks of cannabis use and understand what steps, if any, they take to mitigate these risks. DESIGN: Qualitative description. METHODS: We analyzed semi-structured interviews with 52 Canadians who made the decision to start, stop, or continue using cannabis during pregnancy or lactation between 2019 and 2021. Data collection iterated with analysis. We used a conventional (inductive) approach to content analysis. RESULTS: Perception of risk was found to be an essential component of decision-making about cannabis use. We identified a cycle of \"risk identification,\" \"management,\" and \"observation\" of effects. First, the pregnant or lactating person assesses the risks and weighs them against the perceived benefits of cannabis use. Second, they take action to minimize risks, with some choosing abstinence. Others, often those who were using cannabis to manage symptoms, continued cannabis use but devised a variety of other risk mitigation strategies such as, decreasing the amount or frequency of their use, changing the form of cannabis, and strategically timing their use with caregiving responsibilities. The final stage of the cycle involves seeking information about whether or not the initial perceived risk has manifested after implementing mitigation strategies, through observations and clinical information about the pregnancy or child. CONCLUSION: Participants consistently engaged in deliberation about the risks and benefits associated with their perinatal cannabis use. Nearly all implemented strategies intended to minimize risk. Our results highlight the need for more research to inform clear public health messaging about risk mitigation to minimize the potential harms of perinatal cannabis use. This work informs clinicians about patient-perceived risks and mitigation strategies which could in turn help inform shared decision-making conversations.",
