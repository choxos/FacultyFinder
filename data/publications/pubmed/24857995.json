  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization estimates that more than 15% of the global burden of road traffic trauma is in India. We performed an image-based survey of 3 major roadways in New Delhi, India, to evaluate collision-prone vehicle and pedestrian behaviors. METHODS: We used a cross-sectional survey design with photograph- and video-based data collection. The study was performed at 3 purposively sampled high traffic volume roadways in New Delhi, India. The authors reviewed preliminary photographs and came to a consensus pertaining to the definition and criteria for dangerous and collision-prone behaviors. Analysis was descriptive and was based on frequency data. RESULTS: A total of 11,214 subjects were evaluated. Eighty-six percent were vehicles (n = 9624), whereas the remaining 14% were pedestrians (n = 1572). In 99% of the frames, 1 or more predefined behavioral infraction was identified, with a total of 21% (n = 2392) of subjects committing these infractions. Specifically, 15% of all vehicles (n = 1468) and 59% of all pedestrians (n = 924) displayed a risk-taking infraction. CONCLUSIONS: Road users in New Delhi, India, engage in unacceptably high rates of collision-prone behavior. There is a need for interventions that will improve the behaviors of road users.",
