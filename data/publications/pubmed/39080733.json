  "title": "A comparison of self-reported chronic disease, health awareness and behaviours in social housing residents: cross-sectional study of communities in Ontario and Quebec.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Social housing programs are integral to making housing more affordable to Canadian seniors living in poverty. Although the programs are similar across Canada, there may be inter-provincial differences among the health of residents that could guide the development of interventions. This study explores the health of low-income seniors living in social housing in Quebec and compares it with previously reported data from Ontario. RESULTS: 80 responses were obtained in Quebec to compare with the previously reported Ontario data (n = 599) for a total of 679 responses. More Ontario residents had access to a family doctor (p < 0.001). Quebec residents experienced less problems with self-care (p = 0.017) and less mobility issues (p = 0.052). The visual analog scale for overall health state was similar in both provinces (mean = 67.36 in Ontario and 69.23 in Quebec). Residents in Quebec smoked more cigarettes per day (p = 0.009). More residents in Ontario participated in moderate physical activity (p = 0.09), however, they also spent more time per day on the computer (p = 0.006).",
