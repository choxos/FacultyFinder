  "title": "Alterations in P-glycoprotein Expression in the Placenta of Obese Rats and Humans.",
  "abstract": "Obesity affects approximately 30% of pregnancies worldwide and is one of the leading metabolic disorders among pregnant women. Maternal obesity is often associated with placental dysfunction and structural alterations, which increase the risk of developing complications. Efflux transporters, including P-glycoprotein (P-gp), may impact placental function and fetal development. Consequently, our research examined the effects of obesity on P-glycoprotein expression in both a rat model and human placental tissue. P-gp expression was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot techniques in human and rat placental tissues. Moreover, we further characterized the high-fat and high-sugar diet (HFHSD)-induced gestational obesity rat model by measuring tissue weights. Significant decreases were observed in fetal, placental, and uterus weights in the obese animals near the end of pregnancy. In obese rats, mRNA and protein expression of placental P-gp showed a reduction on gestation days 15, 20, and 22. A similar P-gp reduction was observed in the term placenta in obese women in mRNA and protein levels. We hypothesize that the reduced expression of P-gp may heighten the susceptibility of both the fetus and placenta to P-gp substrates. This alteration could potentially result in an increased risk of pregnancy complications and obesity-related drug contraindications linked to P-gp transport during pregnancy.",
