  "abstract": "Human enteric parasitoses, particularly from Cryptosporidium, were recently recognized as being highly prevalent in parts of the Arctic. This is important because cryptosporidiosis has been repeatedly associated with impaired growth and development and may synergize with other challenges faced by children in remote Arctic communities, such as overcrowding and food insecurity.",
