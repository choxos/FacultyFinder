  "title": "A Solitary Fibrous Tumor of the Eyelid.",
  "abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumor are rare and benign, soft tissue growth of any part of the human body including orbit and eyes. This case report describes a middle age female presented with a slow-growing painless mass in the superior orbital sulcus in the left eye. The lesion was surgically excised revealing the microscopic features characteristic of solitary fibrous tumor, with immunohistochemically reactivity for CD34 and STAT6 stains. Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is typically cured with complete surgical excision and CD34 immunohistochemistry proved to be a useful adjunct to the microscopic diagnosis of this type of tumor.",
