  "title": "Latent class analysis of actigraphy within the depression early warning (DEW) longitudinal clinical youth cohort.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Wearable-generated data yield objective information on physical activity and sleep variables, which, are in turn, related to the phenomenology of depression. There is a dearth of wearable-generated data regarding physical activity and sleep variables among youth with clinical depression. METHODS: Longitudinal (up to 24 months) quarterly collections of wearable-generated variables among adolescents diagnosed with current/past major depression. Latent class analysis was employed to classify participants on the basis of wearable-generated: Activity, Sleep Duration, and Sleep efficiency. The Patient Health Questionnaire adapted for adolescents (PHQ-9-A), and the Ruminative Response Scale (RRS) at study intake were employed to predict class membership. RESULTS: Seventy-two adolescents (72.5% girls) were recruited over 31 months. Activity, Sleep Duration, and Sleep efficiency were reciprocally correlated, and wearable-generated data were reducible into a finite number (3 to 4) of classes of individuals. A PHQ-A score in the clinical range (14 and above) at study intake predicted a class of low physical activity (Acceleration) and a class of shorter Sleep Duration. LIMITATIONS: Limited power related to the sample size and the interim nature of this study. CONCLUSIONS: This study of wearable-generated variables among adolescents diagnosed with clinical depression shows that a large amount of longitudinal data is amenable to reduction into a finite number of classes of individuals. Interfacing wearable-generated data with clinical measures can yield insights on the relationships between objective psychobiological measures and symptoms of adolescent depression, and may improve clinical management of depression.",
