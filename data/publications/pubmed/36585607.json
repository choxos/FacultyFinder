  "title": "Real-World Findings on the Characteristics and Treatment Exposures of Patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa from US Claims Data.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, debilitating, and painful inflammatory skin disease that significantly and negatively impacts patients' quality of life. The prevalence of HS in the USA is estimated to be 0.10%, with worldwide reports suggesting a prevalence closer to 1%. There is limited real-world evidence available on the care of patients with HS. We aimed to evaluate the trends in clinical care and treatment in the patient population with HS in the USA in a real-world setting. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted using claims data from IBM MarketScan Databases, including the US Commercial Claims and Encounters with Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits (CCAE+MDCR) database and IBM US Medicaid database. RESULTS: The annual prevalence of HS increased from 0.06% (2008) to 0.14% (2017), and from 0.17% (2008) to 0.31% (2017) among CCAE+MDCR and Medicaid patients, respectively. Dermatologist visits increased from 31.9% (2008) to 47.8% (2019) in CCAE+MDCR patients, and decreased from 10.9% (2008) to 8.5% (2018) in Medicaid patients. Opioid use decreased from 45.4% (2008) to 25.5% (2019) among CCAE+MDCR patients, and from 71.3% (2008) to 48.1% (2018) among Medicaid patients. Only 8.4% of CCAE+MDCR patients and 5.8% of Medicaid patients were exposed to any biologic in 2018. CONCLUSIONS: Improved care and treatment of HS over the last decade, including the emergence of new treatments, have been accompanied by an increase in awareness and reported prevalence of the disease. However, there are still gaps in access to dermatologic care and low utilization of biologic therapies among patients with HS. INFOGRAPHIC.",
