  "title": "Household biomass fuel use, blood pressure and carotid intima media thickness; a cross sectional study of rural dwelling women in Southern Nigeria.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rising prevalence of cardiovascular disease requires in-depth understanding of predisposing factors. Studies show an association between air pollution and CVD but this association is not well documented in southern Nigeria where the use of biomass fuels (BMF) for domestic purposes is prevalent. PURPOSE: This study aimed to explore the association between household BMF use and blood pressure (BP) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) among rural-dwelling women. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 389 women aged 18 years and older. Questionnaires were used to obtain data on predominant fuel used and a brief medical history. Wood, charcoal and agricultural waste were classified as BMF while kerosene, bottled gas and electricity were classified as non-BMF. Blood pressure and CIMT were measured using standard protocols. Regression analysis was used to assess the relationship between fuel type and BP, CIMT, pre-hypertension and hypertension after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in the mean (standard deviation) systolic BP (135.3, 26.7 mmHg vs 123.8, 22.6 mmHg; p < 0.01), diastolic BP (83.7, 18.5 mmHg vs 80.1, 13.8 mmHg; p = 0.043) and CIMT (0.63, 0.16 mm vs 0.56, 0.14 mm; p = 0.004) among BMF users compared to non-BMF users. In regression analysis, the use of BMF was significantly associated with 2.7 mmHg higher systolic BP (p = 0.040), 0.04 mm higher CIMT (p = 0.048) in addition to increased odds of pre-hypertension (OR 1.67 95% CI 1.56, 4.99, P = 0.035) but not hypertension (OR 1.23 95% CI 0.73, 2.07, P = 0.440). CONCLUSION: In this population, there was a significant association between BMF use and increased SBP, CIMT and pre-hypertension. This requires further exploration with a large-scale longitudinal study design because there are policy implications for countries like Nigeria where a large proportion of the population still rely on BMF for domestic energy.",
