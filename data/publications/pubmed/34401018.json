  "abstract": "Tuberculosis remains prevalent in developing countries. Central nervous system tuberculosis often occurs secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis, transmitted through the bloodstream, and has a high mortality rate. Meningitis is the most common presentation of central nervous system tuberculosis, followed by tuberculoma, tuberculous brain abscess, and miliary tuberculosis. In this report, we present a case of miliary tuberculosis in a 3 month-old boy. The patient had a fever and was breathless for 1 month. The patient appeared cyanotic, experienced a seizure, and became comatose. Chest computed tomography scan suggested a pulmonary miliary tuberculosis abscess in the right lung and mediastinal lymph node tuberculosis. Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed the lesions were homogeneously enhancing tiny 2-3 mm nodules characteristic of miliary TB. Polymerase chain reaction of the cerebrospinal fluid and sputum samples confirmed tuberculosis. The patient died 1 month after diagnosis.",
