  "title": "Spin coherence and electromagnetically induced transparency via exciton correlations.",
  "abstract": "We report experimental studies on exciton spin coherence induced via Coulomb correlations between excitons with opposite spins, including correlations associated with unbound as well as bound exciton pairs. Electromagnetically induced transparency resulting from the spin coherence is demonstrated in the transient optical response in GaAs quantum wells.",
