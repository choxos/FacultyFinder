  "title": "The Prevalence and Characteristics of Arrhythmic Mitral Valve Prolapse in Patients With Unexplained Cardiac Arrest.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence that mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is associated with otherwise unexplained cardiac arrest (UCA). However, reports are hindered by the absence of a systematic ascertainment of alternative diagnoses. OBJECTIVES: This study reports the prevalence and characteristics of MVP in a large cohort of patients with UCA. METHODS: Patients were enrolled following an UCA, defined as cardiac arrest with no coronary artery disease, preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, and no apparent explanation on electrocardiogram. A comprehensive evaluation was performed, and patients were diagnosed with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF) if no cause was found. Echocardiography reports were reviewed for MVP. Patients with MVP were divided into 2 groups: those with IVF (AMVP) and those with an alternative diagnosis (nonarrhythmic MVP). Patient characteristics were then compared. The long-term outcomes of AMVP were reported. RESULTS: Among 571 with an initially UCA, 34 patients had MVP (6%). The prevalence of definite MVP was significantly higher in patients with IVF than those with an alternative diagnosis (24 of 366 [6.6%] vs 5 of 205 [2.4%]; P = 0.03). Bileaflet prolapse was significantly associated with AMVP (18 of 23 [78%] vs 1 of 8 [12.5%]; P = 0.001; OR: 25.2). The proportion of patients with AMVP who received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies over a median follow-up of 42 months was 21.1% (4 of 19). CONCLUSIONS: MVP is associated with otherwise UCA (IVF), with a prevalence of 6.6%. Bileaflet prolapse appears to be a feature of AMVP, although future studies need to ascertain its independent association. A significant proportion of patients with AMVP received appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapies during follow-up.",
