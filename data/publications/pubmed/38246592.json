  "title": "Lifetime Physical Activity and Late-Life Mild Cognitive Impairment in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Regular physical activity throughout life is generally recommended to prevent dementia; however, there is little evidence regarding the association between lifetime physical activity and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which often precedes dementia. This study aimed to examine the association of lifetime physical activity and their transitions with late-life MCI. DESIGN: A population-based case-control study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2968 Japanese community-dwelling older adults aged ≥70 years without dementia. METHODS: We evaluated the participants' early-, mid-, and late-life physical activity habits and categorized their transitions across life stages. Cognitive functions in late life were assessed for memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed; functional impairment in one or more cognitive domains was defined as MCI. RESULTS: Regular physical activity in early life was not significantly associated with late-life MCI [odds ratio (OR), 0.80; 95% CI, 0.63-1.02], although those in mid-life (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.81) and late-life (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59-0.91) were associated with lower odds of late-life MCI. Compared with nonexercisers, participants who acquired new habits of physical activity during mid- or late-life (OR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.55-0.91) and those who maintained physical activity throughout their life span (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42-0.87) had lower odds of late-life MCI; those who stopped regular activity during mid- or late-life did not (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.58-1.06). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: While physical activity throughout the life span is associated with the lowest odds of MCI, starting regular physical activity, even later in life, confers a benefit and should be encouraged as a \"lifelong approach\" to MCI risk reduction.",
