  "title": "Clinical presentation of Warburg effect in aggressive lymphoma: a case report.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Warburg effect is a rare condition in tumor biology, illustrated by significant lactate production in the presence of oxygen. The Warburg effect is associated with very poor prognosis in patients with malignancy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 76-year-old Caucasian woman with double-expressor diffuse large B cell lymphoma who presented with severe lactic acidosis and extreme hypoglycemia with normal mentation. Her lactic acidosis was initially controlled with a bicarbonate infusion, and the patient was started promptly on steroids, followed by chemotherapy, but her clinical course was complicated by tumor lysis syndrome, acute renal failure requiring hemodialysis, and progressive liver failure. She manifested a temporary clinical response to chemotherapy but eventually died of complications. CONCLUSIONS: This case demonstrates the importance of prompt recognition of the Warburg effect, aggressive supportive measures, and early initiation of chemotherapy. Future studies are needed to characterize the role of hemodialysis in this setting.",
