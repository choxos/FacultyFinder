  "title": "Fixed dose combination therapies in primary cardiovascular disease prevention in different groups: an individual participant meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of fixed dose combination (FDC) medications on cardiovascular outcomes in different age groups in an individual participant meta-analysis of three primary prevention randomised trials. METHODS: Participants at intermediate risk (17.7% mean 10-year Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score), randomised to FDC of two or more antihypertensives and a statin with or without aspirin, or to their respective control, were followed up for 5 years. Age groups were <60, 60-65 and ≥65 years. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke or revascularisation. Cox proportional HRs and 95% CIs were computed within each age group. RESULTS: The primary outcome risk was reduced by 37% (3.3% in FDC vs 5.2% in control (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.74)) in the total population of 18 162 participants with larger benefits in older groups (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.78, 60 to 65 years) and (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.70, ≥65 years), as were their numbers needed to treat to avoid one primary outcome: 53 and 33, respectively. The primary outcome risk was reduced in the two oldest groups with FDC with aspirin (n=8951) by 54% and 54%, and without aspirin (n=12 061) by 34% and 38%. Dizziness, the most frequent FDC adverse effects, was higher in participants aged <65 years. Aspirin was not associated with significant bleeding excess. CONCLUSIONS: In participants with intermediate cardiovascular risk, FDCs produce larger cardiovascular benefits in older individuals, which appear greater with aspirin.
