  "title": "Development of a Toileting and Containment Decision Support Tool.",
  "abstract": "A multidisciplinary international expert panel was convened to provide input for a proposed decision support tool. This tool will assist health care professionals who are not specialized in incontinence care to assess individuals with urinary and/or fecal incontinence and recommend appropriate person-centered management options for the home care and ambulatory community settings. A targeted literature review was complemented by a series of interviews with experts in continence management, followed by a practitioner survey and rounds of expert opinion. A set of factors for assessment were defined, along with questions created to identify and quantify the factors. In addition, a range of lifestyle intervention, toileting and containment strategies were identified that were appropriate for the decision support tool. Future steps required to progress this work to a functioning tool are described.",
