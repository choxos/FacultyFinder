  "title": "Newer anticoagulants in critically ill patients.",
  "abstract": "Critically ill patients are at increased risk for development of thrombosis. In addition, thrombosis is often unrecognized in this population. Furthermore, these patients are particularly susceptible to bleeding complications from anticoagulants. Herein the authors review the pharmacology, data from clinical trials, management of bleeding complications, and perioperative use of these agents in the intensive care unit population. Well-designed clinical trials are needed to improve our understanding of the safety and efficacy of these newer agents in critically ill patients.",
