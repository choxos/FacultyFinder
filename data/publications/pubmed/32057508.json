  "abstract": "We aimed to validate the use of point-prevalence to identify catheter-associated urinary tract infections against the gold standard of incidence densities. We did not find a significant association, and hence our findings do not support the common practice of using point-prevalence as a less resource intensive method for catheter-associated urinary tract infections surveillance.",
