  "abstract": "Families of children with neurodevelopmental disorders are especially vulnerable during the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing requirements and closure of schools and services in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely challenging to everyone but may be particularly impactful for families with children with neurodevelopmental disorders ([NDDs], eg, intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD], autism spectrum disorder [ASD]). Although a small number of children may experience less stress or anxiety due to reduced social and academic expectations,[1] for many children with NDDs, and particularly those with ASD, carefully developed behavioral and environmental supports, and consistent and predictable routines and expectations, are vital for their mental well-being.[2] Consequently, abrupt discontinuation of these supports during quarantine and prolonged isolation creates a real risk for behavioral exacerbations in this vulnerable population.[3-6] Possible consequences for family members include physical and mental strain,[7] whereas for the child with an NDD, increased emotional distress and challenging behavior may create safety concerns and the need for hospitalization.[4,6] Children with NDDs may be at increased risk for COVID and COVID-related complications,[8] emphasizing the need for preventive and/or crisis behavioral health care availability outside of emergency and hospital settings.",
