  "title": "Regional differences in office and self-measured home heart rates in Asian hypertensive patients: AsiaBP@Home study.",
  "abstract": "Increased heart rate is a predictor of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all-cause mortality. In those with high heart rates, interventions for heart rate reduction have been associated with reductions in coronary events. Asia is a diverse continent, and the prevalences of hypertension and cardiovascular disease differ among its countries. The present analysis of AsiaBP@Home study data investigated differences among resting heart rates (RHRs) in 1443 hypertensive patients from three Asian regions: East Asia (N = 595), Southeast Asia (N = 680), and South Asia (N = 168). This is the first study to investigate self-measured RHR values in different Asian countries/regions using the same validated home BP monitoring device (Omron HEM-7130-AP/HEM-7131-E). Subjects in South Asia had higher RHR values compared with the other two regions, and the regional tendency found in RHR values was different from that found in BP values. Even after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, habitual alcohol consumption, current smoking habit, shift worker, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, history of heart failure, and beta-blocker use, both office and home RHR values in South Asia were the highest among Asia (mean values ± SE of office: East Asia [E] 75.2 ± 1.5 bpm, Southeast Asia [Se] 76.7 ± 1.5 bpm, South Asia [S] 81.9 ± 1.4 bpm; home morning: [E] 69.0 ± 1.2 bpm, [Se] 72.9 ± 1.2 bpm, [S] 74.9 ± 1.1 bpm; home evening: [E] 74.6 ± 1.2 bpm, [Se] 78.3 ± 1.2 bpm, [S] 83.8 ± 1.1 bpm). Given what is known about the impact of RHR on heart disease, our findings suggest the possible benefit of regionally tailored clinical strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention.",
