  "title": "Exploring the role of lncrna neat1 knockdown in regulating apoptosis across multiple cancer types: A review.",
  "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene expression, contributing significantly to a diverse range of cellular processes, including apoptosis. One such lncRNA is NEAT1, which is elevated in several types of cancer and aid in cancer growth. However, recent studies have also demonstrated that the knockdown of NEAT1 can inhibit cancer cells proliferation, movement, and infiltration while enhancing apoptosis. This article explores the function of lncRNA NEAT1 knockdown in regulating apoptosis across multiple cancer types. We explore the existing understanding of NEAT1's involvement in the progression of malignant conditions, including its structure and functions. Additionally, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which NEAT1 modulates the cell cycle, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, movement, and infiltration in diverse cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and retinoblastoma. Furthermore, we review the recent studies investigating the therapeutic potential of NEAT1 knockdown in cancer treatment. Targeting the lncRNA NEAT1 presents a promising therapeutic approach for treating cancer. It has shown the ability to suppress cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting apoptosis in various cancer types.",
