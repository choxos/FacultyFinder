  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The adverse effects of short-term exposure to PM2.5 and its components on hospital admissions for threatened and spontaneous abortions (TSAB) are still controversial. METHODS: Data on daily hospitalizations for TSAB and PM2.5 and its components, including sulfate (SO4[2-]), nitrate (NO3[-]), ammonium salt (NH4[+]), organic matter (OM), and black carbon (BC), were collected from January 2015 to December 2021 (total 2,557 days) in five cities in China. Case-crossover analyses were conducted to investigate the short-term associations between PM2.5 and its components and TSAB. Additionally, the modification effects by age (<35 and ≥35 years), season (cold and warm seasons), and the \"Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Blue Sky Defense War\" (before and after implementation) on the above associations were further conducted. RESULTS: For each 10 μg/m[3] (1 μg/m[3] for BC) increase, the strongest relative risks (95% confidence intervals) of hospitalization for TSAB were 1.011 (1.001-1.021) for PM2.5 in lag02, 1.060 (1.003-1.120) for SO4[2-] in lag02, 1.035 (1.000-1.070) for NO3[-] in lag02, 1.065 (1.009-1.124) for NH4[+] in lag02, 1.047 (1.008-1.088) for OM in lag01 and 1.029 (1.005-1.054) for BC in lag02 (all P <0.05). Furthermore, significant modifying effects of age and the Action Plan were found. The effects of NO3[-] (lag2), NH4[+] (lag2), and BC (lag2) were more pronounced in mothers aged ≥35 years and the effects of PM2.5 (lag4), NO3[-] (lag4), NH4[+] (lag4), OM (lag4), and BC (lag4) was more pronounced in the period before the Action Plan was implemented (all P modification <0.05). CONCLUSION: Short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 and its components (SO4[2-], NO3[-], NH4[+], OM, and BC) was related to increased risks of hospitalization for TSAB. The effects were more pronounced in mothers aged ≥35 years and the period before the Action Plan.",
