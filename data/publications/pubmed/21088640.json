  "title": "Patient-reported outcome measures in plastic surgery: use and interpretation in evidence-based medicine.",
  "abstract": "Understanding patients' perceptions of surgical results and their impacts on quality of life is of primary importance in plastic surgery, as procedures are largely performed to improve either appearance or function. Patient-reported outcome measures are questionnaires specifically designed to quantify aspects of health-related quality of life from the patient's perspective. This article presents an overview of patient-reported outcome measures. It also aims to provide plastic surgeons with the necessary critical appraisal skills to interpret and apply evidence from patient-reported outcomes research in their own clinical practice.",
