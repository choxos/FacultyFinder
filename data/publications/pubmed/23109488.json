  "title": "Positioning new treatments in the management of immune thrombocytopenia.",
  "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a syndrome characterized by low platelet counts and an increased risk of bleeding. For most children, ITP is a self-limiting disease; however, for some children and most adults, thrombocytopenia can become chronic. Newer therapies for ITP include rituximab and thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonists. Rituximab is a useful second-line therapy and may be splenectomy-sparing. Thrombopoeitin receptor agonists have demonstrated large treatment effects with respect to increasing platelet levels; however, they require maintenance dosing. This review summarizes how these new agents might be positioned in the management of patients with chronic ITP.",
