  "title": "Family Physicians with Certificates of Added Competence in Palliative Care Contribute to Comprehensive Care in Their Communities: A Qualitative Descriptive Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2015, the College of Family Physicians of Canada has certified enhanced skills in palliative care (PC) with a certificate of added competence. AIM: This study aimed to describe the ways family physicians with enhanced skills in PC contribute within their communities, the factors that influence ways of practicing, and the perceived impacts. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from a multiple case study on the role and impacts of family physicians with enhanced skills (i.e., PC physicians) was undertaken. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Interviews were conducted in 2018 to 2019 with PC and generalist family physicians and residents associated with six family medicine practice cases across Canada. An unconstrained qualitative content analysis was performed. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants (nine PC physicians, five generalist family physicians, two residents, and five physicians with enhanced skills in other domains) contributed data. PC physicians worked by enhancing their own family practice or as focused PC physicians. Roles included collaborating with other physicians through consultations, comanaging patients (shared care), or assuming care of the patient as the main provider (takeover). PC physicians increased capacity among their colleagues, with some patient care and education activities not being remunerated. Funding models and other structures were perceived as incentivizing the takeover model. CONCLUSION: Family physicians with enhanced skills in PC contribute to comprehensive care through the end of life. Remuneration should support system capacity and relationships that enable family physicians to provide primary PC especially outside the takeover model.",
