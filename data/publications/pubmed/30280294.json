  "title": "Reverse Engineering the 1-Month Lupron Depot®.",
  "abstract": "The 1-month Lupron Depot® (LD) encapsulating water-soluble leuprolide in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres is a benchmark product upon which modern long-acting release products are often compared. Despite expiration of patent coverage, no generic product for the LD has been approved in the USA, likely due to the complexity of components and manufacturing processes involved in the product. Here, we describe the reverse engineering of the LD composition and important product attributes. Specific attributes analyzed for microspheres were as follows: leuprolide content by three methods; gelatin content, type, and molecular weight distribution; PLGA content, lactic acid/glycolic acid ratio, and molecular weight distribution; mannitol content; in vitro drug release; residual solvent and moisture content; particle size distribution and morphology; and glass transition temperature. For the diluent, composition, viscosity, and specific gravity were analyzed. Analyzed contents of the formulation and the determined PLGA characteristics matched well with the official numbers stated in the package insert and those found in literature, respectively. The gelatin was identified as type B consistent with ~ 300 bloom. The 11-μm volume-median microspheres in the LD slowly released the drug in vitro in a zero-order manner after ~ 23% initial burst release. Very low content of residual moisture (< 0.5%) and methylene chloride (< 1 ppm) in the product indicates in-water drying is capable of removing solvents to extremely low levels during manufacturing. The rigorous approach of reverse engineering described here may be useful for development of generic leuprolide-PLGA microspheres as well as other new and generic PLGA microsphere formulations.",
