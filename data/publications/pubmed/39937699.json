  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Healthcare workers (HCWs) have reported COVID-19 pandemic-related adverse mental health impacts. We examined the demographic profile of HCWs who self-referred for mental health treatment, how referrals changed over time in relation to waves of COVID-19, what the main problem was for which HCWs sought treatment, and how this changed during the pandemic. METHODS: Five major healthcare institutions provided mental health supports to HCWs across Ontario during the pandemic. Data from May 2020 to March 2022 were collected from 2725 HCW self-referrals regarding referral frequency, main presenting mental health problem and demographic information including ethnicity, gender, age, healthcare setting, profession and whether the HCW had a prior mental health diagnosis or had received prior mental health treatment. RESULTS: Treatment-seeking HCWs who self-referred predominantly self-identified as female and White. Almost half were nurses, and almost half had received previous mental health treatment; a slightly higher percentage reported a prior mental health diagnosis. Over 60% of the overall sample of HCWs worked in hospitals. The timing of increases and decreases in monthly new referrals roughly aligned with the onset and ending, respectively, of COVID-19 waves. The top five most common presenting problems for treatment-seeking were generalized anxiety/worry symptoms, depression, situational crisis/acute stress response, difficulty with stress/occupational or financial, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. CONCLUSION: Ontario HCWs self-referred to access mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority sought treatment for generalized anxiety/worry or depression symptoms. Results of this study may inform system planning for future pandemics, as well as for HCW wellness programs for continued workplace stress in the postpandemic period.",
