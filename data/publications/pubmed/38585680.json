  "title": "\"Comfort of Sitting at Home While Getting Information I Needed\": Experiences of Cardiac Patients Attending Virtual Cardiac Rehabilitation.",
  "abstract": "Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, several health care services, including cardiac rehabilitation (CR), had to transition to virtual delivery, for which formal evaluations are lacking. In this pilot study, we investigated the implementation of a virtual CR program by surveying 30 patients attending virtual CR. Virtual CR was well received, although patients provided recommendations to improve delivery such as offering individual sessions and changing how education materials were delivered. Virtual delivery of CR likely has a role in health care, either independently or as part of a hybrid model; however, further evaluation is required.",
