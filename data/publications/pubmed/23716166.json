  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder highlighted by progressive declines in cognition and function. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this article is to assess whether persons with AD would support out-of-pocket payment for an AD medication; to elicit the monthly dollar amounts they would pay. METHODS: We recruited persons with mild or moderate AD (n = 216) from nine clinics across Canada. During one-on-one interviews, we presented our sample with four scenarios describing a medication that either treated disease symptoms or modified the course of AD; each version of the medication was alternatively presented as having a 0 % or 30 % chance of adverse effects. For each scenario, participants indicated whether they would support paying out-of-pocket for the medication (yes/no). Affirmative responses were followed with questions asking participants whether they would pay $75, $150, or $225 (Canadian dollars) per month. RESULTS: Levels of support ('yes' responses) ranged from 57 % to 83 % and mean willingness-to-pay ranged from $98 to $137, depending on scenario. Participants were more likely to provide affirmative responses and higher willingness-to-pay amounts when the medication modified disease or had a 0 % chance of adverse effects. Age was inversely associated with support in three scenarios and willingness-to-pay amounts in all four scenarios. Positive associations between post-secondary education and willingness-to-pay amounts were found in three scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with mild or moderate AD were often willing to pay out-of-pocket for AD medications. However, the mean maximum willingness-to-pay ($137) for the optimal medication scenario was lower than the average monthly cost of existing AD medications.",
