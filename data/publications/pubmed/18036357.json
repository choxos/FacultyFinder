  "title": "Effect of modified glucose-insulin-potassium on free fatty acids, matrix metalloproteinase, and myoglobin in ST-elevation myocardial infarction.",
  "abstract": "Insulin has a free fatty acid (FFA)-suppressive effect, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)- and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-lowering effect, and a potential myocardial-protective effect. Whether low-dose insulin exerts these effects in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) was investigated. Thirty-two patients administered thrombolytics and heparin were randomly assigned to a modified glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) regimen (insulin 2.5 U/hour, dextrose and potassium titrated to prevent hyperglycemia) or normal saline solution and potassium (controls) for 48 hours. Plasma FFA, serum VEGF, pro-MMP-1, and myoglobin were measured at baseline and sequentially for 48 hours. FFA concentrations were increased at baseline; increased further in the first 4 hours in controls (p<or=0.008), but not in the GIK group, and were higher at 4 hours in controls compared with the GIK group (p=0.0009). VEGF decreased to 7% of baseline at 2 hours and remained suppressed in both groups (p=0.0008). Pro-MMP-1 decreased in both groups (p<0.005), but this decrease was seen earlier at 2 hours in the GIK group compared with 4 hours in controls. There was no significant increase in myoglobin at 2 hours in the GIK group, whereas there was a significant increase in controls. Mean blood glucose was 131 mg/dl in controls and 124 mg/dl in the GIK group (p=NS). In conclusion, this modified GIK regimen attenuated the increase in FFA, but did not suppress it to less than the threshold for myocardial FFA uptake. It suppressed pro-MMP-1 rapidly and decreased myoglobin, whereas heparin suppressed VEGF in patients with acute MI. This provided additional rationale for conducting a trial to assess the clinical benefits of this modified GIK regimen in patients with acute MI.",
