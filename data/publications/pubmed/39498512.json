  "title": "An Efficient Bifunctional Core-Shell ZIF-90@ZIF-67 Composite as a Stable Pickering Interfacial Catalyst for the Deacetalization-Knoevenagel Tandem Reaction.",
  "abstract": "Exploiting advanced solid particles is crucial to the construction of Pickering emulsions catalysis. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been used as ideal emulsifiers stabilizing Pickering emulsions for interfacial catalysis. Although Pickering emulsions stabilized by core-shell MOFs have significant importance in practical studies, to date there have been very limited reports on this topic. Herein, ZIF-90@ZIF-67, a core-shell material with simultaneous acid-base bifunctionality, was synthesized by seeded epitaxial growth. It was firstly applied as an emulsifier in Pickering emulsions to catalyze the deacetalization-Knoevenagel tandem reaction, which exhibited excellent catalytic properties and achieved extremely high yields. Additionally, ZIF-90@ZIF-67 showed high stability and remained well repeatable after five cycles. This work provides a platform for the design of structurally and functionally diverse MOF-based Pickering emulsions interfacial catalysis.",
