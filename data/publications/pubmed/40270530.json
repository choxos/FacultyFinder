  "title": "Wastewater-Based Surveillance of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Reveals a Temporal Disconnect in Disease Trajectory across an Active International Land Border.",
  "abstract": "Conventional metrics for tracking infectious diseases, including case and outbreak data and syndromic surveillance, can be resource-intensive, misleading, and comparatively slow with prolonged data collection, analysis and authentication. This study examined the 2022-2023 Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) season in a contiguous metropolitan area connected by an active international land border, affording an opportunity for comparison of the respiratory virus season spanning two independent public health jurisdictions. Time-lagged cross correlation and qualitative examination of the wastewater signals showed that the peak of the Detroit (MI, USA) RSV season predated the peak in Windsor (ON, Canada) by approximately 5 weeks. A strong positive relationship was observed between RSV N-gene concentrations in wastewater and hospitalization rates in Windsor-Essex (Kendall's τ = 0.539, p ≤ 0.001, Spearman's ρ = 0.713, p ≤ 0.001) as well as Detroit (Kendall's τ = 0.739, p ≤ 0.001, Spearman's ρ = 0.888, p ≤ 0.001). This study demonstrated that wastewater surveillance can reveal regional differences in infection dynamics between communities and can provide an independent measure of the prevalence of RSV, an underreported disease. These findings support the use of wastewater surveillance as a cost-effective tool in monitoring of RSV to enhance existing surveillance systems and to better inform public health disease mitigation strategies.",
