  "abstract": "Chest pain is a symptom that is potentially life-threatening and requires quick and accurate evaluations. This article describes the quality of guidelines related to the evaluation and diagnosis of acute, undifferentiated chest pain. After systematically evaluating existing guidelines, we found that there exists a wide variety of quality in these documents. Future documents that provide recommendations should utilize guideline evaluation tools during the creation process to ensure a high-quality product, regardless of document type.",
