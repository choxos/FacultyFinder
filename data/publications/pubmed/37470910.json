  "abstract": "Partial nephrectomy (PN) is an alternative to radical nephrectomy (RN) in the appropriate localized renal tumor. The scope of PN has expanded over time and, since the advent and proliferation of minimally invasive surgery, more surgeons have access to and have been trained in laparoscopic and robotic technology. Amid the changing surgical landscape, we sought to characterize the trends in management by cancer stage, institution type, and geographic location using the National Cancer Database (NCDB). We queried the NCDB for patients with kidney cancer from 2004 to 2019. Overall, 241,311 patients who underwent PN or RN were included in the study. The nephrectomy approach was categorized as robotic partial (RPN), robotic radical (RRN), laparoscopic partial (LPN), laparoscopic radical (LRN), open or unspecified partial (OPN), and open or unspecified radical (ORN). The categorical variables were presented as frequency and percentages. Overall, there was an increase in the utilization of robotic approaches from 2010 to 2019. For cT1 tumors, the use of RPN and RRN increased from 14.27 to 33.06% and 5.24% to 19.63%, respectively. The use of ORN for cT2 and cT3 tumors declined, with rates dropping from 54.71 to 10.76% and 64.71 to 46.64%, respectively. Conversely, the utilization of RRN rose during this period. However, ORN remained the most common approach for cT3 tumors. The use of RPN increased across different facility types, with the highest utilization observed in academic/research programs. The use of ORN for cT2 and cT3 tumors declined across facility types, although it remained most prevalent in community cancer programs. The use of robot-assisted surgery to treat localized renal cancer increased in the US between 2010 and 2019 across all stages of disease. RPN became the most used approach for cT1 disease, while LRN was preferred for cT2 disease. ORN remained the approach of choice for cT3 disease throughout the study period. Trends in facility type and geographic location largely mirrored the overall trends.",
