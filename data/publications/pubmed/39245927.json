  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) is the most commonly affected internal organ in systemic sclerosis (SSc). We sought to determine the prevalence and impact of GIT symptoms on survival and patient-reported outcomes. METHODS: A total of 907 consecutive patients from the Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study who had prospectively completed the University of California, Los Angeles, Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Gastrointestinal Tract 2.0 Questionnaire (UCLA GIT) between 2015 and 2021 were included. The associations between UCLA GIT scores and physical function (Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire), quality of life (QoL; Short Form 36), mood (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [PROMIS] anxiety and depression domains), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue score), and employment were investigated using multivariable population-averaged panel models using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate survival according to total UCLA GIT scores. RESULTS: GIT symptoms were reported in 87% of participants, with 46% to 52% reporting moderate to very severe symptoms of reflux, distension, diarrhea, and constipation. Higher total UCLA GIT scores were associated with worse QoL, physical function, fatigue, anxiety, and depression (P < 0.001). In the multivariable GEE analysis, moderate and severe to very severe total scores, reflux scores, and distension scores were associated with worse physical function, QoL, fatigue, anxiety, and depression compared to mild scores (P < 0.05). Patients with severe total scores and diarrhea scores were more likely to be unemployed compared to those with mild scores (P < 0.05). UCLA GIT total scores were not independently associated with death in our cohort. CONCLUSION: GIT manifestations are common in SSc and negatively impact QoL, physical function, and employment but are not directly associated with increased death.",
