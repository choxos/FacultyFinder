  "title": "Spatial neophobia is still not correlated with object neophobia in wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus).",
  "abstract": "Neophobia, aversive behaviour towards novel objects, foods and environments, is a trait that affects the ability of animals to adapt to new environments and exploit novel resources. Our previous work demonstrated that individual responses of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to object neophobia trials were not correlated with time spent in or latency to enter a novel environment. However, because no positive stimulus was present in the novel environment, this study may have measured spatial neophilia. In the present study, we placed familiar food dishes in a novel environment and assessed whether an individual's willingness to enter and feed was significantly correlated with its willingness to feed from a familiar dish containing a novel object in the home cage. We exposed house sparrows (n = 26) to a novel environment and measured their latency to enter and feed, total time spent in the novel environment and total feeding time. Sparrows were also assessed for object neophobia in their home cage. Results indicated that there were no correlations between any of the measured behaviours in the novel environment and individual responses to novel object trials, suggesting that even with food as a common motivator, spatial neophobia and object neophobia represent two distinct traits.",
