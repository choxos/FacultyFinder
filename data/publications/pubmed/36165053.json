  "title": "Pilot study of an elimination diet in adults with mild to moderate Crohn's disease.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There remains limited data supporting the efficacy of dietary therapy in adults with Crohn's disease (CD). This was a pilot study of the McMaster Elimination diet for CD (MED-CD), which excludes several potentially detrimental ingredients commonly found in the Western diet. METHODS: Prospective study in adults with mild-moderately active CD [Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI) scores 5-16] and endoscopic disease activity of >7 (or ≥4 for isolated ileal disease) as measured by the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). Patients were treated for 2 weeks using oral enteral nutrition (EN). Those with symptomatic improvement (HBI score reduction ≥2) were transitioned to the MED-CD for 12 weeks. Outcomes of interest included satisfactory adherence (≥20 on the modified medical adherence report scale-5 questionnaire), clinical remission (CR) (HBI ≤4), clinical response (HBI reduction ≥3), endoscopic response (SES-CD reduction ≥50%), and endoscopic remission (ER) (SES-CD <3). RESULTS: A total of 17 patients were treated with 2 weeks of EN. Of these, 13 were deemed responders and treated with 12 weeks of MED-CD. Satisfactory adherence was reported among 11/13 (84.6%) at week 6 and 8/12 (67%) at week 14. Of the 13 patients who responded to EN by week 2, 5 (38.5%) had attained CR at week 2 and maintained CR until week 14 using MED-CD. Endoscopic response was observed in 6 (46.2%) participants and ER was seen in 2 (15.4%). CONCLUSIONS: Two weeks of oral EN followed by 12 weeks of the MED-CD was acceptable by most adult patients who enroled in this study.",
