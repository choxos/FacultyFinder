  "title": "Exploring acemannan-loaded nanogel formulation for the treatment of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like inflammation: In vitro characterization and in vivo efficacy assessment.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to explore a nanogel formulation containing acemannan as a carrier for the treatment of psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Several acemannan concentrations, such as F1 (2.5 %) and F2 (5 %), were used to prepare the nanogel formulation by homogenization. The formulation was then assessed for in-vitro performance. Four groups of animals were randomly assigned to the animals: Cluster I consisted of normal saline control; Cluster II was assigned Imiquimod (IMQ) control (5 %); Cluster III was assigned IMQ + 2.5 % acemannan (F1); and Cluster IV was assigned IMQ + 5 % acemannan (F2). The effectiveness of the gel in the in vivo study was evaluated in terms of body weight, scaly skin, skin redness, inflammation, patches, moisturizing effect, pro-inflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide, and histopathological examination. The prepared nanogel possessed the desired characteristics in terms of in vitro evaluation parameters. The average particle size was around 199.6 nm, with a polydispersibility index (PDI) of 0.338 and a zeta potential of -65.9 mV. The nanogel formulation significantly (P < 0.05) regulated in vivo performance, including redness, scaly skin, inflammation, patches, moisturizing effect, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide. The histopathological findings suggested that acemannan was effective in rejuvenating the affected skin.",
