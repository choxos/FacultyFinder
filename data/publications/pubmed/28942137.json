  "abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lantana camara is a popular invasive weed utilized in the management of ulcer in different part of world. Study of specific compound present in this plant responsible for their antulcer activity is main topic of concern. Current study designed for evaluation of the antiulcer activity of oleane-12-en-3β-ol-28-oic acid 3β-D-glucopyranoside (OAG) from Lantana camara L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiulcer activity was carried out on NSAID's (Aspirin) and ethanol induced ulcer model. The efficacy of the OAG on ulcer index, percentage protection and gastric acid secretion were evaluated. RESULTS: Ulcer protection percentage (38.37%) was significant (P < 0.001) higher in the groups treated with the higher OAG dose (50mg/kg), it also recover the mucosa with no redness, no inflammation, mild dilation of blood vessels. OAG significantly (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001) reduce acidity, free acidity and gastric acid volume. It also significantly (P < 0.01) increases the pH of stomach. CONCLUSION: On the basis of results, it can be concluded that OAG shows significant gastroprotective activity by gastric acid secretion inhibition and afford protection against gastric mucosal damage. Further increase of prostaglandin E2 level establishes the mechanism of antiulcer activity of OAG.",
