  "title": "Development of simple clinical criteria for the definition of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis: a report from the GRAPPA 2012 annual meeting.",
  "abstract": "Dermatologist and primary care clinicians are in an ideal position to identify the emergence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in patients with psoriasis. Yet these clinicians are not well trained to distinguish inflammatory musculoskeletal disease from other more common problems such as osteoarthritis, traumatic or degenerative tendonitis and back pain, or fibromyalgia. A simple set of clinical criteria to identify inflammatory disease would aid recognition of PsA. At its 2012 annual meeting, the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) discussed development of evidence-based, practical, and reliable definitions of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis. This project will be a sequential process of expert clinician nominal-group technique, patient surveys and focus groups, and Delphi exercises to identify core features of inflammatory disease, testing these in a small group of patients with and without inflammatory disease, and finally validating these criteria in larger groups of patients.",
