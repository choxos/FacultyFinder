  "abstract": "Formaldehyde (FA) is endogenously generated via fundamental biological processes in living systems. Aberrant FA homeostasis in subcellular microenvironments is implicated in numerous pathological conditions. Fluorescent probes for detecting FA in specific organelles are thus of great research interest. Herein, we present a modular strategy to construct diverse organelle-targeting FA probes by incorporating selective organelle-targeting moieties into the scaffold of a 1,8-naphthalimide-derived FA fluorescent probe. These probes react with FA through the 2-aza-Cope arrangement and exhibit highly selective fluorescence increases for detecting FA in aqueous solutions. Moreover, these organelle-targeting probes, i.e., FFP551-Nuc, FFP551-ER, FFP551-Mito, and FFP551-Lyso, allow selective localization and imaging of FA in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, and lysosomes of live mammalian cells, respectively. Furthermore, FFP551-Nuc has been successfully employed to monitor changes of endogenous FA levels in the nucleus of live mammalian cells. Overall, these probes should represent new imaging tools for studying the biology and pathology associated with FA in different intracellular compartments.",
