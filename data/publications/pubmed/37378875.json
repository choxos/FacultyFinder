  "title": "Disease Burden and Treatment Patterns Among US Patients with Hidradenitis Suppurativa: A Retrospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, autoinflammatory skin disease associated with many comorbidities. One biologic (adalimumab) is approved for HS. This study assessed the sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, treatment patterns, healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and associated costs of patients with HS following biologic approval. METHODS: This non-interventional, retrospective cohort study involved adult (≥ 18 years) and adolescent (12-17 years) patients diagnosed with HS in the United States (US) using Optum's de-identified Clinformatics[®] Data Mart Database during the period 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. RESULTS: Of 42,843 identified patients, 10,909 met the incident HS patient criteria (10,230 adults, 628 adolescents, 51 patients aged <12 years). Patients were mostly diagnosed by a general practitioner/pediatrician (adults: 41.6%; adolescents: 39.6%) or dermatologist (adults: 22.1%; adolescents: 30.6%). Commonly reported Charlson comorbidities at pre-index in adult patients were diabetes without complications (20.4%), chronic pulmonary disease (16.4%) and diabetes with complications (9.0%), and the most frequent Elixhauser comorbidities were uncomplicated hypertension (38.3%), obesity (22.5%), uncomplicated diabetes (19.0%) and depression (17.4%). The burden of comorbidities generally increased over time after diagnosis in both adults and adolescents. HS-related surgical procedures were uncommon in the 2-years post-index period: an incision and drainage procedure was reported in 7.6% of adults and 6.4% of adolescents. Patients were predominantly treated with both topical and systemic antibiotic treatments (adults: 25.0% and 65.1%, respectively; adolescents: 41.7% and 74.5%, respectively). Biologic prescription was higher in adults than adolescents (3.5% vs. 1.8%). Total healthcare costs for adult and adolescent patients in the 2-years post-index period were US$42,143 and US$16,057, respectively, with outpatient costs accounting for the majority of these costs (US$20,980 and US$8408, respectively). CONCLUSION: In adult and adolescent patients with HS, comorbidity burden continues to increase after diagnosis. All-cause and HS-specific HCRU and costs are high in adults and adolescents with HS. These findings support the need for a multidisciplinary comprehensive care strategy for patients with HS.",
