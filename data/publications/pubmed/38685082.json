  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are among the leading chronic diseases worldwide. Environmental phenols have been renowned as endocrine disruptors that contribute to weight changes; however, the effects of exposure to mixed phenols on obesity are not well established. METHODS: Using data from adults in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this study examined the individual and combined effects of four phenols on obesity. A combination of traditional logistic regression and two mixed models (weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression and Bayesian kernel-machine regression (BKMR)) were used together to assess the role of phenols in the development of obesity. The potential mediation of cholesterol on these effects was analyzed through a parallel mediation model. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that solitary phenols except triclosan were inversely associated with obesity (P-value < 0.05). The WQS index was also negatively correlated with general obesity (β: 0.770, 95% CI: 0.644-0.919, P-value = 0.004) and abdominal obesity (β: 0.781, 95% CI: 0.658-0.928, P-value = 0.004). Consistently, the BKMR model demonstrated the significant joint negative effects of phenols on obesity. The parallel mediation analysis revealed that high-density lipoprotein mediated the effects of all four single phenols on obesity, whereas low-density lipoprotein only mediated the association between benzophenol-3 and obesity. Moreover, Cholesterol acts as a mediator of the association between mixed phenols and obesity. Exposure to single and mixed phenols significantly and negatively correlated with obesity. Cholesterol mediated the association of single and mixed environmental phenols with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Assessing the potential public health risks of mixed phenols helps to incorporate this information into practical health advice and guidance.",
