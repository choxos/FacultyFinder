  "title": "Valgus high tibial osteotomy. Comparison between an Ilizarov and a Coventry wedge technique for the treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee.",
  "abstract": "A matched-pair comparative analysis was done comparing outcomes between a Coventry-type closing wedge valgus high tibial osteotomy (HTO) and an HTO using an Ilizarov apparatus. Thirty patients were treated with a mean follow-up interval of 28.1 months. Functional outcomes were evaluated using the Western Ontario and McMaster University (WOMAC) osteoarthritis index. Clinical and radiographic assessment of the index knee, complications, and over-all satisfaction of the patients were assessed. The procedures were performed between 1994 and 1997. The two groups were equal with respect to baseline demographics - age, sex, body mass index, smoking status. The patients undergoing an Ilizarov HTO had a significantly greater decrease in pain and increase in function at final follow-up assessment. Eleven of the 15 patients in the Ilizarov group were satisfied with the procedure compared to five in the closing wedge HTO group. The treatment of medial compartment osteoarthritis in genu varum of the knee with an Ilizarov apparatus produces outcomes that are comparable to the standard lateral closing wedge osteotomy.",
