  "abstract": "Evidence for the value of peer support for eating disorders (EDs) is growing. Peer support is not a replacement for treatment, but can provide hope for recovery, enhance motivation for treatment, and increase feelings of connectedness and belonging for those experiencing EDs. In this study, we explored peer mentees' experiences of peer support for EDs to better understand the impact of peer support and its role in the Canadian treatment and support continuum. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 people who had received peer support (group, one-on-one, or chat) and conducted a reflexive thematic analysis through a critical realist lens. We developed four themes. Participants described the importance of connecting with others who had \"been there,\" which helped generate a sense of belonging and connectedness. They also highlighted aspects of the peer support \"container\" that needed to be in place, such as guidelines for groups and agreements for one-on-one mentoring. When peer support was delivered well, participants described how it helped them help themselves through increasing motivation, communication skills, and other coping skills. Finally, participants described the unique role of peer support within the treatment continuum, as a modality that was accessible, free, and delivered in a way that focused on the whole person. Together, our findings illustrate the value of peer support and considerations for enabling effective and safe peer support delivery.",
