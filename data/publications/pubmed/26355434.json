  "abstract": "Bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) are now believed to be the progenitors in the development of gastric cancer in patients with chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori. However, the mechanism of recruitment and malignant transformation of these cells has not been completely understood. Here I will discuss selected findings on how BMSCs compromise local immunity and skip local defense mechanisms in order to undergo malignant transformation. In addition, the role of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 through binding to its ligand stromal-derived factor in migration of BMSCs in mouse model of gastric cancer will be looked at. These findings are important in understanding the pathogenesis of H. pylori-associated gastric cancer and to develop new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities.",
