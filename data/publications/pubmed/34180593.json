  "abstract": "The gut microbiome composition is influenced by many factors including environmental exposures. Here, we investigated the effect of thirdhand cigarette smoke (THS) and exposure age on gut microbiome diversity. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to THS at human exposure relevant levels for three weeks during three different life stages: postnatal (0-3 weeks of age), pubescent (4-7 weeks of age), and adult (9-12 weeks of age), respectively. Cecal microbiome profiles were assessed at 17 weeks of age by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that age at THS exposure strongly influenced the cecal microbiome composition. Although postnatal THS exposure significantly influenced the microbial composition, pubescent and adulthood exposures only had minor effects. The microbiome of postnatally THS-exposed mice significantly increased several degradation pathways that regulate glycolysis and pyruvate decarboxylation, and significantly decreased coenzyme A biosynthesis and pyrimidine deoxyribonucleoside salvage. Our results indicate that mouse postnatal development is particularly susceptible to persistent THS exposure effects on the gut microbiome.",
