  "title": "Telehealth coaching to improve self-management for secondary prevention after stroke: A randomized controlled trial of Stroke Coach.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke Coach is a lifestyle coaching telehealth program to improve self-management of stroke risk factors. AIMS: To examine the efficacy of Stroke Coach on lifestyle behavior and risk factor control among community-living stroke survivors within one-year post stroke. METHODS: Participants were randomized to Stroke Coach or an attention control Memory Training group. Lifestyle behavior was measured using the Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II. Secondary outcomes included specific behavioral and cardiometabolic risk factors, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), cognitive status, and depressive symptoms. Measurements were taken at baseline, post-intervention (6 months), and retention (12 month). Linear mixed-effects models were used to test the study hypotheses (p < 0.05). All analyses were intention-to-treat. RESULTS: The mean age of the Stroke Coach (n = 64) and Memory Training (n = 62) groups was 67.2 and 69.1 years, respectively. The majority of participants (n = 100) had mild stroke (modified Rankin Scale = 1 or 2), were active, with controlled blood pressure (mean = 129/79 mmHg) at baseline. At post-intervention, there were no significant differences in lifestyle (b = -2.87; 95%CI - 8.03 to 2.29; p = 0.28). Glucose control, as measured by HbA1c (b = 0.17; 95%CI 0.17 to 0.32; p = 0.03), and HRQoL, measured using SF-36 Physical Component Summary (b = -3.05; 95%CI -5.88 to -0.21; p = 0.04), were significantly improved in Stroke Coach compared to Memory Training, and the improvements were maintained at retention. CONCLUSION: Stroke Coach did not improve lifestyle behavior; however, there were improvements to HbA1c and HRQoL among community-living stroke survivors with mild stroke-related disability.
