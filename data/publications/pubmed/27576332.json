  "title": "Radiographic outcomes reporting after arthroscopic management of femoroaceabular impingement: a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is a condition increasingly being recognized as a cause of hip pain and disability. Hip arthroscopy is a common method used to treat this condition. The purpose of this review was to identify reported radiographic outcomes after arthroscopic surgery for FAI. Online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and Medline) were screened for studies involving arthroscopic management of FAI. Full-text reviews of eligible studies were conducted. We identified 23 eligible studies involving 1348 patients from an initial screen of 1304 studies involved. There were 15 different radiographic parameters among the 23 studies. The most commonly reported radiographic outcomes included the alpha angle (69.6 %), center edge angle (34.7 %), and femoral offset ratio (17.4 %). This study highlights the significant variation in reported radiographic outcomes after arthroscopic FAI surgery.",
