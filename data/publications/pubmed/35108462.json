  "title": "Variation determinants within massage therapists' professional identity.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Individuals have multiple, competing identities that vary in importance to the self. Professional identity is a way in which individuals attribute meaning to their contribution to society and is influenced by complex factors. Globally, the roles and responsibilities of massage therapists (MTs) vary, making it challenging to articulate a cohesive professional identity. This article describes the investigation into the variables which influenced response regarding MTs' professional identity in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: An online questionnaire was distributed to active MTs with available email addresses in the public register of the College of Massage Therapists of Ontario. Chi-square tests of independence were used to compare dependent variables with independent variables. Significance was adjusted post hoc, using Bonferroni's correction, to reduce the chance of a type I error occurring. The threshold for significance was adjusted from p≤0.05 to p≤0.01 as multiple analyses were conducted with a high response rate. RESULTS: The results provided insight into the variables associated with differences in responses. Variation was seen based on gender, primary practice setting, length in practice, additional education, additional roles within the profession, additional designation as a healthcare provider, and membership in the RMTAO (Registered Massage Therapists' Association of Ontario). CONCLUSIONS: While previous studies sought to describe the common and unifying features of MTs' identity, these findings provide insight into variables that determine differences in responses. These findings are valuable for the development of future studies. They provide a priori assumptions regarding the inclusion of these demographic items that can inform decisions regarding enrollment of the sample and data analysis.",
