  "title": "Rivaroxaban and Aspirin in Peripheral Vascular Disease: a Review of Implementation Strategies and Management of Common Clinical Scenarios.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects an estimated 200 million people worldwide and is associated with significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cardiovascular risk is further increased among individuals with polyvascular disease, where either cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease is present in addition to PAD. In this review, we present common clinical scenarios encountered when managing patients with PAD and provide an evidence-based approach to prescribing optimal antithrombotics in this population. RECENT FINDINGS: The COMPASS trial recently demonstrated that rivaroxaban 2.5Â mg BID + ASA daily significantly reduces major adverse cardiac and limb events in patients with PAD. Despite these advances, morbidity following MALE events remains high. With widespread approval by federal health regulators, the COMPASS regimen should be strongly considered in PAD patients who do not have a high bleeding risk. Implementing the COMPASS regimen in patients with PAD, along with other vascular risk reduction strategies, will have a substantial impact on reducing atherothromboembolic risk in patients with established vascular disease.",
