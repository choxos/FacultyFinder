  "title": "From oncogenes to tumor suppressors: The dual role of ncRNAs in fibrosarcoma.",
  "abstract": "Fibrosarcoma is a challenging cancer originating from fibrous tissues, marked by aggressive growth and limited treatment options. The discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), has opened new pathways for understanding and treating this malignancy. These ncRNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation, cellular processes, and the tumor microenvironment. This review aims to explore the impact of ncRNAs on fibrosarcoma's pathogenesis, progression, and resistance to treatment, focusing on their mechanistic roles and therapeutic potential. A comprehensive review of literature from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar was conducted, focusing on the dysregulation of ncRNAs in fibrosarcoma, their contribution to tumor growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and their cellular pathway interactions. NcRNAs significantly influence fibrosarcoma, affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis. Their function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors makes them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Understanding their interaction with the tumor microenvironment is essential for developing more effective treatments for fibrosarcoma. Targeting ncRNAs emerges as a promising strategy for fibrosarcoma therapy, offering hope to overcome the shortcomings of existing treatments. Further investigation is needed to clarify specific ncRNAs' roles in fibrosarcoma and to develop ncRNA-based therapies, highlighting the significance of ncRNAs in improving patient outcomes in this challenging cancer.",
