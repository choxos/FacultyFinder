  "title": "Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Expression Predicts Need for Early Treatment in Prostate Cancer Patients Managed with Active Surveillance.",
  "abstract": "Metabolic dysregulation is an early event in carcinogenesis. Here, we examined the expression of enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis (ATP-citrate lyase: ACLY), glucose uptake (Glucose Transporter 1: GLUT1), and folate-glutamate metabolism (Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen: PSMA) as potential biomarkers of risk for early prostate cancer progression. Patients who were managed initially on active surveillance with a Gleason score of 6 or a low-volume Gleason score of 7 (3 + 4) were accrued from a prostate cancer diagnostic assessment program. Patients were asked to donate their baseline diagnostic biopsy tissues and permit access to their clinical data. PSMA, GLUT1, and ACLY expression were examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC) in baseline biopsies, quantitated by Histologic Score for expression in benign and malignant glands, and compared with patient time remaining on active surveillance (time-on-AS). All three markers showed trends for elevated expression in malignant compared to benign glands, which was statistically significant for ACLY. On univariate analysis, increased PSMA and GLUT1 expression in malignant glands was associated with shorter time-on-AS (HR: 5.06, [CI 95%: 1.83-13.94] and HR: 2.44, [CI 95%: 1.10-5.44], respectively). Malignant ACLY and benign gland PSMA and GLUT1 expression showed non-significant trends for such association. On multivariate analysis, overexpression of PSMA in malignant glands was an independent predictor of early PC progression (p = 0.006). This work suggests that the expression of metabolic enzymes determined by IHC on baseline diagnostic prostate biopsies may have value as biomarkers of risk for rapid PC progression. PSMA may be an independent predictor of risk for progression and should be investigated further in systematic studies.",
