  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nanocomposites (integrating the nano and composite technologies) for advanced fuel cells (NANOCOFC) demonstrate the great potential to reduce the operational temperature of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) significantly in the low temperature (LT) range 300-600ÂºC. NANOCOFC has offered the development of multi-functional materials composed of semiconductor and ionic materials to meet the requirements of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LTSOFC) and green energy conversion devices with their unique mechanisms. DESCRIPTION: This work reviews the recent developments relevant to the devices and the patents in LTSOFCs from nanotechnology perspectives that reports advances including fabrication methods, material compositions, characterization techniques and cell performances. CONCLUSION: Finally, the future scope of LTSOFC with nanotechnology and the practical applications are also discussed.",
