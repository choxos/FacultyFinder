  "title": "Update on autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This is a review of autoantibodies described in systemic sclerosis with an emphasis on recently published studies. In the past, most, if not all of the discussion on this topic focused on antinuclear antibodies, but it is now appreciated that autoantibodies to cytoplasmic, cell surface, intercellular and plasma components are also important in the context of systemic sclerosis. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of recent studies have highlighted the disease associations of autoantibodies and the potential pathogenic role of the more traditional autoantibodies, such as antitopoisomerase I and anticentromere antibodies. The recent identification of autoantibodies directed to the platelet-derived growth factor receptor is of particular interest because of its possible association with the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis. SUMMARY: Autoantibodies in systemic sclerosis are associated with demographic, diagnostic, pathological, and prognostic features of the disease. Emerging research on the pathogenic roles of newer autoantibodies provides valuable insights into disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets.",
