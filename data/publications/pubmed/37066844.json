  "title": "Applicant and Match Trends to Geriatric-Focused Postgraduate Medical Training in Canada: A Descriptive Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Physicians with postgraduate training in caring for older adults-geriatricians, geriatric psychiatrists, and Care of the Elderly family physicians (FM-COE)-have expertise in managing complex care needs. Deficits in the geriatric-focused physician workforce coupled with the aging demographic necessitate an increase in training and clinical positions. Descriptive analyses of data from established matching systems have not occurred to understand the preferences and outcomes of applicants to geriatric-focused postgraduate training. This study describes applicant and match trends for geriatric-focused postgraduate training in Canada. In this retrospective cohort study, data from the Canadian Resident Matching Service and FM-COE program directors were analysed to examine program quotas, applicants' preferences, and match outcomes by medical school and over time. Based on their first-choice specialty ranking, applicants to geriatric medicine and FM-COE signalled a preference to pursue these programs and tended to match successfully. The proportion of unfilled training positions has increased in recent years, and the number of applicants has not increased consistently over time. There is a disparity between applicants to geriatric-focused training and the health human resources to meet population-level needs. Garnering interest among medical trainees is essential to address access and equity gaps.",
