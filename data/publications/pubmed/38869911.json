  "title": "Adaptive Steroid Tapering Impedes Corticosteroid-free Remissions Compared with Forced Tapering in Clinical Trials of Ulcerative Colitis.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: It is unclear if steroid tapering protocols can affect clinical trial outcomes in ulcerative colitis [UC], particularly fixed versus adaptive steroid tapering. Fixed steroid tapering involves incremental dose decreases at prespecified intervals, and adaptive steroid tapering uses investigator discretion as determined by the patient's response. METHODS: In this post-hoc analysis from six clinical trials of UC [VARSITY, ACT 1, PURSUIT, GEMINI1, OCTAVE, and ULTRA2], responders to induction therapy with baseline corticosteroid use were considered as the primary population of interest. Adjustments were made to account for treat-through versus re-randomisation designs, and multivariate regression was performed to account for other potential confounding variables. The primary outcome was corticosteroid-free clinical remission [CR] at 1 year, and secondary outcomes were CR and endoscopic improvement. RESULTS: There was a total of 861 patients who had achieved clinical response after induction and were using corticosteroids. Within multivariate analysis, patients using adaptive steroid tapering regimens were less likely to achieve corticosteroid-free CR at 1 year (odds ratio [OR] 0.66 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.48-0.92], p = 0.015) but had increased odds for achieving CR at 1 year (OR 1.9 [95% CI 1.43-2.52], p < 0.001). The steroid tapering regimen was not associated with achievement of endoscopic improvement at 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with UC on corticosteroids in clinical trials, patients using adaptive steroid weaning regimens were less likely to achieve corticosteroid-free CR at 1 year but more likely to achieve CR at 1 year. Consideration should be given to implementing mandatory fixed steroid weaning protocols in future clinical trials of UC.",
