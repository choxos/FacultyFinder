  "title": "Re-examination of the Rey Word Recognition Test.",
  "abstract": "The Rey Word Recognition Test, a brief and simple to administer free-standing neurocognitive performance validity test, was examined in a large known-groups sample (122 credible patients and 134 non-credible patients). Total correctly recognized was the most sensitive score, identifying 54% of non-credible participants using a cut-off of â‰¤6, while maintaining specificity of approximately 90%. However, specifically rates were somewhat lower in credible individuals with <12 years of education or borderline intelligence, or who were bilingual (spoke English as a second language, or learned English concurrently with another language), indicating that cut-offs may require minor adjustment in these groups. Sensitivity rates were much higher in non-credible female versus male mild traumatic brain injury patients (mTBI; 68% versus 48% for total correct), suggesting that the Rey Word Recognition Test is particularly effective in identifying performance invalidity in female mTBI compensation seekers.",
