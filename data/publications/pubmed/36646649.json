  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is limited literature on the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) and associated mortality in hospitalized children. To systematically assess the worldwide incidence of AKI in hospitalized children to inform policymakers regarding appropriate health resource allocation. METHODS: Three different databases were searched (PubMed, Embase, Web of Sciences) from March 2012 to January 2022 without language or geographical restrictions. We included cohort and cross-sectional studies that reported AKI incidence in hospitalized children. Eligible studies had at least 100 participants and used the standard Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes criteria to define AKI. Two authors extracted data on the study and patients' characteristics and outcomes (incidence and AKI-associated mortality) and performed the risk of bias assessment. We used a random-effects meta-analysis to generate pooled estimates. RESULTS: We included 94 studies (202â€‰694 participants) from 26 countries. The incidence of any AKI was 26% (95% confidence interval: 22-29), and that of moderate-severe AKI was 14% (11-16). The incidence of AKI was similar in high-income 27% (23-32), low-middle-income 25% (13-38), and low-income 24% (12-39) countries. Overall, AKI-associated mortality was observed in 11% (9-13) of the pediatric population. AKI-associated mortality rate was highest at 18% (11-25) and 22% (9-38) in low-income and low-middle-income countries, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AKI was observed in one-quarter of the hospitalized children and is associated with increased mortality risk. Low-income and low-middle-income countries had observed higher mortality rates compared with high-income countries despite a similar AKI burden.",
