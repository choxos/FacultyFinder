  "title": "Surgical Management of Gossypiboma: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "Gossypiboma is a rarely reported surgical complication and refers to a retained surgical textile in the body after a procedure. The surrounding inflammation and reaction often manifest as acute pain and subsequently require additional surgery. We report the case of a 33-year-old female who presented with acute abdominal pain one month after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy secondary to a gunshot wound in her home country. A diagnosis of retained foreign body was made with radiological imaging and confirmed upon the retrieval of two surgical sponges after the operation. Due to the high morbidity and mortality as well as increased healthcare costs, strict protocols must be followed to avoid such outcomes.",
