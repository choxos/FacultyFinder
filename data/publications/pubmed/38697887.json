  "title": "A Qualitative Analysis of the Impact of Preoperative Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Total Knee Arthroplasty Surgical Experiences.",
  "abstract": "We qualitatively explored the impact of preoperative mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) on total knee arthroplasty (TKA) experiences. Participants (n = 10) who received MBSR prior to TKA participated in semi-structured interviews concerning their experiences with MBSR and its perceived impact on surgery. We analyzed interviews according to reflexive thematic analysis, and coded data into three main themes: 1) Impact of MBSR on surgery experiences; 2) Contributors to change; and 3) Motivations for participation. Participants noted they were able to relax, feel more confident, and cope more effectively during the preoperative period, and that others in their lives noticed positive changes following their participation in MBSR. Participants' openness to mindfulness and health-related beliefs and may have contributed to the positive impacts they experienced from MBSR. Participants described being motivated to participate in MBSR to help them prepare for their surgery and to learn new coping strategies. Participants described a strong level of commitment to the intervention. With further research, integration of MBSR into prehabilitation for TKA may be appropriate.",
