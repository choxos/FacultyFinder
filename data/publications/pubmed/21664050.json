  "title": "Synthesis of sulfated Y-doped zirconia particles and effect on properties of polysulfone membranes for treatment of wastewater containing oil.",
  "abstract": "Polysulfone (PSF) membranes are broadly applied in many fields owing to good physicochemical stability, resistance to oxidation and chlorine. But when treated with wastewater containing oil, PSF membranes are easily contaminated due to their hydrophilicity, causing declining flux and lifespan of the membranes thereby limiting their large scale applications. In order to enhance the hydrophilic and anti-fouling capability of PSF membranes for treating wastewater containing oil, sulfated Y-doped zirconia particles (SO(4)(2-)/ZrO(2)-Y(2)O(3) or SZY particles) were firstly synthesized and then doped into polysulfone to fabricate a novel hybrid membrane (SZY/PSF). The optimum preparation conditions of SZY particles were studied and determined. SZY particles were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), specific surface area and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Wastewater containing oil (80mg/L) was used to investigate the separation properties of SZY/PSF membranes. The results show that the oil concentration in the permeation is 0.67mg/L, which meets the recycle standard of the Chinese oil-field (SY/T 5329-94, oil concentration <10mg/L). It is concluded that doping SZY particles into polysulfone can reasonably resist membrane fouling and SZY/PSF membranes can be considered feasible in treating wastewater containing oil.",
