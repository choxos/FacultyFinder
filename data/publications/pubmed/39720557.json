  "title": "Oxidative Stress and Cancer Risk in Schistosomiasis.",
  "abstract": "Background: Schistosomiasis is considered one of the most devastating parasitic diseases globally, coming second only to malaria in terms of morbidity. The disease-causing parasite can inhabit the body for over a decade, leading to imbalances in the host's metabolic systems. The flukes and their eggs can illicit various immunological and metabolic complications resulting in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These are known to have several devastating effects on the host through increased oxidative stress, DNA mutation, and gene modifications, which can lead to fibrosis and cancer. Main Body: Here, we discuss oxidative stress and cancer risk in Schistosoma infection. The concept of ROS generation and the complex antioxidant systems that enable the parasite to evade oxidant insults and prolong its life span in the host are explored. Further, the various roles of ROS during the initiation and progression of schistosomiasis and its influence on the host are discussed. Finally, mechanisms linked to the risk of bladder cancer in Schistosoma haematobium (S. haematobium) infections are elucidated. Conclusion: Finally, we provide an opinion on how some of these mechanisms could give directions for future studies as well as provide a springboard for diagnostics and drug targeting in schistosomiasis.",
