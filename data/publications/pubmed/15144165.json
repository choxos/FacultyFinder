  "title": "From eminence-based practice to evidence-based practice: a paradigm shift.",
  "abstract": "Evidence-based medicine differs from the traditional approach to health care in that in addition to relying on clinical experience, expert opinion, and knowledge of pathophysiology for clinical decision-making, clinicians identify important knowledge gaps and information needs, formulate answerable questions, identify potentially relevant research, assess the validity of evidence and results, and apply research evidence to individual patients in a way that takes into account the patients' particular experiences, expectations, and values. It is becoming increasingly important that physicians learn the concepts of EBM because many EBM-related concepts have become a part of daily clinical practice. This article uses examples from orthopedics to outline EBM principles and methods and the advantages of EBM over traditional approaches. It also discusses challenges in implementing EBM and suggests EBM-related resources for physicians.",
