  "title": "Hepatitis C intervention research - Where are we now and where should we be heading?",
  "abstract": "In this paper we outline some of the major pending research questions that lie ahead in hepatitis C intervention research. We argue why these should be answered with randomised clinical trials and we stress how Egypt and other Arab countries can play an important role in this context. We delineate a number of design issues relevant to recent and future hepatitis C randomised clinical trials and provide insights on how and why randomised clinical trial designed in a pragmatic and evidence-based framework will efficiently answer pending research questions.",
