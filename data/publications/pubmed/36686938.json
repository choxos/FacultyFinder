  "title": "Enzymatic hydrolysis of low temperature alkali pretreated wheat straw using immobilized β-xylanase nanoparticles.",
  "abstract": "A low temperature alkali (LTA) pretreatment method was used to treat wheat straw. In order to obtain good results, different factors like temperature, incubation time, NaOH concentration and solid to liquid ratio for the pretreatment process were optimized. Wheat straw is a potential biomass for the production of monomeric sugars. The objective of the current study was to observe the saccharification (%) of wheat straw with immobilized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). For this purpose, immobilized MNPs of purified β-xylanase enzyme was used for hydrolysis of pretreated wheat straw. Wheat straw was pretreated using the LTA method and analyzed by SEM analysis. After completion of the saccharification process, saccharification% was calculated by using a DNS method. Scanning electron micrographs revealed that the hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin were partially removed and changes in the cell wall structure of the wheat straw had caused it to become deformed, increasing the specific surface area, so more fibers of the wheat straw were exposed to the immobilized β-xylanase enzyme after alkali pretreatment. The maximum saccharification potential of wheat straw was about 20.61% obtained after pretreatment with optimized conditions of 6% NaOH, 1/10 S/L, 30 °C and 72 hours. Our results indicate the reusability of the β-xylanase enzyme immobilized magnetic nanoparticles and showed a 15% residual activity after the 11th cycle. HPLC analysis of the enzyme-hydrolyzed filtrate also revealed the presence of sugars like xylose, arabinose, xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetrose. The time duration of the pretreatment has an important effect on thermal energy consumption for the low-temperature alkali method.",
