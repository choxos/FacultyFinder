  "title": "Dissemination and Implementation of Manualized Family-Based Treatment: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this article was to systematically review the literature pertaining to the dissemination and implementation of manualized family-based treatment (FBT). Several studies were found looking at the dissemination of FBT to sites beyond those of the primary research, mainly focusing on patient outcomes. Alternatively, articles were found which focused primarily on implementation outcomes, such as the barriers and facilitating factors for FBT uptake, a knowledge transfer model that could be applied to improve uptake, and team decision-making processes. It remains important to study the implementation of FBT in clinical practice due to the barriers identified in the literature.",
