  "title": "Prioritizing core components of successful transitions from child to adult mental health care: a national Delphi survey with youth, caregivers, and health professionals.",
  "abstract": "Youth accessing mental health care often experience a disruption in care as they attempt to transition between child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and adult mental health services (AMHS). Few studies have evaluated interventions seeking to improve the experience and outcomes of CAMHS-AMHS transitions, in part due to lack of consensus on what constitutes best practices in intervention success. As such, the aim of this study was to engage patients, caregivers, and clinicians to prioritize core components of successful CAMHS-AMHS transitions which can be used in the design or evaluation of transition interventions. As such, a Delphi study was conducted to determine core components of successful CAMHS-AMHS transitions. Guided by the principles of patient-oriented research, three balanced expert panels consisting of youth, caregivers, and clinicians ranked and provided feedback on the importance and feasibility of core components of CAMHS-AMHS transitions. Components endorsed as feasible or important with â‰¥ 70% agreement from any panel moved to the next round. As a result, a list of 26 core components of CAMHS-AMHS transitions has been refined which can be used in the design, implementation, or evaluation of interventions intended to improve transition experiences and outcomes for youth in mental health care. Youth and families were engaged in an expert advisory role throughout the research process, contributing their important perspectives to the design and implementation of this study, as well as interpretation of the findings.",
