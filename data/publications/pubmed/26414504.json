  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a leading cardiovascular risk factor and a major determinant of left ventricular mass. Te aim of this study was to assess electrocardiographic (ECG) changes associated with hypertension in a large cohort of young and healthy adults. METHODS: Healthy individuals aged 25–41 years without known cardiovascular disease were enrolled in a population based cohort study. Resting 12-lead ECG and ambulatory 24-hour BP measurement were obtained using validated devices. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to assess the relationships between ECG parameters and daytime hypertension, defined as systolic daytime BP≥140, diastolic BP≥90 mmHg or use of antihypertensive treatment. RESULTS: Daytime hypertension was present among 430 of 2070 (21%) participants. Significant linear relationships were observed between daytime hypertension with RR interval (odds ratio (OR) 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 (0.78; 0.92)), R-wave amplitude in leads I and II (OR (95% CI) 2.04 (1.30; 3.19) and 1.61 (1.15; 2.24), and S-wave amplitudes in leads aVR, V1 and V2 with ORs (95% CI) of 3.28 (1.93; 5.59), 2.15 (1.51; 3.08) and 1.47 (1.18; 1.83), respectively. We also observed linear associations between daytime hypertension and T-wave amplitudes in leads V1 (OR (95% CI) 4.83 (2.35; 9.91)), V2 (2.18 (1.43; 3.32)), V4 (0.48 (0.29; 0.80)) and V5 (0.37 (0.19; 0.72)). CONCLUSION: Several ECG parameters are independently associated with daytime hypertension among young and healthy adults. This is one of the first studies to show significant relationships between T wave amplitude and hypertension.",
