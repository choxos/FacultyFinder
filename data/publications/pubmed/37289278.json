  "title": "Impact of Prenatal Diagnosis of Critical Congenital Heart Disease on Preoperative and Postoperative Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the relationship of prenatal diagnosis of critical congenital heart disease (CHD) to preoperative and postoperative patient findings. Retrospective analysis of neonates with critical CHD who underwent cardiothoracic surgery at one of four centers in North Carolina between 2008 and 2013. Surgical data collected by sites for submission to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) and the North Carolina CHD Lifespan Database were queried. There were 715 patients with STS records; 558 linked to the NC-CHD database. Patients with prenatal diagnosis had a lower incidence of preoperative risk factors, including need for mechanical ventilation and presence of shock. However, prenatally diagnosed patients had worse short-term outcomes, including higher operative mortality, higher incidence of select postoperative complications, and longer LOS. There was no difference in one-year mortality. Our findings are consistent with current literature which suggests that prenatal diagnosis of critical CHD is associated with a more optimized preoperative clinical status. However, we found that patients with prenatal diagnoses had less favorable postoperative outcomes. This needs to be investigated further, but may be secondary to patient-specific factors, such as CHD disease severity.",
