  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intimate Partner violence (IPV) among pregnant women is a significant problem of public health importance. Nevertheless, there are relatively few studies which have examined the phenomenon in sub-Saharan settings. The aim of this study was to provide an overview of the prevalence, perpetrators, and associated factors of IPV during pregnancy in Kenya. METHODS: We were making use of the 2014 Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) data and included women and girls of reproductive age (15-49 years) who have ever been pregnant ([Formula: see text]). A weighted sample of respondents who have experienced violence during pregnancy ([Formula: see text]) were selected for further bivariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses in order to examine the association between IPV and socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: The prevalence of violence among pregnant women in Kenya was 9.2%, perpetrated mostly by the current husband or partner (47.6%), followed by the former husband or partner (31.5%). Physical violence was the most common (78.6%), followed by emotional (67.8%) and sexual (34.8%). Having one or two children ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]), having secondary or higher education ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) and being 18 years and above at first cohabitation ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) and at sexual debut ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) were significantly associated with fewer reports of violence during pregnancy. Pregnant women who were divorced, separated or widowed ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]), who were employed ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]), who had witnessed their fathers beat their mothers ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) and who had primary education ([Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]) were significantly more likely to experience violence. CONCLUSIONS: To prevent violence among pregnant women in Kenya, training health care providers should go hand in hand with interventions sensitising and mobilising community members, both addressing the socio-demographic drivers of IPV during pregnancy and directing a particular attention to the most vulnerable ones.",
