  "title": "Spermidine alkaloid and glycosidic constituents of Vietnamese Homalium cochinchinensis.",
  "abstract": "Phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of Homalium cochinchinensis led to the isolation of secondary metabolites belonging to the spermidine alkaloid, glycoside, depsidone and phenol classes. Of the eleven secondary metabolites isolated in this study, two spermidine alkaloids, dovyalicins H (1) and I (2), which belong to a rare group among this class, and six glycosides (3-8) are previously undescribed. The structures of all new isolates were determined by interpretation of spectroscopic and spectrometric data. In this report, the structural elucidation of these unprecedented secondary metabolites (1-8) is described.",
