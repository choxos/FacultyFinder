  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical practice guidelines recommend ustekinumab as a first-line biological treatment option for moderately-to-severely active Crohn's disease (CD). However, there is limited real-world effectiveness and safety data in bio-naïve patients. AIMS: To assess ustekinumab effectiveness and safety in bio-naïve CD patients. METHODS: Medical charts were reviewed retrospectively at seven Canadian centers. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving clinical remission at Month 6 following ustekinumab initiation. Secondary outcomes included clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic response, and remission at Months 4, 6 and 12. Ustekinumab safety was assessed over the one-year follow-up period. RESULTS: 158 charts were reviewed. Clinical remission was achieved by 50.0% (36/72), 67.7% (105/155), and 73.7% (84/114) of patients at Months 4, 6, and 12, respectively. At these study timepoints, biochemical remission was observed in 65.2% (43/66), 71.6% (63/88), and 73.9% (68/92) of patients. At Months 6 and 12, endoscopic remission was observed in 40.5% (15/37) and 56.3% (27/48) of patients, respectively. Most participants (93.5%; 145/155) persisted on ustekinumab through Month 12. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. CONCLUSION: In this real-world study, ustekinumab presents as an effective first-line biologic for induction and maintenance of remission among bio-naïve Canadian patients with moderately-to-severely active CD.",
