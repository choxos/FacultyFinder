  "title": "Outcomes of bariatric surgery in geriatric patients ≥ 65 years: single institution study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is an epidemic with an increasing incidence in geriatric individuals also. The aim of the present study is to determine the outcomes in geriatric patients ≥ 65 years, who underwent Bariatric Surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review was performed of prospectively collected data on geriatric patients (age 65 to 80 years) who had undergone bariatric surgery at a single institution from Jan. 2010 to Dec. 2013. A cohort of adult patients (age 17 to 64 years) were matched for comparative evaluation who also underwent bariatric surgery in the same period. The data analyzed included gender, co-morbidities, weight (loss), complications, and resolution of co-morbidities. RESULTS: 184 (7.3%) patients 65 years and older were identified out of 2508 patients who had bariatric surgery between January 2010 and December 2013. These were compared with 184 patients matched for types of surgery. Out of 184 patients in each group, 53 (28.8%) had undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 39 (21.2%) one anastomosis gastric bypass, and 92 (50%) sleeve gastrectomy. The average age was 68.7 years and 49.85 years in the geriatric and adult groups respectively. Average preoperative weight and BMI were 106.71 kg and117.69 kg and 42.59 kg/m[2] and 43.08 kg/m[2] in the geriatric and adult groups respectively. The co-morbid conditions were significantly more in the geriatric group. The weight (loss), nutrient deficiencies, and resolution of co-morbid conditions were similar in both groups. There were three major complications in the adult group and two in the geriatric group. One mortality was documented in the adult group from pulmonary embolus. CONCLUSION: The outcomes of bariatric surgery in geriatric patients in this study were similar to that in adults. Our study confirms the findings of previous published studies that bariatric surgery could be a safe and effective treatment option in a selected geriatric population.",
