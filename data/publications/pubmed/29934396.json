  "title": "Overweight and obesity management strategies in survivors of paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: a systematic review protocol.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common paediatric cancer. Survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (SALL) are at risk of obesity and related cardiometabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke and cardiovascular events. Therefore, it is important to address obesity in this population as this may help mitigate future cardiometabolic comorbidities. In this systematic review, we aim to assess current treatment strategies including lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy and bariatric surgery to manage overweight and obesity in SALL. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will search the following databases for primary studies: CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In addition, unpublished primary studies will be searched in ClinicalTrials.gov as well as conference proceedings, presentations, abstracts, editorials and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I. Reviewers will perform title, abstract, and full-text screening as well as data abstraction and risk of bias assessment independently with a third reviewer to be consulted to resolve disagreements. Searches will be run and updated through May 1st, 2018. The overall quality of the evidence will be determined using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria for each outcome. A meta-analysis will be performed if two studies deploying similar interventions, populations, and design and outcomes are identified. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As individual patient data will not be included, we do not require ethics approval. This review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
