  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To suggest a practical approach for the application of data from the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). RECENT FINDINGS: The COMPASS trial showed that low-dose rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus daily aspirin was superior to aspirin alone in reducing major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, and major adverse limb events among patients with stable atherosclerotic vascular disease, including those with PAD. The risk for major bleeding, however, was higher with rivaroxaban plus aspirin. Critical limb ischemia at baseline (rest pain, ulcer, or gangrene), previous limb or foot amputation, or a history of peripheral revascularization surgery or stenting were independently associated with increased major adverse limb events within the trial. SUMMARY: Intensification of antithrombotic therapy with low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin should be considered in low bleeding risk PAD patients who are at increased risk for ischemic and/or limb events. A practical approach for clinicians is presented to help incorporate COMPASS data into practice.",
