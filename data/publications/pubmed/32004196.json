  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Critical care physicians usually get involved in the care of patients with severe UGIB that is associated with hemodynamic compromise. We aim to provide the readers with evidence-based review of the management of patients with severe UGIB. RECENT FINDINGS: Proton pump inhibitors are the main pharmacologic intervention for UGIB, along with adequate resuscitation and timely endoscopic intervention. Endoscopic therapy should be performed as soon as haemodynamics stabilization is achieved, which requires team collaboration. Several radiologic interventions are now commonly used as a second-line intervention after endoscopy. SUMMARY: The management of severe UGIB requires multidisciplinary collaboration, prompt recognition and resuscitation, carful use of blood products, early correction of coagulopathy, and early endoscopic or radiologic interventions.",
