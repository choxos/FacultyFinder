  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine whether accurate inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) tumor lateralization is associated with improved clinical outcomes following the surgical treatment of Cushing disease. METHODS: The presented study was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines. Data regarding patient demographics, IPSS tumor lateralization, and postoperative endocrinologic outcomes were abstracted and pooled with random effects meta-analysis models. Additional meta-regression models were used to examine the association between the accuracy of IPSS tumor lateralization and postoperative outcomes (recurrence/persistence or remission/cure). Statistical analyses were performed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (significance of P < 0.05). RESULTS: Seventeen eligible articles were identified, yielding data on 461 patients. Within average follow-up duration (∼59 months), the rate of correct IPSS tumor lateralization was 69% [95% confidence interval: 61%, 76%], and the rate of postoperative remission/cure was 78% [67%, 86%]. Preoperative IPSS tumor lateralization was concordant with magnetic resonance imaging lateralization for 53% of patients [40%, 66%]. There was no significant association between the rate of correct IPSS tumor lateralization and postoperative remission/cure among study-level data (P = 0.735). Additionally, there was no association among subgroup analyses for studies using stimulatory agents during IPSS (corticotropin-releasing hormone or desmopressin, P = 0.635), nor among subgroup analyses for adult (P = 0.363) and pediatric (P = 0.931) patients. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data suggest that the rate of correct IPSS tumor lateralization may not be positively associated with postoperative remission or cure in patients with Cushing disease. These findings bring into question the utility of IPSS tumor lateralization in the context of preoperative planning and surgical approach rather than confirming a pituitary source.",
