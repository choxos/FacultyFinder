  "title": "Predictors of Mortality in Patients Treated with Veno-Arterial ECMO for Cardiogenic Shock Complicating Acute Myocardial Infarction: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mortality for patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for cardiogenic shock (CS) complicating acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains high. This meta-analysis aims to identify factors that predict higher risk of mortality after VA-ECMO for AMI. METHODS: We meta-analyzed mortality after VA-ECMO for CS complicating AMI and the effect of factors from systematically selected studies published after 2009. RESULTS: 72 studies (10,276 patients) were included with a pooled mortality estimate of 58 %. With high confidence in estimates, failure to achieve TIMI III flow and left main culprit were identified as factors associated with higher mortality. With low-moderate confidence, older age, high BMI, renal dysfunction, increasing lactate, prothrombin activity < 50%, VA-ECMO implantation after revascularization, and non-shockable ventricular arrythmias were identified as factors associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: These results provide clinicians with a framework for selecting patients for VA-ECMO for CS complicating AMI.",
