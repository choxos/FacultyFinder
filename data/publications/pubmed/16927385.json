  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the predictors of dropout and remission in the treatment of adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN) using family therapy. METHOD: Data derived from a randomized clinical trial comparing short and long term family therapy for adolescents with AN were used. A rotated component analysis was employed to reduce the number of variables and to address problems of collinearity and multiple testing. Dropout was defined as participating in less than 80% of the assigned therapy. Participants were classified as remitted if they obtained an ideal body weight greater than 95% and a global eating disorder Examination score within two standard deviations of community norms at the end of 12 months. RESULTS: Co-morbid psychiatric disorder and being randomized to longer treatment predicted greater dropout. The presence of co-morbid psychiatric disorder, being older, and problematic family behaviors led to lower rates of remission. A reduction of child behavioral symptoms, a decline in problematic family behaviors, and early weight gain were all within treatment changes that increased the chance of remission. CONCLUSION: Co-morbid psychiatric disorder, family behaviors, and early response to treatment are important factors when predicting dropout and remission in family therapy for adolescent AN.",
