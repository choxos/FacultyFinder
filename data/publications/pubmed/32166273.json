  "title": "Mortality Risk Profiles for Sepsis: A Novel Longitudinal and Multivariable Approach.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: To determine if a set of time-varying biological indicators can be used to: 1) predict the sepsis mortality risk over time and 2) generate mortality risk profiles. DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: Nine Canadian ICUs. SUBJECTS: Three-hundred fifty-six septic patients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Clinical data and plasma levels of biomarkers were collected longitudinally. We used a complementary log-log model to account for the daily mortality risk of each patient until death in ICU/hospital, discharge, or 28 days after admission. The model, which is a versatile version of the Cox model for gaining longitudinal insights, created a composite indicator (the daily hazard of dying) from the \"day 1\" and \"change\" variables of six time-varying biological indicators (cell-free DNA, protein C, platelet count, creatinine, Glasgow Coma Scale score, and lactate) and a set of contextual variables (age, presence of chronic lung disease or previous brain injury, and duration of stay), achieving a high predictive power (conventional area under the curve, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.86-0.94). Including change variables avoided misleading inferences about the effects of day 1 variables, signifying the importance of the longitudinal approach. We then generated mortality risk profiles that highlight the relative contributions among the time-varying biological indicators to overall mortality risk. The tool was validated in 28 nonseptic patients from the same ICUs who became septic later and was subject to 10-fold cross-validation, achieving similarly high area under the curve. CONCLUSIONS: Using a novel version of the Cox model, we created a prognostic tool for septic patients that yields not only a predicted probability of dying but also a mortality risk profile that reveals how six time-varying biological indicators differentially and longitudinally account for the patient's overall daily mortality risk.",
