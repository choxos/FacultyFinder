  "title": "Editorial Commentary: Labral Reconstruction: Some Early Positive Signals, and Now the Challenge Is Ours.",
  "abstract": "Adults between the ages of 40 and 49 with hip injuries can be challenging to treat, as they are often deemed \"too young\" for hip arthroplasty and yet have less predictable outcomes after hip arthroscopy. Moreover, in this population, hip arthroscopy with labral repair results in greater risk of treatment failure than labral reconstruction. Subclinical degenerative changes to the labral tissue may be responsible for this finding. In my practice, however, labral reconstruction is generally reserved for scenarios such as a failed labral repair in the setting of poor tissue, labral hypoplasia/calcification in the primary setting (<2 mm viable cuff of tissue), or complex irreparable tissue in the primary setting.",
