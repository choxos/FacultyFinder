  "title": "Risk Factors for Developing Low Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate and Albuminuria in Living Kidney Donors.",
  "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: Chronic kidney disease is associated with significant morbidity and mortality in the general population, but little is known about the incidence and risk factors associated with developing low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and moderate-severe albuminuria in living kidney donors following nephrectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, population-based cohort study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: Kidney donors in Alberta, Canada. EXPOSURE: Donor nephrectomy between May 2001 and December 2017. OUTCOME: Two eGFR measurements <45 mL/min/1.73 m[2] or 2 measurements of moderate or severe albuminuria from 1-year postdonation onwards that were at least 90 days apart. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Associations between potential risk factors and the primary outcome were assessed using Cox proportional hazard regression analyses. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years (IQR, 4.7-12.6 years), 47 of 590 donors (8.0%) developed sustained low eGFR or moderate-severe albuminuria with an incidence rate of 9.2 per 1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval, 6.6-11.8). The median time for development of this outcome beyond the first year after nephrectomy was 2.9 years (IQR, 1.4-8.0 years). Within the first 4 years of follow-up, a 5 mL/min/1.73 m[2] lower predonation eGFR increased the hazard of developing postdonation low eGFR or moderate-severe albuminuria by 26% (adjusted HR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.10-1.44). Furthermore, donors were at higher risk of developing low eGFR or albuminuria if they had evidence of predonation hypertension (adjusted HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.28-4.96) or postdonation diabetes (adjusted HR, 4.72; 95% CI, 1.54-14.50). LIMITATIONS: We lacked data on certain donor characteristics that may affect long-term kidney function, such as race, smoking history, and transplant-related characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: A proportion of kidney donors at an incidence rate of 9.2 per 1,000 person-years will develop low eGFR or albuminuria after donation. Donors with lower predonation eGFR, predonation hypertension, and postdonation diabetes are at increased risk of developing this outcome.",
