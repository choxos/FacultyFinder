  "title": "Gravid uterus in an umbilical hernia.",
  "abstract": "Umbilical hernias large enough to contain a gravid uterus are rare. We report a case of a woman with prolapse of a gravid uterus through a previously repaired umbilical hernia. Our plans for elective surgery with caesarean section and hernia repair were foiled by poor compliance. The hernia was repaired during an emergency caesarean section. We provide details of her management and briefly review the literature on umbilical hernias and pregnancy. Surgical management offers an opportunity for hernia repair and can ensure a safe delivery for the mother and child.",
