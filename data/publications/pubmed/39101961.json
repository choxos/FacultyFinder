  "title": "Prognostic value of quality of life and functional status in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Functional health status is increasingly being recognized as a viable endpoint in heart failure (HF) trials. We sought to assess its prognostic impact and relationship with traditional clinical outcomes in patients with HF. METHODS: MEDLINE and Cochrane central were searched up to January 2021 for post hoc analyses of trials or observational studies that assessed independent association between baseline health/functional status, and mortality and hospitalization in patients with HF across the range of left ventricular ejection fractions to evaluate the prognostic ability of NYHA class [II, III, IV], KCCQ, MLHFQ, and 6MWD. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals were pooled. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included. Relative to NYHA I, NYHA class II (HR 1.54 [1.16-2.04]; p < 0.01), NYHA class III (HR 2.08 [1.57-2.77]; p < 0.01), and NYHA class IV (HR 2.53 [1.25-5.12]; p = 0.01) were independently associated with increased risk of mortality. 6MWD (per 10 m) was associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.98 [0.98-0.99]; p < 0.01). A 5-point increase in KCCQ-OSS (HR 0.94 [0.91-0.96]; p < 0.01) was associated with decreased mortality. A high MLHFQ score (> 45) was significantly associated with increased mortality (HR 1.30 [1.14-1.47]; p < 0.01). NHYA class, 6MWD (per 10 m), KCCQ-OSS, and MLHFQ all significantly associated with all-cause mortality in patients with HF. CONCLUSION: Identifying such patients with poor health status using functional health assessment can offer a complementary assessment of disease burden and trajectory which carries a strong prognostic value.",
