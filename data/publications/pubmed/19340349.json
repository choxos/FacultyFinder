  "title": "Para-aortic arch abscess secondary to Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia.",
  "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common pathogen causing pneumonia in the community, hospital ward and intensive care unit. Although pneumonia is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, especially in elderly and immunocompromised patients, it is usually uncomplicated and resolves without complications. The case of a woman who developed a para-aortic abscess after a community-acquired S aureus pneumonia infection is presented. A number of diagnostic imaging modalities were used to reach the diagnosis. This complication has not been reported previously and it is likely secondary to suppurative lymphadenitis of a station 5 or 6 node. The patient was successfully managed nonsurgically with computed tomography-guided drainage and intravenous antibiotics.",
