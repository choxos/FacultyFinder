  "abstract": "Understanding the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people on immunosuppressive drugs, including those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), is critical for their protection. Vaccine induced protection requires antibodies, CD4[+] T cells, and CD8[+] T cells, but it is unclear if these are equally affected by immunomodulatory drugs. Here, we determined how humoral and cellular SARS-CoV-2 vaccination responses differed between people with RA and controls, and which drug classes impacted these responses. Blood was collected from participants with RA on immunomodulatory drugs and controls after their second, third, and fourth SARS-CoV-2 vaccinations. Receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibodies were quantified by ELISA. Spike-specific memory T cells were quantitated using flow cytometry. Linear mixed models assessed the impact of age, sex, and immunomodulatory drug classes on SARS-CoV-2 vaccination responses. Compared to non-RA controls (n = 35), participants with RA on immunomodulatory drugs (n = 62) had lower anti-RBD IgG and spike-specific CD4[+] T cell levels, but no deficits in spike-specific CD8[+] T cells, following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Use of costimulation inhibitors was associated with lower humoral responses. JAK inhibitors were associated with fewer spike-specific CD4[+] T cells. Participants with RA on immunomodulatory drugs mounted weaker responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, with different drug classes impacting the cellular and humoral compartments.",
