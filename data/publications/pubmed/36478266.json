  "abstract": "The visible and Mössbauer spectra of [Fe(II)(Por)L2] and [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes (where Por = protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) or tetra(p-sulfophenyl)porphyrin (TPPS) and L = an aliphatic or aromatic nitrogenous base) are reported and discussed. The results are compared to those of previously reported [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes (where Por = PPIX, TPPS, PMXPP, TPP, OMTBP and OEP; L = a nitrogenous aromatic ligand) and HbCO (where Hb = haemoglobin) and MyCO (where My = myoglobin). A new approach, to extracting information from the Mössbauer parameters has been developed by plotting those of the [Fe(II)(Por)L2] complexes against those of [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes for the same ligands, has yielded a series of trend lines that show a significant dependence on both the nature of the porphyrin and also of the nitrogenous ligand. Different trend lines were found for aromatic nitrogenous ligands to aliphatic nitrogenous ligands showing that the porphyrins could donate different amounts of charge to the Fe(II) cations as the L ligand changed, and hence, they display electron sink properties. From the plots, it was shown that haemoglobin and myoglobin both bind CO very strongly compared to the model complexes studied herein. Using the reported structural and Mössbauer data for the [Fe(II)(Por)L2] and [Fe(II)(Por)L(CO)] complexes, it proved possible and instructive to plot the Mössbauer parameters against a number of the bond lengths around the Fe(II) cations. The interpretation of the resulting trend lines both supported and facilitated the extension of our findings enabling further understanding of the geometry of the bonding in CO haemoglobin and CO myoglobin.",
