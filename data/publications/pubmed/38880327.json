  "abstract": "Water pollution caused by antibiotics and synthetic dyes and imminent energy crises due to limited fossil fuel resources are issues of contemporary decades. Herein, we address them by enabling the multifunctionality in dual Z-scheme MoS2/WO3-x/AgBiS2 across photolysis, photo Fenton-like, and night catalysis. Defect, basal, and facet-engineered WO3-x is modified with MoS2 and AgBiS2, which extended its photoresponse from the UV-NIR region, inhibited carrier recombination, and reduced carrier transfer resistance. The electric field rearrangement leads to a flow of electrons from MoS2 and AgBiS2 to WO3-x and intensifies the electron population, which is crucial for night catalysis. When MoS2/WO3-x/AgBiS2 was employed against doxycycline hydrochloride (DOXH), it removed 95.65, 81.11, and 77.92 % of DOXH in 100 min during photo-Fenton (PFR), night-Fenton (NFR), and photocatalytic (PCR) reactions, respectively. It also effectively removed 91.91, 98.17, 99.01, and 98.99 % of rhodamine B (RhB), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), and methylene orange (MO) in Fenton reactions, respectively. ESR analysis consolidates the ROS generation feature of MoS2/WO3-x/AgBiS2 using H2O2 with and without irradiation. This work provides a strategy to eliminate the deficiencies of WO3-x and is conducive to the evolution of applications seeking to combat environmental and energy crises.",
