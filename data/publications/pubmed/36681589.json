  "title": "Emergent superconducting fluctuations in compressed kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5.",
  "abstract": "The recent discovery of superconductivity (SC) and charge density wave (CDW) in kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) provides an ideal playground for the study of emergent electronic orders. Application of moderate pressure leads to a two-dome-shaped SC phase regime in CsV3Sb5 accompanied by the destabilizing of CDW phase. Nonetheless, the nature of this pressure-tuned SC state and its interplay with the CDW are yet to be explored. Here, we perform soft point-contact spectroscopy (SPCS) measurements in CsV3Sb5 to investigate the evolution of superconducting order parameter with pressure. Surprisingly, we find that the superconducting gap is significantly enhanced between the two SC domes, at which the zero-resistance temperature is suppressed and the transition is remarkably broadened. Moreover, the temperature-dependence of the SC gap in this pressure range severely deviates from the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) behavior, evidencing for strong Cooper pair phase fluctuations. These findings reveal the complex intertwining of the CDW with SC in the compressed CsV3Sb5, suggesting striking parallel to the cuprate superconductor La2-xBaxCuO4. Our results point to the essential role of charge degree of freedom in the development of intertwining electronic orders, and thus provide new constraints for theories.",
