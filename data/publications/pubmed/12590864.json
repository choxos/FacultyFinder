  "title": "Use of a nitinol stent to treat dysphagia post-laryngopharyngectomy.",
  "abstract": "Permanent dysphagia occurring after laryngectomy or laryngopharyngectomy is uncommon, and when it does occur, can usually be treated by periodic dilatation under general anaesthesia. Occasionally, however, conservative treatment is insufficient, and patients require long-term feeding via a gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube. We describe the case of a man with an anastamotic stricture post-pharyngectomy who underwent insertion of a nitinol stent across the stricture for treatment of dysphagia. The patient's swallowing was significantly improved in the short-term, however, ultimately, florid granulation tissue formation led to obstruction of the stent and a disappointing long-term result. This, to our knowledge, is the first documentation of the use of a stent to treat dysphagia in a patient post-laryngectomy or pharyngolaryngectomy.",
