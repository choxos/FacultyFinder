  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate published evidence on nocturia in men and derive expert recommendations. METHODS: The International Consultations on Urological Diseases-Société Internationale d'Urologie convened a Consultation of experts on male lower urinary tract symptoms. The Consultation assigned standardized levels of evidence and grades of recommendation to various studies of nocturia epidemiology, pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment. RESULTS: Evidence review and consensus recommendations were made in the areas of epidemiology, pathophysiology, assessment, and treatment. CONCLUSION: The review presents a condensed summary of the International Consultations on Urological Diseases-Société Internationale d'Urologie evaluation of nocturia, which offers contemporaneous expert consensus on this topic, with an assessment algorithm emphasizing the potential contribution of systemic conditions to the symptom.",
