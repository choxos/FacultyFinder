  "title": "Effects of Aerobic Dance on Cognition in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Regular aerobic exercises could improve global cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), such as aerobic dance a type of commonly practiced aerobic exercises. However, its effects remain debatable in improving the cognitive function in patients with MCI. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of aerobic dance on cognitive function among older adults with MCI. METHODS: We searched articles in the MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and The Cochrane Library databases from inception to 28 February 2019, with the following criteria: 1) randomized controlled trials; 2) older adults with MCI; 3) aerobic dance intervention. RESULTS: Five studies of 842 participants were identified. This meta-analysis showed that aerobic dance can significantly improve global cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination: MD = 1.43; 95% CI:[0.59, 2.27]; p = 0.0009; Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale: MD=-2.30; 95% CI:[-3.60, -1.00]; p = 0.0005), and delayed recall ability (SMD = 0.46;95% CI: [0.30, 0.62]; p < 0.00001) in older adults with MCI. In addition, have positive effects on improving executive function (Trial-Making Test A: MD = -2.37;95% CI:[-4.16, -0.58]; p = 0.010; Trial-Making Test B: MD = -16.0; 95% CI: [-30.03, -2.11]; p = 0.020) and immediate recall ability (SMD = 0.24;95% CI: [0.01, 0.46]; p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Aerobic dance significantly improves global cognitive function and memory in older adults with MCI. In addition, it also benefits executive function. However, due to the limitations as the review states, more randomized controlled trials with better study design and larger sample sizes should be conducted in the future research to make it much clearer.",
