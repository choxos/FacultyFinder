  "abstract": "RATIONALE: Advances in technology, infection control challenges-as with the COVID-19 pandemic-and evolutions in patient- and family-centered care highlight ideal aspects of ICU design and opportunities for enhancement. OBJECTIVES: To provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians, administrators, and healthcare architects to optimize design strategies in new or renovation projects. PANEL DESIGN: A guidelines panel of 27 members with experience in ICU design met virtually from the panel's inception in 2019 to 2024. The panel represented clinical professionals, architects, engineers, and clinician methodologists with expertise in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. A formal conflict of interest policy was followed throughout the guidelines-development process. METHODS: Embase, Medline, CINAHL, Central, and Proquest were searched from database inception to September 2023. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to determine certainty in the evidence and to formulate recommendations, suggestions, and practice statements for each Population, Intervention, Control, and Outcomes (PICO) question based on quality of evidence and panel consensus. Recommendations were provided when evidence was actionable; suggestions, when evidence was equivocal; and practice statements when the benefits of the intervention appeared to outweigh the risks, but direct evidence to support the intervention did not exist. RESULTS: The ICU Guidelines panel issued 17 recommendations based on 15 PICO questions relating to ICU architecture and design. The panel strongly recommends high-visibility ICU layouts, windows and natural lighting in all patient rooms to enhance sleep and recovery. The panel suggests integrated staff break/respite spaces, advanced infection prevention features, and flexible surge capacity. Because of insufficient evidence, the panel could not make a recommendation around in-room supplies, decentralized charting, and advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. CONCLUSIONS: This ICU design guidelines is intended to provide expert guidance for clinicians, administrators, and healthcare architects considering erecting a new ICU or revising an existing structure.",
