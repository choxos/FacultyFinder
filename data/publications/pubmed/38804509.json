  "title": "Investigating Canadian Radiology Residents' Personal Financial Literacy: A Nation-Wide Assessment.",
  "abstract": "Purpose: Canadian resident physicians carry large debt to finance their education, which impacts their wellness and their future decision making. The objective of this observational study is to assess the financial literacy of Canadian radiology residents through testing their financial knowledge and examining their current financial status. Methods: A survey was designed to assess the financial literacy and current financial status of radiology residents, which was distributed to Canadian radiology residents via Google Forms. Descriptive analyses on preliminary data and the association between level of training and financial quiz scores were obtained. Results: 104 valid responses from 16 universities were received. The majority (53%) of residents indicated that their debt was greater than $150 000. Residents on average scored 71% on the financial quiz and the scores were not associated with training level (P = .71). The majority (89%) of residents indicated a strong interest in a formal financial literacy curriculum, with 80% preferring a physician-led curriculum. Conclusion: Overall, residents face a high debt burden. Current resident physicians value a formal financial literacy curriculum as a part of their residency program despite existing financial knowledge. Most importantly, residents feel that a curriculum created with involvement of other physicians would be optimal.",
