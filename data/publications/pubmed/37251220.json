  "title": "Inflammatory cytokines associated with mild traumatic brain injury and clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) trigger a neuroinflammatory response, which leads to perturbations in the levels of inflammatory cytokines, resulting in a distinctive profile. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to synthesize data related to levels of inflammatory cytokines in patients with mTBI. The electronic databases EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PUBMED were searched from January 2014 to December 12, 2021. A total of 5,138 articles were screened using a systematic approach based on the PRISMA and R-AMSTAR guidelines. Of these articles, 174 were selected for full-text review and 26 were included in the final analysis. The results of this study demonstrate that within 24 hours, patients with mTBI have significantly higher levels of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (IL-1RA), and Interferon-γ (IFN-γ) in blood, compared to healthy controls in majority of the included studies. Similarly one week following the injury, patients with mTBI have higher circulatory levels of Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1/C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (MCP-1/CCL2), compared to healthy controls in majority of the included studies. The results of the meta-analysis also confirmed these findings by demonstrating significantly elevated blood levels of IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, and Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) in the mTBI population compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001), particularly in the acute stages (<7 days). Furthermore, it was found that IL-6, Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α), IL-1RA, IL-10, and MCP-1/CCL2 were associated with poor clinical outcomes following the mTBI. Finally, this research highlights the lack of consensus in the methodology of mTBI studies that measure inflammatory cytokines in the blood, and also provides direction for future mTBI research.",
