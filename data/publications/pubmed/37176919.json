  "title": "Omics Approaches in Invasion Biology: Understanding Mechanisms and Impacts on Ecological Health.",
  "abstract": "Invasive species and rapid climate change are affecting the control of new plant diseases and epidemics. To effectively manage these diseases under changing environmental conditions, a better understanding of pathophysiology with holistic approach is needed. Multiomics approaches can help us to understand the relationship between plants and microbes and construct predictive models for how they respond to environmental stresses. The application of omics methods enables the simultaneous analysis of plant hosts, soil, and microbiota, providing insights into their intricate relationships and the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions. This can help in the development of novel strategies for enhancing plant health and improving soil ecosystem functions. The review proposes the use of omics methods to study the relationship between plant hosts, soil, and microbiota, with the aim of developing a new technique to regulate soil health. This approach can provide a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying plant-microbe interactions and contribute to the development of effective strategies for managing plant diseases and improving soil ecosystem functions. In conclusion, omics technologies offer an innovative and holistic approach to understanding plant-microbe interactions and their response to changing environmental conditions.",
