  "title": "Mandatory reporting in the context of home visitation programs: intimate partner violence and children's exposure to intimate partner violence.",
  "abstract": "The mandatory reporting of intimate partner violence (IPV) is a controversial issue that is receiving increased attention. A related concern is whether children's exposure to IPV constitutes child maltreatment, making it reportable to child protective services. These issues have been relatively unexplored within the context of home visitation programs. A secondary analysis of qualitative data collected from community stakeholders, clients, and home visiting nurses in the Nurse-Family Partnership program was carried out. Participants' perceptions about mandatory reporting of IPV and reporting of children's exposure to IPV are highlighted. Emergent themes and implications for research, practice, and policy are discussed.",
