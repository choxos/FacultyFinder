  "title": "A Social-Ecological Model Exploring Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Screening Practices Among Antenatal Health Care Providers.",
  "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse health outcomes for the pregnant individual and their baby. Screening approaches for GDM have undergone several iterations, introducing variability in practice among healthcare providers. As such, our study aimed to explore the views of antenatal providers regarding their practices of, and counseling experiences on the topic of, GDM screening in Ontario. We conducted a qualitative, grounded theory study. The study population included antenatal providers (midwives, family physicians, and obstetricians) practicing in Hamilton, Ottawa, or Sudbury, Ontario. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and transcribed verbatim. Transcripts were analyzed using inductive coding upon which codes, categories, and themes were developed to generate a theory grounded in the data. Twenty-two participants were interviewed. Using the social-ecological theory, we created a model outlining four contextual levels that shaped the experiences of GDM counseling and screening: Intrapersonal factors included beliefs, knowledge, and skills; interpersonal factors characterized the patient-provider interactions; organizational strengths and challenges shaped collaboration and health services infrastructure; and finally, guidelines and policies were identified as systemic barriers to health care access and delivery. A focus on patient-centered care was a guiding principle for all care providers and permeated all four levels of the model. Patient-centered care and close attention to barriers and facilitators across intrapersonal, interpersonal, organizational, and policy domains can minimize the impact of variations in GDM screening guidelines. Among care providers, there is a desire for additional skill development related to GDM counseling, and for national consensus on optimal screening guidelines.",
