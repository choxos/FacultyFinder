  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The Zika virus epidemic has been declared a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization. We describe the mucocutaneous features and histologic correlation in a patient with the acute Zika virus infection. OBSERVATIONS: We observed the presence of a diffuse papular descending eruption, petechiae on the palate, and hyperemic sclerae in a 44-year-old man returning from Puerto Rico with confirmatory testing for the Zika virus. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A detailed awareness of mucocutaneous findings associated with Zika virus infection will support its early recognition and will facilitate elimination of Zika infection from consideration for concerned patients who present with other, more common erythematous eruptions.",
