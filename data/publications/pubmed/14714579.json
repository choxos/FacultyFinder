  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between polymorphism of the anglotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene and the blood pressure response to ACE inhibition in a hypertensive cohort. Imidapril (5-10 mg/day) or benazepril (10-20 mg/day) was administered for 6 weeks to 517 essential hypertensives. ACE gene polymorphism was examined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method and the patients were classified as having the 190-bp deletion homozygous (DD) genotype, the 490-bp insertion homozygous (II) genotype, or the 490-bp insertion, 190-bp deletion heterozygous (ID) genotype. The achieved change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP) was analyzed for association with genotypes at the ACE gene locus. The DD genotype was observed in 132 patients (25.5%), the ID genotype in 255 patients (49.3%), and the II genotype in 130 patients (25.2%). The SBP reductions in the patients with the DD genotype, II genotype, and ID genotype were -14.5 +/- 12.7 mmHg, -14.3 +/- 13.1 mmHg and -14.0 +/- 12.2 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.94). The DBP reductions in the patients with the DD genotype, II genotype, and ID genotype were -8.7 +/- 7.4 mmHg, -8.7 +/- 7.7 mmHg and -8.5 +/- 6.7 mmHg, respectively (p = 0.96). There was no significant association between the ACE gene polymorphisms and the response to ACE inhibition. These results suggest that ACE genotype does not predict the blood pressure-lowering response to antihypertensive treatment with ACE inhibition.",
