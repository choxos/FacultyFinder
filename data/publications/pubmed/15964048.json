  "title": "RDX and TNT residues from live-fire and blow-in-place detonations.",
  "abstract": "Snow was used as a collection medium to examine 1,3,5-hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitrotriazine (RDX) and 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) residues post-detonation of 60-, 81-, and 120-mm mortar rounds, 105- and 155-mm howitzer rounds, M67 hand grenades, 40-mm rifle grenades, and blocks of C4. Residue-covered snow samples were collected, processed, and analyzed for explosives without cross-contamination from previous detonations and other potential matrix interferences. Detonation trials were performed following standard military live-fire and blow-in-place techniques. When possible, replicate munitions were detonated under similar conditions to provide a more reliable estimation of the mass of unconsumed high explosive residues. Overall the amount of energetic residues deposited from live-fire detonations were considerably less than the energetic residues deposited by blow-in-place detonations.",
