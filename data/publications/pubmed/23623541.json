  "title": "The Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services (RAAPS): providers' assessment of its usefulness in their clinical practice settings.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate health providers' use of the Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services (RAAPS) screening tool to identify adolescent high-risk behaviors, its ease of use and efficiency, and its impact on provider/patient discussions of sensitive risk behaviors. METHOD: This mixed methods descriptive study used an online survey to assess providers' use of the RAAPS and theirÂ perspectives on its implementation and effect on adolescent-provider communication. The survey was completed by providers from a variety of settings across the United States (N = 201). RESULTS: Quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that the RAAPS facilitated identification of risk behaviors and risk discussions and provided efficient and consistent assessments; 86% of providers believed that the RAAPS positively influenced their practice. DISCUSSION: Adoption of the RAAPS in practice settings could lead to more effective adolescent preventive services by giving providers a tool to systematically assess and identify adolescents at risk. Implementation of RAAPS offers health providers an efficient, consistent, and \"adolescent friendly\" way to identify risky behaviors and open the discussion needed to tailor interventions to meet their needs.",
