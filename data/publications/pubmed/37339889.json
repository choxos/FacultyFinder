  "abstract": "Mutations in the complement factor I (CFI) gene have previously been identified as causes of recurrent CNS inflammation. We present a case of a 26-year-old man with 18 episodes of recurrent meningitis, who had a variant in CFI(c.859G>A,p.Gly287Arg) not previously associated with neurologic manifestations. He achieved remission with canakinumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeted at interleukin-1 beta.",
