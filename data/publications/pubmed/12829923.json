  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The availability of cadaveric organs is the major problem in transplantation today. METHODS: A retrospective review of donors in a single organ procurement organization (OPO) was performed. Donors were divided into three eras: before, during, and after the presence of a local lung transplant program. Lung procurement rates by OPO in the United States in 1999 and 2000 were also retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Lung transplant rates were higher in the presence of a local lung program: 4.9% at baseline, 19.1% with a local program, and 7.1% after closure of the local lung program (P<0.01). In the United States, 12.4% of lungs available in OPOs with local lung programs are transplanted, versus 8.9% in OPOs without a local program (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Even if donor management protocols are maintained, closure of a local lung program decreases lung recovery rates. This observation supports the importance of maintaining local programs to maximize organ recovery rates.",
