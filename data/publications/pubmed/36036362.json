  "title": "In silico identification of potential drug-like molecules against G glycoprotein of Nipah virus by molecular docking, DFT studies, and molecular dynamic simulation.",
  "abstract": "Nipah virus (NiV) is a novel zoonotic pathogen that belongs to the Paramyxovirus family. The pathogen has infected a number of people in countries like Bangladesh, India, Singapore, and Malaysia with high mortality rates. Although the NiV has been classified as a biosafety level four pathogen (BSL-4), there is no drug approved for treatment against it. In this study, the G glycoprotein of the NiV was chosen as an antiviral target. Based on ADMET criteria, BBB- and BBB + group compounds were screened out of the Gold & platinum Asinex library containing 211620 compounds. After careful evaluation, the selected ligands were then virtually screened to identify the potential inhibitors against the G glycoprotein of the NiV through molecular docking, density functional theory (DFT), and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation studies. In our study we identified 5-(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-yl)-2-[(3-fluorobenzyl)sulfanyl]-5,8-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4,7(1H,6H)-dione (from BBB- group) and 7,7-Dimethyl-1-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(4-morpholinylcarbonyl)-7,8-dihydro-2,5(1H,6H)-quinolinedione) (from BBB + group) as potential compounds for the prevention and treatment of NiV related diseases.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.
