  "abstract": "Epidemiological models are key tools in assessing intervention policies for population health management. Statistical models, fitted with survey or health system data, can be combined with lab and field studies to provide reliable predictions of future population-level disease dynamics distributions and the effects of interventions. All too often, however, the end result of epidemiological modeling and cost-effectiveness studies is in the form of a report or journal paper. These are inherently limited in their coverage of locations, policy options, and derived outcome measures. Here, we describe a tool to support population health policy planning. The tool allows users to explore simulations of various policies, to view and compare interventions spanning multiple variables, time points, and locations. The design's modular architecture, and data representation separate the modeling methods, the outcome measures calculations, and the visualizations, making each component easily replaceable. These advantages make it extremely versatile and suitable for multiple uses.",
