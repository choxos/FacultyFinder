  "title": "Predictors, Treatments, and Outcomes of Do-Not-Resuscitate Status in Acute Myocardial Infarction Patients (from a Nationwide Inpatient Cohort Study).",
  "abstract": "Little is known about how frequently do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders are placed in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the types of patients in which they are placed, treatment strategies or clinical outcomes of such patients. Using the United States (US) National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database from 2015 to 2018, we identified 2,767,549 admissions that were admitted to US hospitals and during the hospitalization received a principle diagnosis of AMI, of which 339,270 (12.3%) patients had a DNR order (instigated both preadmission and during in-hospital stay). Patients with a DNR status were older (median age 83 vs 65, p < 0.001), more likely to be female (53.4% vs 39.3%, p < 0.001) and White (81.0% vs 73.3%, p < 0.001). Predictors of DNR status included comorbidities such as heart failure (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.45 to 1.48), dementia (OR: 2.53, 95% CI: 2.50 to 2.55), and cancer. Patients with a DNR order were less likely to undergo invasive management or be discharged home (13.5% vs 52.8%), with only 1/3 receiving palliative consultation. In hospital mortality (32.7% vs 4.6%, p < 0.001) and MACCE (37.1% vs 8.8%, p < 0.001) were higher in the DNR group. Factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality among patients with a DNR order included a STEMI presentation (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 2.84 to 2.96) and being of Black (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.26 to 1.33), Hispanic (OR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.32 to 1.41) or Asian/Pacific Islander (OR: 1.56, 95% CI:1.49-race. In conclusion, AMI patients with a DNR status were older, multimorbid, less likely to receive invasive management, with only one third of patients with DNR status referred for palliative care.",
