  "title": "A Reciprocal-Amplifiable Fluorescence Sensing Platform via Replicated Hybridization Chain Reaction for Hosting Concatenated Multi-Ag Nanoclusters as Signal Reporter.",
  "abstract": "Exploring the replication of hybridization chain reaction HCR (rHCR) for reciprocal amplification is intriguing in biosensing and bioanalysis. Herein, we develop a rHCR-based fluorescence platform that is manipulated by the combination of a specific DNA trigger (T) and a T-analogous amplicon (T*), thereby concatenating multi green-emissive Ag nanoclusters (mgAgNCs) for amplifiable signal readout. Four well-designed hairpins (H1 recognizing T, H2, H3, and H4) with sequential complements are executed to operate rHCR. The termini of H1/H3 are merged to hybridize an inhibiting strand (I). The parent scaffold for mgAgNCs is separated into two splits (C4AC4T and C3GT4) that are individually overhung in H2/H4. The presence of T activates the first HCR amplifier through cross-hybridization of four reactive hairpins for forming HCR duplexes. The next invasion of a complex (T*Â·I) drives I to hybridize the tandem repeats in H1/H3, so that the displaced T* functions as T to catalyze the second amplifier rHCR for feeding back more hairpin assemblies with rapid reaction kinetics. In the shared rHCR polymers, the parent scaffolds (C4AC4TC3GT4) in H2/H4 are collectively concatenated for the preferential clustering of mgAgNCs adducts, which cooperatively emit enormous T-responsive fluorescence signal. Because of the localization of T in HCR products, an alternative amplicon T* is introduced to drive rHCR progress via DNA strand displacement, generating more nucleating sites of emitters. Thus, the rational combination of nonenzymatic rHCR and label-free fluorescent concatemers would create a reciprocal signal amplification, achieving a simplified, rapid, and highly sensitive assay down to femtomolar concentrations.",
