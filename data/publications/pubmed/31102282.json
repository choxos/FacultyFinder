  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Progranulin represents an adipokine putatively mediating insulin resistance and inflammation. Data in humans are sparse, and the source of circulating progranulin in obesity is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Serum progranulin concentrations and subcutaneous (sc) as well as visceral (vis) adipose tissue (AT) progranulin expression were quantified in a large cohort of patients with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery (BS) (n = 153) or a low-calorie diet (LCD) (n = 121). COHORTS AND METHODS: Paired serum and AT mRNA samples were obtained from patients with severe obesity undergoing BS (ROBS cohort; Research in Obesity and Bariatric Surgery). Serum progranulin was measured by ELISA in both cohorts, and AT mRNA expression was analysed by quantitative real-time PCR in bariatric patients. RESULTS: There was no gender-specific effect in serum progranulin or AT progranulin expression. Importantly, circulating progranulin was independent from adipose tissue gene expression in paired samples. sc AT progranulin expression was higher than in vis AT (P = 0.027), and there was a positive correlation between sc AT and vis AT gene expression (P < 0.001; r = +0.34). Serum progranulin strongly and rapidly increased after BS within 3 days and remained elevated up to 12 months. Serum progranulin was strongly correlated with serum CTRP-3 levels. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides detailed progranulin gene expression data in sc and vis AT in a large, prospective and observational cohort of patients with severe obesity. Serum progranulin concentrations are not predicted by sc or vis AT progranulin gene expression. Thus, AT seems not to be the main source of circulating progranulin levels in obesity.",
