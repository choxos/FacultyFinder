  "title": "A phase 2 PK/PD study of andexanet alfa for reversal of rivaroxaban and edoxaban anticoagulation in healthy volunteers.",
  "abstract": "As with any anticoagulant, factor Xa (FXa) inhibitors are associated with a risk of major bleeding. Andexanet alfa is a recombinant modified human FXa lacking enzymatic activity, developed for reversal of FXa inhibitor-induced anticoagulation. In two phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center studies, different regimens of andexanet alfa were administered to healthy volunteers after therapeutic anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or edoxaban, and multiple anticoagulation reversal and safety end points were evaluated. Andexanet alfa rapidly and effectively reversed anticoagulation with both rivaroxaban and edoxaban. Within 2 minutes after bolus, anti-FXa activity decreased significantly, with maximum decreases of ≈93% (P < .05) and ≈82% (P < .05), respectively, compared with placebo. The stoichiometric ratios of andexanet alfa:total anticoagulant at maximum reversal of anti-FXa activity ranged from 1:1 to 1.3:1 for rivaroxaban and 1.41:1 to 2.58:1 for edoxaban. Sustained normalization of thrombin generation for ≈2 hours and sustained decrease in unbound anticoagulant (maximum ≈80%) for up to ≈4 hours following completion of andexanet alfa administration, compared with placebo, were observed when andexanet was administered as a bolus or as a bolus followed by continuous infusion. Andexanet alfa was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events or thrombotic events. Andexanet alfa has been approved in the United States and Europe for reversal of anticoagulation in patients treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban who experience life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding. These studies were registered with clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT03578146 and #NCT03551743).",
