  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare postoperative corneal endothelial cell density (ECD) loss in eyes undergoing pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), or combination of cataract extraction (using phacoemulsification) and intraocular lens implantation with vitrectomy (CE/IOL-PPV) surgeries. METHODS: Institutional setting. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and ECD by specular microscopy were measured preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively in both groups. Relative postoperative ECD loss was the primary outcome measure. Change in BCVA was the secondary outcome measure. RESULTS: Forty eyes of 40 patients undergoing PPV and 46 eyes of 46 patients undergoing CE/IOL-PPV were included in the final analysis. Postoperative ECD was decreased slightly more in the CE/IOL-PPV group compared with the PPV group (13.9% ± 15.5% vs 9.0% ± 14.6%), although this was not statistically significant (p = 0.10). The improvement in the logMAR BCVA was, however, statistically more significant in the CE/IOL-PPV group compared with the PPV group (-56.6% ± 24.3% vs -38.6% ± 45.5%, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: PPV and the combination CE/IOL-PPV surgeries lead to modest and statistically similar postoperative decline in ECD. The combination surgery may lead to slightly more postoperative cells loss, but also more improvement in visual acuity.",
