  "title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy adjuvant to gabapentin and pregabalin for treatment of SCI-related neuropathic pain.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate if a combination of anticonvulsant and antidepressant, two primary therapies for neuropathic pain, is associated with improved pain control compared to individual therapy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study Setting: The University of Alabama at Birmingham Rehabilitation Center In-patient Program between 2012 and 2015. PARTICIPANTS: Incident SCI cases, 19-65 years of age. OUTCOMES: Bryce-Ragnarsson pain classification scheme and the Numerical Rating Scale Results: Twenty-nine eligible patients completed 6-month follow-up; their average age was 36.4 years, 89% were male, and 65% were white. Baseline characteristics were not different by therapy initiated (combination versus single). At 6 months follow-up, therapy initiated at baseline was not associated with level of pain in the past week (p=0.3145) or past 24 hours (p=0.4107). However, patients who remained on the same therapy reported lower levels of pain 30 minutes after waking (p=0.0235). CONCLUSIONS: The initiation of a combination of anticonvulsant and antidepressant shortly after SCI was not associated with improved pain control at 6 months compared to individual therapy. Adherent patients reported lower levels of pain; further analysis is warranted to elucidate this association.",
