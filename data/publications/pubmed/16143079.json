  "abstract": "AIM: To investigate the in vivo anti-tumor effect of K(8)(C(6)H(11)N(3)O(2))(2)[SiW(9)Ti(3)O(40)] (WT) and the immunological mechanism. METHODS: WT was administrated intragastrically to mice bearing H22 hepatocarcinoma for 10 days and then the tumors were isolated and weighed. MTT colorimetry was used to detect lymphocyte transformation function and cytotoxicity of NK cells. The morphology of apoptotic tumor cells was observed under phase contrast microscope and light microscope after HE staining. The apoptosis rate of BEL-7402 cells treated with WT was detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, WT obviously inhibited the growth of H22 tumor in tumor bearing mice (P<0.05). It enhanced significantly lymphocyte transformation function and cytotoxicity of NK cells (P<0.05). Apoptotic tumor cells were observed under microscope and detected by flow cytometry. CONCLUSION: WT inhibits significantly the growth of tumor by up-regulating the activity of immunocytes and inducing apoptosis of tumor cells.",
