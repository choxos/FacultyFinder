  "title": "The Effects of Cognitive Ability, Mental Health, and Self-Quarantining on Functional Ability of Older Adults During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Results From the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Determine whether levels of anxiety and depression, cognitive ability, and self-quarantining during and prior to the pandemic predict decreases in perceived functional ability. DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal data collected from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) COVID-19 Questionnaire Study (2020) and core CLSA study (Follow-Up 1; 2014-2018). PARTICIPANTS: 17Â 541 CLSA participants. MEASUREMENTS: Self-quarantining behaviours from questionnaires administered at Baseline (April 2020), Monthly, and Exit (December 2020) time points of the CLSA COVID-19 Questionnaire Study, levels of anxiety and depression at Baseline, perceived change in functional ability at Exit, and performance on neuropsychological tests (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task, Mental Alternation Task, Animal Fluency Test) and functional ability (Older Americans Resources and Services [OARS] Multidimensional Assessment Questionnaire) from the core CLSA study. RESULTS: Greater cognitive ability pre-pandemic (B = -.003, P < .01), higher levels of anxiety (B = -.024, P < .01) and depressive symptoms (B = -.110, P < .01) at Baseline, and higher frequency of engaging in self-quarantining throughout the COVID-19 survey period (B = -.098, P < .01) were associated with perceived loss in functional ability at Exit. Self-quarantining behaviour was associated with perceived loss in functional ability only at average and high levels of depressive symptoms (B = -.013, P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with higher cognitive and lower functional ability prior to the pandemic were at greater risk of decreased perceived functional ability during the first year of the pandemic, as were those who experienced greater levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Strategies/interventions to preserve functional ability in older adults with cognitive independence prior to future pandemics are warranted.",
