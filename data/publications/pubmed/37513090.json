  "title": "The Biogenic Synthesis of Bimetallic Ag/ZnO Nanoparticles: A Multifunctional Approach for Methyl Violet Photocatalytic Degradation and the Assessment of Antibacterial, Antioxidant, and Cytotoxicity Properties.",
  "abstract": "In this study, bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) of silver (Ag) and zinc oxide (ZnO) were synthesized using Leptadenia pyrotechnica leaf extract for the first time. Monometallic NPs were also obtained for comparison. The characterization of the prepared NPs was carried out using various techniques, including UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The latter confirmed the crystalline nature and diameter of the monometallic and bimetallic NPs of Ag and ZnO. The SEM images of the prepared NPs revealed their different shapes. The biological activities of the NPs were evaluated concerning their antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic properties. The antibacterial activities were measured using the time-killing method. The results demonstrated that both the monometallic and bimetallic NPs inhibited the growth of Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. The antioxidant activities of the NPs were evaluated using the DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) assay and their cytotoxicity was checked using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The results indicated that the controlled quantity of the monometallic and bimetallic NPs did not affect the viability of the cells. However, the decreased cell (L-929) viability suggested that the NPs could have anticancer properties. Furthermore, the photocatalytic degradation of methyl violet and 4-nitrophenol was investigated using the prepared Ag/ZnO NPs, examining the factors affecting the degradation process and conducting a kinetic and thermodynamic study. The prepared Ag/ZnO NPs demonstrated good photocatalytic degradation (88.9%) of the methyl violet (rate constant of 0.0183 min[-1]) in comparison to 4-nitrophenol (NPh), with a degradation rate of 81.37% and 0.0172 min[-1], respectively. Overall, the bimetallic NPs showed superior antibacterial, antioxidant, cytotoxic, and photocatalytic properties compared to the monometallic NPs of Ag and ZnO.",
