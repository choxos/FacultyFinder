  "abstract": "Predicting individual effects of switching from standard half-life (SHL) to extended half-life (EHL) FVIII/FIX concentrates is pivotal in clinical care, but large-scale individual data are scarce. The aim of this study was to assess individual changes in terminal half-life (THL) after switching to EHL concentrates and identifying determinants of a clinically relevant THL extension in people with severe hemophilia. Data from participants with pharmacokinetic studies on both SHL and EHL were extracted from the Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetics Service (WAPPS) database and stratified according to hemophilia type and age groups (children/adults). A 30% increase in THL was considered clinically relevant. Predictors of a relevant increase were identified using logistic regression. Data from 688 persons with severe hemophilia (2174 infusions) were included: 89% hemophilia A; median age: 21.7 (interquartile range [IQR]: 11.5-37.7); positive inhibitor history: 11.7%. THL increased by 38% (IQR: 17%-67%) and 212% (139%-367%) for hemophilia A and B, respectively. All EHL-FIX concentrate users showed clinically relevant THL extension. However, 40% (242/612) of people with hemophilia A showed limited extension or decrease in THL after switching. Relevant FVIII-THL extension was predicted by short baseline THL and blood group non-O in both children and adults. In conclusion, clinically relevant THL extension was observed in all 75/76 participants switching to EHL-FIX, and in 60% of 612 switching to EHL-FVIII. Short THL on SHL-FVIII and blood group non-O were identified as predictors for a relevant THL increase after switching to EHL-FVIII. Individualized pharmacokinetic assessment may guide clinical decision-making when switching from SHL to EHL-FVIII.",
