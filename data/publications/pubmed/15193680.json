  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of ramipril on left ventricular mass (LVM) and function in vascular disease patients with controlled blood pressure (BP) and with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). BACKGROUND: Increased LVM and left ventricular (LV) volume and decreased LVEF predict clinical events. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors reduce LVM and LV volume and preserve LVEF in patients with hypertension and/or LV dysfunction, but have not been studied in patients with controlled BP and preserved LVEF. METHODS: We compared the effects of two doses of ramipril (10 mg/day and 2.5 mg/day) versus placebo in 506 patients with vascular disease on echocardiographic measures of LVM and LV function. RESULTS: Baseline BP and LVEF were similar, 131/76 mm Hg and 58%, in all treatment groups. After four years, LVM index increased by 3.98 +/- 2.08 g/m2 in the placebo and by 4.16 +/- 1.86 g/m2 in the ramipril 2.5 mg/day groups and decreased by 2.02 +/- 2.25 g/m2 in the ramipril 10 mg/day group (p = 0.02). The changes in LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were 4.16 +/- 2.55 ml and 5.31 +/- 1.67 ml in the placebo, -0.43 +/- 2.75 ml and 2.90 +/- 1.45 ml in the ramipril 2.5 mg/day, and -5.90 +/- 2.93 ml and -1.90 +/- 1.55 ml in the ramipril 10 mg/day groups (p = 0.02 and p = 0.001). The changes in LVEF were -2.02 +/- 0.72%, -1.54 +/- 0.74%, and -0.17 +/- 0.72%, respectively (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ramipril has beneficial effects on LV structure and function in vascular patients with controlled BP and with preserved LVEF.",
