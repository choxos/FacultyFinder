  "title": "Wounds resulting from non-malignant haematological disease: a case series.",
  "abstract": "A proactive and systemic approach is imperative to preventing wounds due to disorders of non-malignant haematologic disease. Here, the authors provide several examples of patients with either a known history or acute diagnosis of a coagulation disorder with the aim of reviewing potential cutaneous injuries as well as diagnosis and treatment. A description of the wound and treatment course along with recommendations where appropriate are presented. The article serves as a general review for health professionals who may encounter patients with this disorder and who are involved in treatment decisions. After reviewing the article, the practitioner will be able to identify cutaneous injuries that may be secondary to an underlying haematological disorder, review the diagnosis and treatment recommended, and understand the need for a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.",
