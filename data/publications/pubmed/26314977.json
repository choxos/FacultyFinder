  "title": "A practical approach to evidence-based dentistry: IX: how to appraise and use an article about economic analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW: In everyday practice, dentists face clinical decisions for which they need to consider both treatment consequences (that is, benefits and harms) and costs. Economic analysis is a study design in which investigators evaluate and compare the costs and consequences of different treatment alternatives within a defined period. A critical appraisal of such studies includes an assessment of the risk of bias, results, and applicability of the study. The authors provide the concepts and guidelines that dentists can apply to critically appraise economic analyses. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Dentists who wish to inform their clinical decisions regarding questions that involve both treatment consequences and costs can use these guidelines to understand the different types of economic analyses and to decide what type of economic analyses to search for, as well as to critically appraise any economic analyses identified.",
