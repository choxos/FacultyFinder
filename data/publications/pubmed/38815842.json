  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease may be an important modifiable risk factor for stroke. AIMS: To determine the contribution of markers of periodontal disease to stroke risk globally, within subpopulations, and by stroke subtypes. METHODS: INTERSTROKE is the largest international case-control study of risk factors for first acute stroke. All participants were asked a standardised set of questions about the presence or absence of painful teeth, painful gums or lost teeth, as markers of periodontal disease, within the previous year. The total number of reported variables was calculated per participant. Multivariable conditional logistic regression examined the association of these variables with acute stroke. RESULTS: In 26901 participants, across 32 countries, there was a significant multivariable association between lost teeth and stroke (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.01 - 1.22), but not painful teeth (OR 1.00, 95 % CI 0.91-1.10) or painful gums (OR 1.01, 95 % CI 0.89 - 1.14). When these symptoms were considered together there was a graded increased odds of stroke, with the largest magnitude of association seen if a patient reported all three of painful teeth, painful gums and lost teeth (OR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.00 - 1.79). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that features of severe periodontal disease are a risk factor for acute stroke. Periodontal disease should be considered as a potentially modifiable risk factor for stroke.",
