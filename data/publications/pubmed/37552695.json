  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The single breath diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) captures several aspects of the role of the lung in meeting the metabolic demands of the body. The magnitude of the independent contributors to the DLCO is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that independently contribute to the DLCO. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to investigate the impact of height, age, sex and haemoglobin on DLCO, alveolar volume (VA) and carbon monoxide transfer coefficient (KCO). METHODS: Study participants were pre-screened based on normal exercise capacity achieved during an incremental cardio-pulmonary exercise testing (CPET) using cycle ergometry at McMaster University Medical Center between 1988-2012. Participants who had an FEV1>80% predicted, with an FEV1/FVC ≥0.7 and who achieved a maximum power output ≥80% were selected for analysis. In total, 16,298 subjects [61% male, mean height 1.70m (range 1.26-2.07), age 49 yrs (10-94), weight 79 kg (23-190) had DLCO measured while demonstrating normal spirometry and exercise capacity. RESULTS: The DLCO increased exponentially with height, was 15% greater in males, increased with age yearly until 20, then decreased yearly after the age of 35, and was 6% higher per gram of haemoglobin (5.58*Height(m)1.69*1.15 in Males*(1-0.006*Age>35)*(1+0.01*Age<20) *(1+0.06*Hb gm/dl), (r = 0.76). CONCLUSION: Height, age, sex, and haemoglobin all have independent influence on the DLCO in subjects with normal spirometry and preserved exercise capacity.",
