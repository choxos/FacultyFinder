  "title": "The Canadian Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy Registry: Rationale, Design, and Preliminary Recruitment.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a complex and clinically heterogeneous arrhythmic condition. Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity are particularly evident in ARVC, making clinical decision-making challenging. METHODS: Pediatric and adult cardiologists, geneticists, genetic counsellors, ethicists, nurses, and qualitative researchers are collaborating to create the Canadian ARVC registry using a web-based clinical database. Biological samples will be banked and systematic analysis will be performed to examine potentially causative mutations, variants, and biomarkers. Outcomes will include syncope, ventricular arrhythmias, defibrillator therapies, heart failure, and mortality. RESULTS: Preliminary recruitment has enrolled 365 participants (aged 42.7 ± 17.1 years; 50% women), including 129 probands and 236 family members. Previous cardiac arrest occurred in 28 (8%) participants, syncope occurred in 43 (12%) participants, and 46% of probands had a family history of sudden death. Overall yield of genetic testing was 36% for a disease-causing mutation and 20% for a variant of unknown significance. Target enrollment is 1000 affected patients and 500 unaffected family member controls over 7 years. The cross-sectional and longitudinal data collected in this manner will allow a robust assessment of the natural history and clinical course of genetic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The Canadian ARVC Registry will create a population-based cohort of patients and their families to inform clinical decisions regarding patients with ARVC.",
