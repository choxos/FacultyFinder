  "title": "Application of the YOLOv11-seg algorithm for AI-based landslide detection and recognition.",
  "abstract": "In recent years, landslides have occurred frequently around the world, resulting in significant casualties and property damage. A notable example occurred in 2014, when a landslide in the Argo region of Afghanistan claimed over 2000 lives, becoming one of the most devastating landslide events in history. The increasing frequency and severity of landslides present significant challenges to geological disaster monitoring, making the development of efficient and accurate detection methods critical for disaster mitigation and prevention. This study proposes an intelligent recognition method for landslides, which is based on the latest deep learning model, YOLOv11-seg, which is designed to address the challenges posed by complex terrains and the diverse characteristics of landslides. Using the Bijie-Landslide dataset, the method optimizes the feature extraction and segmentation modules of YOLOv11-seg, enhancing both the accuracy of landslide boundary detection and the pixel-level segmentation of landslide areas. Compared with traditional methods, YOLOv11-seg performs better in detecting complex boundaries and handling occlusion, demonstrating superior detection accuracy and segmentation quality. During the preprocessing phase, various data augmentation techniques, including mirroring, rotation, and color adjustment, were employed, significantly improving the model's generalization performance and robustness across varying terrains, seasons, and lighting conditions. The experimental results indicate that the YOLOv11-seg model excels in several key performance metrics, such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mAP. Specifically, the F1 score reaches 0.8781 for boundary detection and 0.8114 for segmentation, whereas the mAP for bounding box (B) detection and mask (M) segmentation tasks outperforms traditional methods. These results highlight the high reliability and adaptability of YOLOv11-seg for landslide detection. This research provides new technological support for intelligent landslide monitoring and risk assessment, highlighting its potential in geological disaster monitoring.",
