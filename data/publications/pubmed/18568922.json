  "title": "Costs of remission and recovery using family therapy for adolescent anorexia nervosa: a descriptive report.",
  "abstract": "This paper reports on the costs of overall treatment for a cohort of adolescent patients with AN treated with a similar regimen consisting of inpatient medical stabilization, outpatient family therapy, and psychiatric medications for co-morbid psychiatric conditions. Most of the costs associated with outcome were secondary to medical hospitalization. However, the overall costs per remission varied widely depending on the threshold used. However, compared to costs described for adults with AN, adolescent treatment costs appear to be lower when families are used effectively to aid in treatment.",
