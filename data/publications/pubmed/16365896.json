  "title": "Sharing the diagnostic process in the clinical teaching environment: a case study.",
  "abstract": "Revealing or visualizing the thinking involved in making clinical decisions is a challenge. A case study is presented with a visual implement for sharing the diagnostic process. This technique adapts the Bayesian approach to the case presentation. Pretest probabilities and likelihood ratios are gathered to obtain post-test probabilities of every question considered in a patient. The technique advocates for the judicious use of diagnostic options based on the best evidence available. Clinical decisions, presentation skills, and critical evaluation of the literature are also important elements considered in this method.",
