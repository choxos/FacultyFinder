  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To gain a better understanding of the scope and breadth of factors associated with the B-type natriuretic peptides. DESIGN AND METHODS: Databases were searched from 1989 to February 2005 for primary studies that measured BNP or NT-proBNP for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring treatment. RESULTS: There were 103 factors identified in 72 studies. Most of the cardiac diseases were positively associated with BNP and NT-proBNP concentrations and of the non-cardiac conditions, dyspnea, diabetic nephropathy, and stroke were all associated with higher concentrations. Most biochemical and hematological markers showed positive associations. Factors that assessed heart function showed both positive and negative associations and drug therapy was either negatively associated or had no effect on BNP or BNT-proBNP concentrations. Few studies reported independent associations and of those that did age, female gender, and creatinine concentrations were positively associated with BNP and NT-proBNP. CONCLUSIONS: Various factors were found to be associated with BNP and NT-proBNP.",
