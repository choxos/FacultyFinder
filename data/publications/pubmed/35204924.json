  "title": "The Role of Urotensin-II in Obesity and Metabolic Syndrome in Pediatric Population.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Urotensin-II (U-II) is a short cyclic peptide that is widely recognized as one of the most potent vasoconstrictors. U-II plays a role in the pathophysiology of MS, participating in the development of essential hypertension, insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and a proinflammatory state. METHODS: This study comprised 52 obese children and adolescents with a body mass index (BMI) z score > 2, aged 10 to 18 years. Serum levels of U-II were assessed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay along with other standard biochemical parameters. RESULTS: Elevated serum levels of U-II were recorded in the group of obese subjects with MS when compared with the group of obese subjects without MS (4.99 (8.97-3.16) vs. 4.17 (5.17-2.03) ng/mL, median and IQR, p = 0.026). Furthermore, a subgroup of study subjects with high blood pressure had significantly higher U-II levels in comparison with the normotensive subgroup (4.98 (7.19-3.22) vs. 3.32 (5.06-1.97) ng/mL, p = 0.027), while the subgroup with a positive family history of high blood pressure had significantly higher U-II levels when compared with subjects who had a negative family history of elevated blood pressure (5.06 (6.83-4.45) vs. 3.32 (6.13-2.21) ng/mL, p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first study on the levels of U-II in obese children and adolescents, including a possible link to MS.",
