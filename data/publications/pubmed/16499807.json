  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the status of breast feeding, exclusive breast feeding and other feeding patterns in infants upto 12 months age. DESIGN: Cross- sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Department and Immunization Center, Combined Military Hospital, Multan, from October 2004 to March 2005. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was based on \"current status analysis method\" to eliminate the bias of recall method used in most previous studies. Mothers of 650 infants from 0-12 months of age, attending immunization centre and paediatrics OPD, were interviewed about current feeding patterns and other socioeconomic variables. They were divided in three groups depending upon their monthly income. Living conditions matched with monthly income status in all groups. Month-wise distribution of feeding pattern was determined. Analysis was made about the effect of education of mothers, family income, place and mode of delivery, gender of the baby on exclusive breast feeding, duration of breast feeding and initiation of breast feeding. Statistical analysis of the results was made by application of Parson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: Breast feeding was maintained at high level (more than 88%) throughout infancy. Exclusive breast feeding was also maintained at quite high level (66%) till 4 month age. But later there was a sharp decline to 16% at six months of age. The median duration of exclusive breast feeding was 3 months. Mothers with lesser education and lower family income were more likely to exclusively breast feed (p < 0.001). The time interval between birth and first feed observed was quite desirable (less than 3 hours) in most cases. Only 14% infants received pre-lacteal feeds (ghutti, honey, water etc.), while majority of them (59%) received breast milk. Formula milk was first feed in only 25% cases. Breast milk as first and early feed was observed more in babies born by normal delivery in hospital (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Status of breast feeding, exclusive breast feeding and other feeding practices was quite encouraging and desirable in this study. The factors responsible for these results are comprehensive, free and readily available medical facilities including motivational and preventive services provided to women and children in military hospitals. However, there is still need to improve the figures to achieve internationally set goals.",
