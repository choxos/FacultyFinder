  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Health Technology Assessment (HTA) practitioners recognize the significance of qualitative methodologies that focus on how a technology is feasible, meaningfulness, acceptable, and equitable. This mapping aimed to delineate the frameworks employed to synthesize qualitative evidence and assess the quality of synthesis in HTA . METHODS: Mapping was conducted using Medline, LILACS, CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, JBI, and ScienceDirect databases. Gray literature searches included PROQUEST, Open Grey, Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health's Grey Matters, Google Scholar, and HTA agency websites. The inclusion criteria were centered on global qualitative evidence synthesis frameworks. The data are presented in the tables. RESULTS: Of the 2054 articles, 31 were included, mostly from Europe. Guide was the type of document more cited, and most authors are from HTA agencies and universities. Incorporating both patient and family perspectives is the most cited reason for include qualitative evidence. Regardless of the framework or tool, SPICE was the main acronym, and RETREAT was preferred for approach selection. Thematic synthesis dominated analytic methods, and CASP was the primary quality appraisal tool. GRADE-CERQual graded evidence synthesis, with ENTREQ as the top reporting guidance. The GRADE evidence-to-decision framework was mentioned for recommendations. CONCLUSION: This mapping highlights the movement incorporate qualitative evidence in HTA employing specific frameworks. Despite the similarities among documents, most of them describe part of the process to synthesize qualitative evidence. Standardizing procedures to incorporate qualitative evidence into HTA can enhance decision-making. These findings offer essential considerations for HTA practice.",
