  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To evaluate the translations, cross-cultural adaptation procedures and measurement properties of the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff Index (WORC), when it is adapted for different cultures. METHODS: A systematic review was performed, considering different cultural adaptions of the WORC accessible through MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and/or Google Scholar. Included were prospective cohort studies that used an adapted version of the WORC to measure QoL in patients with rotator cuff disorders. All studies were evaluated according to the current guidelines for cross-cultural adaptations and measurement properties. RESULTS: The search retrieved 14 studies that met the inclusion criteria. According to the recommended guidelines for cross-cultural adaptations, 8 studies performed 100% of the steps, 2 studies performed 80% of the steps and 4 studies used previously translated measures. When evaluating the studies' psychometric properties based on the quality criteria, none of the studies reported all recommended measurement properties. All of the studies reported the measurement property of reliability, but none of the studies reported agreement. Internal consistency was fully reported by 15% of studies. Construct validity was reported by 43% of studies. Only one study reported 100% of the cross-cultural adaption guidelines and 83% of the quality criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although the majority of studies demonstrated proper adaptation procedures, testing of the measurement properties were inadequate. It is recommended that the current adapted versions of the WORC undergo further testing before use in clinical practise, and researchers continue to adapt the WORC for different cultures as it proves to be an appropriate instrument for assessing rotator cuff pathology.",
