  "title": "Historical analysis of the diagnosis and management of femoroacetabular impingement prior to the year 2000: a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This systematic review aims to assess the diagnosis, indications and treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) prior to the year 2000 and to determine if historical concepts remain applicable today. PUBMED, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for literature evaluating the diagnosis/treatment of FAI prior to 2000. Cadaver/non-human, non-English and review studies were excluded. Quality assessment was performed using the Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies. Nine studies comprising 307 patients [315 hips; mean age of 32.6 Â± 2.4 years (range, 12-58)] were included. Patients reported groin pain. Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRA; n = 76) and the anterior impingement test (AIT) (n = 88) were used to diagnose impingement. Surgical dislocation with a trochanteric flip osteotomy (n = 237) and Bernese periacetabular osteotomy (n = 40) were common treatments. Pain and range of motion improved for patients. Overall complication rate was 35% (n = 99), with heterotopic ossification (n = 79) most commonly reported. Prior to 2000, there was low quantity and quality of research on the diagnosis/management of FAI. Diagnostic evaluation was primarily through clinical examination (i.e. groin pain and AIT). MRA was occasionally used to detect labral degeneration; however, utilization of computed tomography (CT) and diagnostic injections were not reported. Surgical dislocation and osteotomies of the acetabulum yielded desirable short-term clinical outcomes with a moderate complication rate. No study reported using arthroscopy for FAI management prior to 2000. Clinicians today can learn from historical principles (i.e. clinical diagnosis of FAI, management with surgical correction of femoral head-neck offset) while applying novel techniques (i.e. CT, injections, arthroscopic surgical techniques and rehabilitation) to improve patient outcomes. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV (systematic review of III and IV evidence).",
