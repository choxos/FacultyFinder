  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective is to explore the nursing methods of evidence-based nursing in preventing serious complications in patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension. METHODS: A total of 80 patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension from April 2020 to April 2022 were selected and randomly divided into a control group and a research group, with 40 cases in each group. The blood pressure, Self-Efficacy Scale score, Disease Uncertainty Scale score, the incidence of maternal and infant complications, the improvement of mental state, and the patients' satisfaction with the nursing program were observed and compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with before the intervention, the self-efficacy scores of the two groups were significantly improved, and the blood pressure, disease uncertainty score, SAS, and SDS scores were significantly decreased, and the indicators in the study group were better than those before the intervention. In the control group, the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). After the intervention, among the 40 patients in the study group, 10 cases (25.00%) of cesarean section were significantly lower than 19 cases (47.50%) in the control group, and the nursing work satisfaction in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The application of evidence-based nursing interventions and smart medical nursing interventions to patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension syndrome has significant effect and can effectively improve the blood pressure control effect of patients during pregnancy.",
