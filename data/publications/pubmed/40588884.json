  "title": "Progressive Release of Informational Materials for People Living with Dementia and Their Informal Carers.",
  "abstract": "We describe a process for selecting informational material for people living with dementia that is most appropriate for their stage of dementia. This material provides information on the disease, on ways of living with the disease, and on activities that may delay the progression of the disease, with a view to maintaining an individual's independent living at home. Informational material is suggested according to both an individual's overall clinical disease progression and progression along seven cognitive domain axes that contribute to the overall progression, for example 'working memory' performance or 'attention', with scores for these axes being derived from clinical judgement, from fixed and wearable sensors, or from performance when interacting with devices. Material is rated according to relevance to overall disease progression and relevance to each of the seven axes. For example, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland 'Living Day To Day' document is most relevant to those diagnosed with early dementia onwards, but may also have useful information for those without a dementia diagnosis but are experiencing problems with their working memory or attention.",
