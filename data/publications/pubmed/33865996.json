  "abstract": "BACKGROUNDS: To systematically review the effectiveness and harm of consolidation or maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed stage II-IV EOC. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and PROSPERO databases, and four relevant conferences were systematically searched. We adhered to PRISMA guidelines, and used the GRADE approach to aggregate data. RESULTS: Among 12,675 citations, 28 comprising 16,310 patients were analyzed. The certainty of aggregated study evidence ranged from high to low. CONCLUSIONS: The existing evidence does not find overall survival benefit for consolidation therapy with chemotherapy. For maintenance therapy, comparing with placebo, olaparib, niraparib, veliparib, and bevacizumab are effective as maintenance therapy for certain patients with newly diagnosed stage III-IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma respectively without reducing quality of life. Longer follow-up with more mature results of overall survival will better define the effect of these agents.",
