  "title": "Transplant Recipient Preferences Regarding Organ Donor Research: Their Role in Consent and use of Their Data.",
  "abstract": "Research on deceased organ donors has been hindered by concerns related to seeking research consent from transplant recipients. We undertook this qualitative study to elucidate solid organ transplant recipients views on organ donor research, their role in the consent for such research, and their preferences related to providing their data. We conducted interviews with 18 participants and three themes emerged from the data. The first centered around participant research literacy. The second described practical preferences of participating in research, and the third related to the connection between donor and recipient. We concluded that previously held views about the requirement for transplant recipients to have a consenting role in donor research is not always suitable.",
