  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and wellness programming preferences of cancer survivors from Acres Homes, a historically Black neighborhood in Houston, Texas, with areas of persistent poverty. The goal of this study was to identify opportunities to increase cancer survivor utilization of healthy eating and active living interventions aligned to cancer center community outreach and engagement efforts. METHODS: This multiple methods study included a retrospective review of electronic health record data (n = 413) and qualitative interviews with cancer survivors (n = 31) immediately preceding initiation of healthy eating, active living programming in Acres Homes. RESULTS: This study found Acres Homes survivors have high rates of co-occurrent cardiometabolic disease including obesity (45.0%), diabetes (30.8%), and other related risk factors as well as treatment-related symptoms. Four major concepts emerged from interviews: (1) Factors that influence survivors' ability to eat well and exercise, (2) Current usage of community resources, (3) Interest in relevant programming, and (4) Specific programming preferences. Opportunities for current and future health promotion programming for cancer survivors were explored. CONCLUSION: Strategically tailoring community resources for cancer survivors can provide a more robust network of support to promote healthy eating and active living in this population. This work informed community implementation of evidence-based health interventions in Acres Homes and may support future projects aiming to enhance community-led cancer prevention efforts in historically underserved communities.",
