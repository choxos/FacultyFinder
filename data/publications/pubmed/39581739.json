  "title": "Tushirikiane-4-Uthabiti (Supporting Each Other For Resilience): study protocol of a mental health, HIV self-testing and livelihoods randomised controlled trial for advancing HIV prevention outcomes among urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research with urban refugee youth in Uganda has documented co-occurring social (e.g., poverty) and health (e.g., depression) disparities associated with HIV vulnerabilities. Benefits of HIV self-testing (HIVST) in increasing HIV testing uptake among youth are well established, yet limited interventions have examined if combining HIVST with mental health promotion, or with mental health promotion alongside poverty reduction, is associated with greater improvements in HIV prevention and testing outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of: (1) HIVST alone (standard of care); (2) mobile health (mHealth) and graphic medicine (comic) programme for mental health alongside HIVST; and (3) the combination of HIVST, a livelihoods programme, and mHealth mental health programme, in advancing the primary outcome of HIV testing uptake and secondary outcomes (HIV status knowledge, linkage to confirmatory testing and HIV care, HIV knowledge, consistent condom use, condom use self-efficacy, sexual risk) with urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. A three-arm randomised controlled trial will be implemented from 8 April 2024 to 31 October 2024 with youth across five informal settlements in Kampala, grouped into three sites based on proximity, and randomised in a 1:1:1 design. Approximately 330 participants (110 per arm) are enrolled and data collection will occur at three time points (baseline enrolment, 3-month follow-up and 6-month follow-up). ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study received ethical approval from the University of Toronto (#37496), Mildmay Uganda Research Ethics Committee (#MUREC-2021-41) and Uganda National Council for Science & Technology (#SS1021ES). The trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06270160). Study findings will produce new knowledge of the impacts of a mental health programme, and a combined mental health and livelihoods programme, on improving HIV prevention outcomes among urban refugee youth in Kampala. Findings will be shared in peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and in community dissemination. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06270160 (date of registration: 13 February 2024).
