  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Older age (> 60) has been considered a relative contraindication for bariatric surgery due to increased complication risk. This study examined the risks and benefits of bariatric surgery for patients older than 60 years in Canadian population. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of the Ontario Bariatric Registry: a database recording peri-operative and post-operative outcomes of publicly funded bariatric surgeries across the province. Patients who completed 1 year follow-up, who underwent laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB) or laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) between January 2010 and May 2013, were divided into older (> 60) and younger (> 60) cohorts, and outcomes were compared. RESULTS: Between January 2010 and May 2013, 3166 registry patients underwent LRYGB or LSG and completed 1-year follow-up. Of these, 204 (6.5%) were older than 60 years, with 175 (85.8%) undergoing LRYGB and 29 (14.2%) LSG. Demographics were similar, except for a higher number of males in the older group (59 (28.9%) versus 452 (15.3%) (p < 0.001)). No significant difference in complication rate was noted (15% for younger cohort versus 13.8% (p = 0.889)). The average percentage of excess weight loss was significantly higher in the younger population (60.72% versus 56.25% (p < 0.05)) overall, however not significantly in the LSG group. Reduction in medication use post-surgery for management of co-morbidities was significantly higher in the older patients (- 0.91 versus - 2.03 (p < 0.001)). CONCLUSION: The older cohort who underwent LRYGB or LSG was at no greater risk for intra-operative and post-operative complications and showed greater reduction in medication use post-surgery when compared to the younger cohort.",
