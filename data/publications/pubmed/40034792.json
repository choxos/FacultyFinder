  "title": "Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomic trajectories reveal dynamic regulation of inflammatory actors in delirium.",
  "abstract": "Delirium is a neurologic syndrome characterized by inattention and cognitive impairment frequently encountered in the medically ill. Peripheral inflammation is a key trigger of delirium, but the patient-specific immune responses associated with delirium development and resolution are unknown. This retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected biospecimens examines RNA sequencing from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of adults hospitalized for COVID-19 to better understand patient-specific factors associated with delirium (n = 64). Longitudinal transcriptomic analyses highlight persistent immune dysregulation in delirium, marked by increasing expression trajectories of genes linked to innate immune pathways, including complement activation, cytokine production, and monocyte/macrophage recruitment. Genes involved adaptive immunity showed a declining trajectory over time in patients with delirium. Although corticosteroid treatment suppressed some aspects of immune hyperactivation, aberrant responses contributing to delirium were exacerbated. Delirium resolution was characterized by normalization of key transcripts such as CCL2 and innate immune markers. Novel associations with delirium were found in genes related to stress granule assembly and DUSP2 and KLF10, which mediate T-cell responses. These findings provide insights into the peripheral immune responses accompanying delirium and their modulation by corticosteroids. Future trials targeting aberrant inflammatory responses may mitigate the severe outcomes associated with delirium due to COVID19.",
