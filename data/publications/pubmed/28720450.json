  "title": "Detection of cervical precancerous lesions with Aptima HPV assays using SurePath preservative fluid specimens.",
  "abstract": "SurePath specimens from women referred to colposcopy were treated with Aptima Transfer Solution (ATS) before testing in Aptima HPV (AHPV) and Aptima HPV 16, 18/45 (AHPV-GT) assays. Untreated SurePath specimens were tested with the cobas HPV test. PreservCyt specimens were assessed for cytology and tested with AHPV. High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions served as the reference standard. Excellent agreement (95.5%; k=0.91) was observed for ATS-treated SurePath specimens between Tigris and Panther systems and between the PreservCyt and ATS-treated SurePath specimens (91.1%, k=0.81) with the AHPV assay on Tigris. Agreement between the AHPV and cobas assays with SurePath specimens was substantial (89.9%, k=0.80). AHPV sensitivity for CIN2+(n=147) was 91.2% for SurePath and PreservCyt. Cobas HPV sensitivity was 93.9% for SurePath specimens. AHPV testing of SurePath specimens was more specific (59.4%) than cobas (54.7%) (p<0.001). Detection and genotyping showed similar absolute and relative risks. ATS-treated SurePath specimens tested with AHPV and AHPV-GT assays showed similar performance with greater specificity than cobas HPV on SurePath specimens. Similar overall results were seen using a CIN3 disease endpoint.",
