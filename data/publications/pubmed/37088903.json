  "title": "Assessing a Virtual Education Intervention for Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: A Qualitative Study of Patient Perceptions.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Authors of studies of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have identified several knowledge gaps and misconceptions regarding the condition and its management. The COVID-19 pandemic heightened isolation of patients and underscored the need for education and knowledge building in order for patients to effectively manage AF during times of increased health risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess, using a qualitative approach, the experiences and perceived benefits of patients with AF regarding an 8-session virtual education intervention (AF-at-Home) during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A qualitative study with 3 focus groups using a semistructured focus group guide was conducted and recorded online with the same trained moderator. RESULTS: We identified 7 primary themes emerging from patients' experiences: (1) building knowledge beyond information available in clinic visits, (2) managing anxiety, (3) generating self-efficacy, (4) providing social comparison, (5) perceived benefits of both experiential and informational content, (6) facilitating self-management behaviors, and (7) facilitating communication with providers. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of the focus groups shows the benefits of a virtual education program in building knowledge, skills, and self-efficacy as well as reducing anxiety and normalizing one's experience by attending a program alongside other patients with AF.",
