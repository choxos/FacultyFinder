  "title": "Media analysis of early dissemination of Canadian child maltreatment surveillance data.",
  "abstract": "A media strategy was developed to disseminate Canadian child maltreatment surveillance data. Print media were systematically searched and 29 articles reporting on the data were retrieved. Using content analysis, the articles were analyzed to assess informational accuracy and to understand how the media framed the issue of maltreatment. This analysis permits the authors to share \"lessons learned,\" which will be helpful for researchers disseminating child maltreatment data through the media.",
