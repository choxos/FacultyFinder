  "title": "Effect of Eucommia ulmoides on systolic blood pressure in the spontaneous hypertensive rat.",
  "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to establish the safety and efficacy of Eucommia ulmoides (Du-Zhong) extract in the treatment of hypertension. Pilot experiments using rats demonstrated that E. ulmoides extract was safe to the saturation limits of the compound. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was 1200 mg/kg when administered by gastric gavage at a concentration of 1200 mg/ml. Also, rats given 200 mg/kg, 600 mg/kg or 1200 mg/kg doses of E. ulmoides extract daily for 28 days demonstrated no evidence of acute toxicity as determined by clinical appearance, histopathology and serum chemistry evaluation. Lastly, spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) were administered E. ulmoides extract daily for 22 days. Systolic blood pressure (BP) was measured on treatment days 1, 8, 15 and 22 at 0, 1, 2 and 3 hours post-treatment. Beginning on day 8, E. ulmoides extract administered at the mid or high dosages lowered BP in male, but not female, rats. BP declined at a rate of approximately 10 mmHg per hour. The mid dosage of 600 mg/kg was found to be the minimum effective dose. In conclusion, E. ulmoides extract was non-toxic and effective in reducing systolic BP in the SHR.",
