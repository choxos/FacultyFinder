  "title": "ncRNAs and their impact on dopaminergic neurons: Autophagy pathways in Parkinson's disease.",
  "abstract": "Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a complex neurological illness that causes severe motor and non-motor symptoms due to a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The aetiology of PD is influenced by a variety of genetic, environmental, and cellular variables. One important aspect of this pathophysiology is autophagy, a crucial cellular homeostasis process that breaks down and recycles cytoplasmic components. Recent advances in genomic technologies have unravelled a significant impact of ncRNAs on the regulation of autophagy pathways, thereby implicating their roles in PD onset and progression. They are members of a family of RNAs that include miRNAs, circRNA and lncRNAs that have been shown to play novel pleiotropic functions in the pathogenesis of PD by modulating the expression of genes linked to autophagic activities and dopaminergic neuron survival. This review aims to integrate the current genetic paradigms with the therapeutic prospect of autophagy-associated ncRNAs in PD. By synthesizing the findings of recent genetic studies, we underscore the importance of ncRNAs in the regulation of autophagy, how they are dysregulated in PD, and how they represent novel dimensions for therapeutic intervention. The therapeutic promise of targeting ncRNAs in PD is discussed, including the barriers that need to be overcome and future directions that must be embraced to funnel these ncRNA molecules for the treatment and management of PD.",
