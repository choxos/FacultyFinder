  "title": "Insulin therapy in acute coronary syndromes: an appraisal of completed and ongoing randomised trials with important clinical end points.",
  "abstract": "Insulin therapy was first proposed as an adjunctive therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) in the 1960s. Since then, numerous randomised clinical trials have been conducted to determine the efficacy and to define the role of insulin therapy in ACS. This review will discuss: 1) completed trials of insulin therapy in ACS, including both glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) approaches and non-GIK approaches; 2) trials of insulin therapy in critically ill non-ACS patients and the lessons from these trials that can be applied to trials of insulin in ACS patients; and 3) a summary of ongoing and planned trials of insulin in ACS patients.",
