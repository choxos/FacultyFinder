  "title": "How safe is kitesurfing? A review of orthopaedic kitesurfing injuries.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This narrative review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of injuries arising from kitesurfing. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of articles from the last 20 years relating to kitesurfing orthopaedic injuries. Two of the authors independently conducted a systematic search of Pubmed (Medline), Embase, NHS Library and Knowledge Hub, TRIP, and Google Scholar: ultimately, after exclusions, the report analysed 25 articles. DISCUSSION: Kitesurfing is associated with a high incidence of lower limb injuries in which protective gear is uncommon. Furthermore, a lack of educational initiatives and specified strength training may compound this risk. CONCLUSION: Notably, there is a lack of prospective evidence documenting traumatic injury. Addressing this gap is a potential next step, to enhance our understanding of injury patterns and preventative measures. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN: Common kitesurfing injuries include those to the foot, ankle, and knee, typically resulting from falls or collisions with the board or water. While the majority of injuries are relatively mild, more significant injuries such as ACL rupture, PCL rupture, and polytrauma have also been reported. What are the new findings: This systematic review confirmed that the majority of injuries occur below the knee (average 50%). Injuries of the chest (average 8.5%) and head (average 10.8%) also make up a significant proportion of injuries sustained. Although the majority of injuries in kitesurfing are minor, due to the high forces typically involved, there is the potential for catastrophic injury including; neurological, internal bleeding, polytrauma and death.",
