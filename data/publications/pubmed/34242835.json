  "title": "Comparison of Alinity m HPV and cobas HPV assays on cervical specimens in diverse storage media.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the concordance of high-risk HPV (HR-HPV) testing with the Alinity assay on cervical samples collected with diverse collection/storage protocols (ThinPrep, SurePath, Cervicollect) and to assess inter-assay concordance of HR-HPV testing of cervical cell specimens with Alinity m HR HPV assay (Alinity) vs cobas® 4800 HPV assay (cobas). METHODS: Specimens were obtained from 560 women attending a Women's Health clinic. Two specimens were obtained from each woman with combinations of two of the three collection devices and aliquots were tested by the two assays. RESULTS: Alinity showed an agreement of 93.9%, Kappa = 0.89 (263/280) between ThinPrep and SurePath specimens; 97.5%, Kappa = 0.95 (347/356) and 92.9%, Kappa = 0.85 (104/112) between ThinPrep and SurePath aliquots taken before or after cytology processing, respectively. Cervi-Collect specimens showed an agreement of 94.6%, Kappa = 0.89 (265/280) with ThinPrep specimens. Compared to cobas, Alinity showed agreements of 94.3%, Kappa = 0.88 (395/419) and 91.8%, Kappa = 0.82 (257/280) between ThinPrep and SurePath specimens, respectively. Alinity and cobas detected genotypes 16/18 and other high-risk HPV types at similar rates and showed similar correlations with cytology grades. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to cobas, Alinity performed equally well for detecting HPV in cervical specimens obtained with ThinPrep and SurePath. The Cervi-Collect device compared well to the other collection methods. Alinity is a reliable assay for simultaneous detection of HPV-16/18 and other high-risk genotypes in cervical specimens.",
