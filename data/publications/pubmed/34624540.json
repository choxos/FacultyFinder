  "title": "Translating Evidence to Optimize Patient Care Using GRADE.",
  "abstract": "Optimal evidence-based clinical practice requires systematic summaries of the best available evidence, including ratings of the quality of that evidence, and is facilitated by the availability of trustworthy guidelines. In this review, we describe the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rating quality of evidence and moving from evidence to recommendations using examples from allergy-immunology. GRADE focuses on systematic summaries of the best evidence, systematic reviews and trustworthy guidelines, and emphasizes a structured approach to determining quality (certainty) of bodies of evidence, absolute magnitude of effects of desirable and undesirable consequences (benefits and harms), and use of evidence to develop clinical recommendations. Adopted by over 110 organizations worldwide, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology/American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, GRADE is foundational to the optimal interpretation of research evidence and its application in clinical practice. This review supports the clinician's ability to find and use the information in GRADE guidelines to help care for patients in the clinic.",
