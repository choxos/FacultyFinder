  "title": "A kinome drug screen identifies multi-TKI synergies and ERBB2 signaling as a therapeutic vulnerability in MYC/TYR subgroup atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare, devastating, and largely incurable pediatric brain tumor. Although recent studies have uncovered 3 molecular subgroups of ATRTs with distinct disease patterns, and signaling features, the therapeutic profiles of ATRT subgroups remain incompletely elucidated. METHODS: We examined the effect of 465 kinase inhibitors on a panel of ATRT subgroup-specific cell lines. We then applied multiomics analyses to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of kinase inhibitor efficacy in ATRT subgroups. RESULTS: We observed that ATRT cell lines are broadly sensitive to inhibitors of the PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways, as well as CDKs, AURKA/B kinases, and polo-like kinase 1. We identified 2 classes of multikinase inhibitors predominantly targeting receptor tyrosine kinases including PDGFR and EGFR/ERBB2 in MYC/TYR ATRT cells. The PDGFRB inhibitor, Dasatinib, synergistically affected MYC/TYR ATRT cell growth when combined with broad-acting PI3K and MAPK pathway inhibitors, including Rapamycin and Trametinib. We observed that MYC/TYR ATRT cells were also distinctly sensitive to various inhibitors of ERBB2 signaling. Transcriptional, H3K27Ac ChIPSeq, ATACSeq, and HiChIP analyses of primary MYC/TYR ATRTs revealed ERBB2 expression, which correlated with differential methylation and activation of a distinct enhancer element by DNA looping. Significantly, we show the brain penetrant EGFR/ERBB2 inhibitor, Afatinib, specifically inhibited in vitro and in vivo growth of MYC/TYR ATRT cells. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our studies suggest combined treatments with PDGFR and ERBB2-directed TKIs with inhibitors of the PI3K and MAPK pathways as an important new therapeutic strategy for the MYC/TYR subgroup of ATRTs.",
