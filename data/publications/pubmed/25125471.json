  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Results of cost-of-illness studies in dementia have shown a considerable divergence in costs of medication for persons with dementia. However, detailed economic analyses of medication costs for community-dwelling persons with dementia are currently still missing, especially on the basis of primary data. OBJECTIVE: To determine medication cost, cost per drug, and number of drugs taken of community-dwelling persons with dementia and analyze their associated factors; to estimate the current price reduction of anti-dementia drugs due to implementation of low-priced generics. METHOD: The present analysis included 205 patients screened positive for dementia. Medication data were assessed within a medication review. To estimate the cost effect of implementing generics, the most favorable equivalent generic was assigned to each anti-dementia drug. Factors associated with medication cost, cost per drug, and number of drugs taken were evaluated using multiple regression models. RESULTS: Medication cost and cost per drug were higher and the number of taken drugs lower in advanced stages of cognitive impairment. Prescription of anti-dementia generics could decrease overall medication cost by 28%. Medication cost was associated with number of diagnoses, deficits in activities of daily living, and age. Dementia severity was related to cost per drug and number of drugs taken. CONCLUSION: Medication cost increases with the number of diagnoses and growing deficits in activities of daily living and decreases with age. Severely cognitively impaired persons are treated with a small number of high-priced drugs, which could suggest inadequate medication of multimorbid persons.",
