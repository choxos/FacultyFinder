  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of nursing discharge instructions on post-discharge care management in heart failure patients. METHODS: The quasi- experimental non-randomized study was conducted at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, from January to December 2017, and comprised in-patients suffering from heart failure. They were divided into two equal groups. In the intervention group, discharge instructions and written material was thoroughly given by the nurses other than routine existing instructions for effective post-discharge care management. The control group received discharged instructions under existing routine. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients, there were 40(50%) in each group with no significant difference in terms of age, gender and education (p>0.05 each). Regarding awareness and control of the disease, adherence with medication and proper management of their illness, the intervention group had higher level of competency than the control group (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of nursing interventions to educate the patient of heart failure during hospitalisation, on discharge, follow-up day and continuous guidance on telephone significantly improved the post-discharge care management of the patients.",
