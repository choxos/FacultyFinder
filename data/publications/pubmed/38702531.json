  "title": "Effects of different light conditions on morphological, anatomical, photosynthetic and biochemical parameters of Cypripedium macranthos Sw.",
  "abstract": "In this study, the morphological (plant height, leaf length and width, stem diameter and leaf number), anatomical (epidermal cell density and thickness, Stomatal length and width), photosynthetic (net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, relative humidity, leaf temperature and chlorophyll fluorescence parameters) and biochemical parameters (the content of soluble sugar, soluble protein, proline, malondialdehyde and electrical conductivity) of Cypripedium macranthos Sw. in Changbai Mountain were determined under different light conditions (L10, L30, L50, L100). The results showed that morphological values including plant height, leaf area, stem diameter and leaf number of C. macranthos were smaller under the condition of full light at L100. The epidermal cell density and epidermal thickness of C. macranthos were the highest under L30 and L50 treatments, respectively. It had the highest net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and chlorophyll content under L50 treatment. Meanwhile, correlation analysis indicated that photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and water use efficiency (WUE) were the main factors influencing Pn. C. macranthos accumulated more soluble sugars and soluble proteins under L100 treatment, while the degree of membrane peroxidation was the highest and the plant was severely damaged. In summary, the adaptability of C. macranthos to light conditions is ranked as follows L50 > L30 > L10 > L100. Appropriate light conditions for C. macranthos are 30%-50% of full light, which should be taken into account in protection and cultivation.",
