  "title": "Challenges facing standardised patients representing equity-deserving groups: Insights from health care educators.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health professions training programmes increasingly rely on standardised patient (SP) programmes to integrate equity-deserving groups into learning and assessment opportunities. However, little is known about the optimal approach, and many SP programmes struggle to meet these growing needs. This study explored insights from health care educators working with SP programmes to deliver curricular content around equity-deserving groups. METHODS: We interviewed 14 key informants in 2021 who were involved in creating or managing SP-based education. Verbatim transcripts were analysed in an iterative coding process, anchored by qualitative content analysis methodology and informed by two theoretical frameworks: sociologic translation and simulation design. Repeated cycles of data collection and analyses continued until themes could be constructed, aligned with existing theories and grounded in empirical data, with sufficient relevance and robustness to inform educators and curricular leads. RESULTS: Three themes were constructed: (i) creating safety for SPs paid to be vulnerable, (ii) fidelity as an issue broader than who plays the role and (iii) engaging equity-deserving groups. SP work involving traditionally marginalised groups risk re-traumatization, highlighting the importance of (i) informed consent in recruiting SPs, (ii) separating role portrayal from lived experiences, (iii) adequately preparing learners and facilitators, (iv) creating time-outs and escapes for SPs and (v) building opportunity for de-roling with community support. CONCLUSIONS: SP programmes are well positioned to be allies and advocates to equity-deserving groups and to collaborate and share governance of the educational development process from its outset. SP programmes can support the delivery of curricular content around equity-deserving groups by advocating with curricular leadership, building relationships with community partners, facilitating co-creation and co-delivery of educational content and building safety into simulation.",
