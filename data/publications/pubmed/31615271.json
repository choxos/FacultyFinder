  "title": "90-90-90 for everyone?: Access to HIV care and treatment for people with HIV who experience imprisonment in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "We examined HIV care and treatment in prison and after release for people with HIV in Ontario, Canada, and compared HIV care and treatment with the general population. We used administrative data to identify people with HIV released from provincial prison in 2010 and in the general population. We calculated the proportion of people with HIV who accessed HIV care in prison. We compared HIV care use between people with HIV on prison release and in the general population. We estimated the proportion of people with HIV on antiretroviral therapy in prison as the ratio of the average numbers of people prescribed antiretroviral therapy in prison in 2009/2010 and people with HIV in prison in January 2010. We compared the proportion of people with HIV on public drug benefits that filled an antiretroviral therapy prescription within 6 months for people postrelease and in the general population. Of 344 people with HIV on prison admission, 34.0% received HIV care in prison. Over 1 year, 63.6% of 330 people with HIV on prison release and 67.7% of 15,819 people with HIV in the general population accessed HIV care (p = 0.118), and 43.3% of people with HIV on prison release and 55.2% of people with HIV in the general population had 2 or more HIV care visits (p < 0.001). In prison, 52.4% of people with HIV (39.5/75.4) were on antiretroviral therapy. Of those accessing drug benefits, 60.1% of 226 people with HIV on prison release and 79.6% of 7458 people with HIV in the general population claimed an antiretroviral therapy prescription within 6 months (p < 0.001). Access to HIV care and treatment were suboptimal in prison, and sustained HIV care and treatment were worse for people post-release compared to the general population. Interventions are needed to support HIV care for this population.",
