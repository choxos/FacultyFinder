  "title": "Complex Patterns of Antihypertensive Treatment Changes in Long-Term Care Residents.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Antihypertensive treatment changes are common in long-term care residents, yet data on the frequency and predictors of changes are lacking. We described the patterns of antihypertensive changes and examined the triggering factors. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A total of 24,870 Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) nursing home residents aged ≥65 years with long-term stays (≥180 days) from 2006 to 2019. METHODS: We obtained data from the VA Corporate Data Warehouse. Based on Bar Code Medication Administration medication data, we defined 2 types of change events in 180 days of admission: deprescribing (reduced number of antihypertensives or dose reduction of ≥30% compared with the previous week and maintained for at least 2 weeks) and intensification (opposite of deprescribing). Mortality was identified within 2 years after admission. RESULTS: More than 85% of residents were prescribed antihypertensives and 68% of them experienced ≥1 change event during the first 6 months of the nursing home stay. We categorized residents into 10 distinct patterns: no change (27%), 1 deprescribing (11%), multiple deprescribing (5%), 1 intensification (10%), multiple intensification (7%), 1 deprescribing followed by 1 intensification (3%), 1 intensification followed by 1 deprescribing (4%), 3 changes with mixed events (7%), >3 changes with mixed events (10%), and no antihypertensive use (15%). Treatment changes were more frequent in residents with better physical function and/or cognitive function. Potentially triggering factors differed by the type of antihypertensive change: incident high blood pressure and cardiovascular events were associated with intensification, and low blood pressure, weight loss, and falls were associated with deprescribing. Death occurred in 7881 (32%) residents over 2 years. The highest mortality was for those without antihypertensive medication (incidence = 344/1000 person-years). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Patterns of medication changes existing in long-term care residents are complex. Future studies should explore the benefits and harms of these antihypertensive treatment changes.",
