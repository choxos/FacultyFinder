  "abstract": "Several studies have reported that cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of mucinous ovarian cancer, but other studies have failed to find such a relation. Using data from the Case-Control Surveillance Study, begun in four US cities in 1976, the authors conducted a case-control study (1976-2001) to examine the association between cigarette smoking and the risk of ovarian cancer of different cell types. Among 709 incident cases of epithelial ovarian cancer, 402 were serous, 74 were mucinous, 106 were endometrioid, and 127 were of other cell types. For mucinous ovarian cancer, the odds ratios were 1.5 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.7, 3.4) among women who smoked less than one pack of cigarettes per day, 1.4 (95% CI: 0.6, 3.5) among women who smoked one pack per day, and 2.9 (95% CI: 1.2, 7.5) among women who smoked more than one pack per day, relative to never smokers. The odds ratios were 2.5 (95% CI: 1.1, 5.4) for ex-smokers and 1.4 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.9) for current smokers. While women with up to 15 pack-years of smoking had an almost 2.5 times' increased risk of mucinous ovarian cancer, such an increased risk was not found among those with more than 15 pack-years of smoking. There was no association between cigarette smoking and epithelial ovarian cancer of other cell types. Despite inconsistencies in the data, these results strengthen the evidence that cigarette smoking may play a role in the development of mucinous ovarian cancer but not ovarian cancer of other cell types.",
