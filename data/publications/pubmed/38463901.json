  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been dramatic reduction in Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib) since introduction of Hib vaccines, but children still experience serious invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) disease caused by various serotype and non-typeable bacteria. The object of this study was to describe the serotype distribution and clinical spectrum of Hi bacteremia in children admitted to Canadian hospitals. METHODS: All children with Hi bacteremia admitted 2013 through 2017 to 10 centres across Canada were included. Demographic, clinical, treatment and outcome data were collected. RESULTS: Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia occurred in 118 children of median age 12 months (inter-quartile range: 7-48 months). Forty-three (36%) isolates were non-typeable (NTHi) and 8 were not typed. Of the 67 typeable (THi), Hia (H. influenzae serotype a) (n=36, 54%), Hif (serotype f) (n=19, 26%) and Hib (serotype b) (n=9, 13%) dominated. The THi was more likely than NTHi bacteremia to present as meningitis (p<0.001), particularly serotype a (p=0.04) and less likely to present as pneumonia (p<0.001). Complicated disease (defined as intensive care unit admission, need for surgery, long-term sequelae or death) occurred in 31 (26%) cases and were more likely to have meningitis (p<0.001) than were those with uncomplicated disease. CONCLUSION: In the era of efficacious conjugate Hib vaccines, NTHi, Hia and Hif have emerged as the leading causes of invasive Hi in Canadian children, with Hia being most likely to result in meningitis and complicated disease. A vaccine for all NTHi and THi would be ideal, but knowledge of the current disease burden from circulating strains will inform prioritization of vaccine targets.",
