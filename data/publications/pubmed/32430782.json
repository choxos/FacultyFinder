  "title": "Calidad de Vida: a systematic review of quality of life in Latino cancer survivors in the USA.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics/Latinos. Thus, understanding health-related quality of life (HRQOL) needs among this diverse racial/ethnic group is critical. Using Ferrell's multidimensional framework for measuring QOL, we synthesized evidence on HRQOL needs among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO, for English language articles published between 1995 and January 2020, reporting HRQOL among Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors in the USA. RESULTS: Of the 648 articles reviewed, 176 met inclusion criteria, with 100 of these studies focusing exclusively on breast cancer patients and no studies examining end-of-life HRQOL issues. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, Hispanics/Latinos reported lower HRQOL and a higher symptom burden across multiple HRQOL domains. Over 80% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences in psychological well-being (n = 45) reported worse outcomes among Hispanics/Latinos compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Hispanic/Latino cancer survivors were also more likely to report suboptimal physical well-being in 60% of studies assessing racial/ethnic differences (n = 27), and Hispanics/Latinos also reported lower social well-being relative to non-Hispanics/Latinos in 78% of studies reporting these outcomes (n = 32). In contrast, reports of spiritual well-being and spirituality-based coping were higher among Hispanics/Latinos cancer survivors in 50% of studies examining racial/ethnic differences (n = 15). DISCUSSION: Findings from this review point to the need for more systematic and tailored interventions to address HRQOL needs among this growing cancer survivor population. Future HRQOL research on Hispanics/Latinos should evaluate variations in HRQOL needs across cancer types and Hispanic/Latino subgroups and assess HRQOL needs during metastatic and end-of-life disease phases.",
