  "title": "The creation of a national coalition to target adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: a meeting report.",
  "abstract": "In this report, we document the discussions and recommendations of a national conference designed to create a coalition to tackle adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) held on June 6 and 7, 2017 in Hamilton, ON, Canada. The goal of the establishment of this coalition is to join the efforts of patients, parents, physicians, researchers and other stakeholders to identify stakeholders' perspectives and to categorize gaps in knowledge and target further AIS research and clinical care priorities. The participants' main priorities included focus on shared decision making regarding clinical and research priorities between the stakeholders on the clinical, research and policy sides with patients and families. In addition, improvements in the dissemination of information via digital platforms and identification of cost-effective screening strategies that may help early identification and intervention were also recognized as a priority. Commitment was reached to form a national coalition to understand the determinants of this condition and enhance patient outcomes through improved clinical care and research efforts.",
