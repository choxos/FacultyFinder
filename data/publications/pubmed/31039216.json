  "abstract": "A 9-day-old boy was brought to the emergency department by his mother. The infant had been doing well until his most recent diaper change when his mother noticed a rash around the umbilicus, genitalia, and anus. The infant was born at term via spontaneous vaginal delivery. The pregnancy was uncomplicated; the infant's mother was group B strep negative. Following a routine postpartum course, the infant underwent an elective circumcision before hospital discharge on his second day of life. There were no interval reports of irritability, poor feeding, fevers, vomiting, or changes in urine or stool output.",
