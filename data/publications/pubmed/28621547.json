  "abstract": "The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) is a promising approach for the remediation of wastewater. The present study aims to develop a plant-bacteria system within CWs for the efficient remediation of tannery effluent. In a vertical-flow CW vegetated with Leptochloa fusca (Kallar grass), a consortium of three different endophytic bacteria, Pantoea stewartii ASI11, Microbacterium arborescens HU33, and Enterobacter sp. HU38, was used for bioaugmentation. CWs vegetated with only L. fusca had the potential to remediate tannery effluent, but augmentation with endophytic bacteria enhanced the growth of L. fusca while aiding in the removal of both organic and inorganic pollutants from the tannery effluent. Moreover, the bacterial augmentation decreased toxicity in the effluent as well. A higher number of chromium (Cr)-resistant bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere and endosphere of L. fusca inoculated with the endophytes than from uninoculated plants. Due to promising bioremediation and detoxification potential of L. fusca, it is reported for the first time as a potential candidate to develop effective CWs for the remediation of polluted effluents in combination with pollutant-degrading endophytic bacteria.",
