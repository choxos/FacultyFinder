  "title": "Frailty Is Associated With Increased Hemagglutination-Inhibition Titers in a 4-Year Randomized Trial Comparing Standard- and High-Dose Influenza Vaccination.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although high-dose (HD) vaccines have been reported to stimulate higher antibody responses compared with standard-dose (SD) influenza vaccines, there have been limited studies on the impact of frailty on such responses. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial (2014/2015 to 2017/2018) of SD versus HD trivalent split-virus vaccine (Fluzone) in 612 study participants aged 65+â€…over 4 influenza seasons. Hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers for influenza H1N1, H3N2, and B vaccine subtypes were measured at baseline and at 4, 10, and 20 weeks postvaccination and frailty was measured using a validated frailty index. RESULTS: Geometric mean antibody titers were significantly higher in HD compared with SD vaccine recipients for all influenza subtypes at all time points postvaccination. However, frailty was positively correlated with 4-week titers and was associated with increased odds of being a vaccine responder. For influenza A subtypes, this was mostly limited to HD recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty was associated with higher titers and increased antibody responses at 4 weeks after influenza vaccination, which was partially dependent on vaccine dosage. Chronic inflammation or dysregulated immunity, both of which are commonly observed with frailty, may be responsible, but it requires further investigation.",
