  "title": "Presynaptic inhibition selectively suppresses leg proprioception in behaving Drosophila.",
  "abstract": "Controlling arms and legs requires feedback from proprioceptive sensory neurons that detect joint position and movement. Proprioceptive feedback must be tuned for different behavioral contexts, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across behaviors, whereas the axons of movement-encoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. The predominant synaptic inputs to these interneurons are descending neurons, suggesting they are driven by predictions of leg movement originating in the brain. Calcium imaging from both the interneurons and their descending inputs confirmed that their activity is correlated with self-generated but not passive leg movements. Overall, our findings elucidate a neural circuit for suppressing specific proprioceptive feedback signals during self-generated movements.",
