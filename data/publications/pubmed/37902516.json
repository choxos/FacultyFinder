  "title": "Measures of perceived mobility ability in community-dwelling older adults: a systematic review of psychometric properties.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this systematic review was to synthesise the psychometric properties of measures of perceived mobility ability and related frameworks used to define and operationalise mobility in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: We registered the review protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42022306689) and included studies that examined the psychometric properties of perceived mobility measures in community-dwelling older adults. Five databases were searched to identify potentially relevant primary studies. We qualitatively summarised psychometric property estimates and related operational frameworks. We conducted risk of bias and overall quality assessments, and meta-analyses when at least three studies were included for a particular outcome. The synthesised results were compared against the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments criteria for good measurement properties. RESULTS: A total of 36 studies and 17 measures were included in the review. The Late-Life Function and Disability Index: function component (LLFDI-FC), lower extremity functional scale (LEFS), Mobility Assessment Tool (MAT)-short form (MAT-SF) or MAT-Walking, and Perceived Driving Abilities (PDA) Scale were identified with three or more eligible studies. Most measures showed sufficient test-retest reliability (moderate or high), while the PDA scale showed insufficient reliability (low). Most measures had sufficient or inconsistent convergent validity (low or moderate) or known-groups validity (low or very low), but their predictive validity and responsiveness were insufficient or inconsistent (low or very low). Few studies used a conceptual model. CONCLUSION: The LLFDI-FC, LEFS, PDA and MAT-SF/Walking can be used in community-dwelling older adults by considering the summarised psychometric properties. No available comprehensive mobility measure was identified that covered all mobility domains.",
