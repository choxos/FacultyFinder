  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A systematic review on acceptability, feasibility, equity and resource use was conducted as part of updating recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada on prenatal screening for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG). METHODS: Information sources, including MEDLINE® All, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL (January 2003-January 2021) electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed acceptability, feasibility, equity and resource use of screening for CT or NG in pregnant persons aged ≥12 years. The Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Non-Randomized Studies was used for quality assessment and a narrative synthesis was prepared. RESULTS: Of the 1,386 records identified, nine observational studies (approximately 5,000 participants) and three economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. In general, pregnant persons and healthcare providers accepted screening. Most pregnant persons and partners supported universal testing for CT. Pregnant persons preferred non-invasive sampling methods. Inequities in feasibility (accessibility to screening) exist in certain populations. Studies have shown that targeted screening can miss cases. Screening all pregnant persons for CT has net cost savings compared to no screening. Limitations include not identifying eligible literature on acceptability of prenatal screening for NG among partners of pregnant persons and some studies with increased risk populations that restrict the generalizability of the findings highlighting areas for future research. CONCLUSION: Prenatal screening for CT and NG is generally acceptable among pregnant persons and healthcare providers. Evidence has shown that targeted screening can miss cases. The findings were included when updating PHAC's recommendations on prenatal screening for CT and NG. This work was presented at the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada's 2024 Annual Clinical and Scientific Conference in Edmonton, Alberta.",
