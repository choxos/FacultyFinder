  "abstract": "With the advent of the skin sparing mastectomy, immediate breast reconstruction with placement of the definitive prosthesis at the time of mastectomy is possible. The question remains: does single-stage prosthetic reconstruction result in greater numbers of complications or rates of re-operation, compared to two-stage tissue expander reconstruction? A retrospective cohort study of a single centre?s experience with these techniques was carried out. From 2004 to 2012, 54 cases of immediate breast reconstruction with implant were identified, and 108 cases of immediate breast reconstruction using a tissue expander were identified. Gathered preoperative data included tumour, prior exposure to radiation, preoperative chemotherapy, smoking, and comorbidities. Complication rates, as well as the rate of secondary operations, were examined. There were no significant increased risks in the rate of post-operative complications (p = .910, odds ratio = 0.9) nor in the rate of re-operation (p = 0.421, odds ratio = 1.4) associated with the insertion of a definitive prosthesis at the time of skin sparing mastectomy. However, previously radiated breasts experienced a 100% rate of wound complications in our subset of 9 breasts that underwent one stage breast reconstruction with immediate final prosthesis placement. Our study suggests that patients with early stage disease can undergo single stage breast reconstruction without increased risk of complications nor need for secondary operations. While the mean time to completion of the reconstructive process is shortened by 5 months with the single stage technique, implant based breast reconstruction requires careful counseling and patient selection in radiated patients.",
