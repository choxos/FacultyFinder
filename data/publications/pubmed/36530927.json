  "abstract": "In terms of treatment, a particularly targeted drug is needed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Although there are currently no specific drugs for COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) is clearly effective. It is recommended that through data analysis and mining of TCM cases (expert experience) and population evidence (RCT and cohort studies), core prescriptions for various efficacy can be obtained. Starting from a multidimensional model of regulating immunity, improving inflammation, and protecting multiple organs, this paper constructs a multidimensional model of targeted drug discovery, integrating molecular, cellular, and animal efficacy evaluation. Through functional activity testing, biophysical detection of compound binding to target proteins, multidimensional pharmacodynamic evaluation systems of cells (Vero E6, Vero, Vero81, Huh7, and caca2) and animals (mice infected with the new coronavirus, rhesus macaques, and hamsters), the effectiveness of effective preparations was evaluated, and various efficacy effects including lung moisturizing, dehumidification and detoxification were obtained. Using modern technology, it is now possible to understand how the immune system is controlled, how inflammation is reduced, and how various organs are protected. Complete early drug characterization and finally obtain effective targeted TCM. This article provides a demonstration resource for the development of new drugs specifically for TCM.",
