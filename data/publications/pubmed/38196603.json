  "title": "Unveiling the autoreactome: Proteome-wide immunological fingerprints reveal the promise of plasma cell depleting therapy.",
  "abstract": "The prevalence and burden of autoimmune and autoantibody mediated disease is increasing worldwide, yet most disease etiologies remain unclear. Despite numerous new targeted immunomodulatory therapies, comprehensive approaches to apply and evaluate the effects of these treatments longitudinally are lacking. Here, we leverage advances in programmable-phage immunoprecipitation (PhIP-Seq) methodology to explore the modulation, or lack thereof, of proteome-wide autoantibody profiles in both health and disease. We demonstrate that each individual, regardless of disease state, possesses a distinct set of autoreactivities constituting a unique immunological fingerprint, or \"autoreactome\", that is remarkably stable over years. In addition to uncovering important new biology, the autoreactome can be used to better evaluate the relative effectiveness of various therapies in altering autoantibody repertoires. We find that therapies targeting B-Cell Maturation Antigen (BCMA) profoundly alter an individual's autoreactome, while anti-CD19 and CD-20 therapies have minimal effects, strongly suggesting a rationale for BCMA or other plasma cell targeted therapies in autoantibody mediated diseases.",
