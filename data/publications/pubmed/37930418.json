  "title": "Programs and processes for advancing pediatric acute kidney support therapy in hospitalized and critically ill children: a report from the 26th Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) consensus conference.",
  "abstract": "Pediatric acute kidney support therapy (paKST) programs aim to reliably provide safe, effective, and timely extracorporeal supportive care for acutely and critically ill pediatric patients with acute kidney injury (AKI), fluid and electrolyte derangements, and/or toxin accumulation with a goal of improving both hospital-based and lifelong outcomes. Little is known about optimal ways to configure paKST teams and programs, pediatric-specific aspects of delivering high-quality paKST, strategies for transitioning from acute continuous modes of paKST to facilitate rehabilitation, or providing effective short- and long-term follow-up. As part of the 26th Acute Disease Quality Initiative Conference, the first to focus on a pediatric population, we summarize here the current state of knowledge in paKST programs and technology, identify key knowledge gaps in the field, and propose a framework for current best practices and future research in paKST.",
