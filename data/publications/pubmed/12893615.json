  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study compared trends in the incidence of work-related morbidity and disability across 3 sources of surveillance data in a Canadian province. METHODS: Time series estimates of workplace injuries and work-related disability based on 2 panel surveys in the province of Ontario, Canada, for the period 1993-1998 were compared with rates of work-related injury and illness compensation claims during the same period. RESULTS: Lost-time compensation claims declined by 28.8% over this 6-year period. The incidence of self-reported work-related injury declined by 28.2%, and the self-reported incidence of work absence for work-related causes declined by 32.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Parallel reductions in work-related morbidity were seen in 3 independent data sources. These results support an interpretation that there has been an important reduction in injury risk in Ontario workplaces over the past decade.",
