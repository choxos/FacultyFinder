  "title": "Barriers and Facilitators for Sexual Trauma Disclosure in Boys and Men: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Disclosing sexual trauma can support recovery and healing for victim-survivors. Despite evidence indicating low disclosure rates and long disclosure delays in sexual trauma-exposed boys and men, little is known about factors impacting disclosure in this group. A systematic review was conducted to consolidate evidence surrounding barriers, facilitators, and predictors of disclosure likelihood and timing in boys and men following sexual trauma (i.e., sexual abuse, assaults, and coercion). Disclosure included formal reporting, help-seeking, and discussions with social supports. Four electronic databases (PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Medline) were searched and 69 articles (42 qualitative, 25 quantitative, two mixed-methods) were included, representing 10,517 sexual trauma-exposed boys and men and 297 supports of sexual trauma-exposed boys and men (e.g., police, mental health practitioners). Barriers and facilitators were mapped according to levels of the social ecology. Boys' and men's understanding of, and responses to, sexual trauma were informed by perceived masculine norm violations and minimal public acknowledgement and validation of their trauma. These factors were compounded by a dearth of appropriate supports and practitioner knowledge. Assessed predictors of disclosure outcomes were highly variable, indicating limited theoretical understanding of factors likely to impact disclosure and need for greater methodological rigor and integration of theory into this domain. Scholarship remains biased towards disclosure barriers, with little emphasis on strengths-based factors that support help-seeking. Findings highlight impacts of gender socialisation processes on long-term experiences of sexual trauma. Implications for practice, policy, and research are discussed, including need for greater awareness and support for sexual trauma-exposed boys and men.",
