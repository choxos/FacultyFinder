  "title": "Harvesting Magneto-Acoustic Waves Using Magnetic 2D Chromium Telluride (CrTe3).",
  "abstract": "A vast majority of electrical devices have integrated magnetic units, which generate constant magnetic fields with noticeable vibrations. The majority of existing nanogenerators acquire energy through friction/mechanical forces and most of these instances overlook acoustic vibrations and magnetic fields. Magnetic two-dimensional (2D) tellurides present a wide range of possibilities for devising a potential flexible energy harvester. 2D chromium telluride (2D CrTe3) is synthesized, which exhibits ferromagnetic behavior with a higher T c of â‰ˆ224 K. The structure exhibits stable high remnant magnetization, making 2D CrTe3 a potential material for harvesting magneto-acoustic waves. A magneto-acoustic nanogenerator (MANG) is fabricated and the basic mechanical stability and sensitivity of the device with change in load conditions are tested. A high surface charge density of 2.919 mC m[-2] is obtained for the device. The thermal strain created in the lattice structure is examined using in-situ Raman spectroscopy. The magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) responsible for long-range FM ordering is calculated by theoretical modelling with insights into opening of electronic bandgap which enhances the flexoelectric effects. The MANG can be a potential NG to synergistically tap into the magneto-acoustic vibrations generated from the frequency changes of a vibrating device such as loudspeakers.",
