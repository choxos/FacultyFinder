  "abstract": "This study assessed the impact and cost-effectiveness of an on-site health clinic at a self-insured university. Health care costs and number of claims filed to primary care providers were trended before and after the clinic was established to determine savings. A retrospective chart review of all full-time, insured employees treated for upper respiratory tract infections (URIs) during a 1-year study period was conducted. On-site clinic costs for the treatment of URIs were compared to costs at outside community providers for similar care. Community cost norms for the treatment of URIs were provided by Primary Physicians Care, the administrator of insurance claims for the University. A cost-benefit analysis compared the cost of services on-site versus similar services at an outside community provider. Based on the results of this study, the University's on-site health care services were determined to be more cost-effective than similar off-site health care services for the treatment of URIs.
