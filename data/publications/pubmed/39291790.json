  "title": "Exploring context and culture in clinical reasoning medical education: A qualitative exploratory study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinical reasoning processes are complex and interwoven with culture and context. While these relationships have been explored to understand the outcomes of clinical reasoning, there has been little exploration of how to integrate these relationships when teaching and learning clinical reasoning. METHODS: Using semi-structured interviews, this research explored the role of context and culture in clinical reasoning medical education. Participants were clinical teachers recruited from across Northern Ontario. The data were analysed independently by two reviewers using both thematic analysis and critical discourse analysis, and peer reviewed by a third researcher. RESULTS: The role of context and culture is inherent to the personal, professional and pedagogical aspects of clinical reasoning, especially when teaching about the complexities of Northern Ontario. The major themes that came through were: 1) teaching and learning clinical reasoning needs reflexivity, 2) developing clinical reasoning skills needs time and 3) clinical reasoning pedagogy should acknowledge and encompass practice variation and patient diversity. CONCLUSION: Teaching clinical reasoning in Northern Ontario involves being aware of the complexities that are inherent in interacting with patients and communities. Through personal, professional and pedagogical models, the students and teachers can address the complexities of cultural and contextual clinical reasoning.",
