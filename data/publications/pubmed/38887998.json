  "title": "Tea and coffee consumption and risk of acute stroke: The INTERSTROKE Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading global cause of death and disability. Daily tea/coffee intake is consumed by > 50% of populations and may represent an important population-level exposure. Therefore, it is first essential that we better understand the associations between the tea/coffee intake and stroke. AIMS: This research aims to generate hypotheses about the global associations between tea and coffee intake and stroke. These insights will identify interventions for stroke prevention that can be further explored using alternative study designs. METHODS: INTERSTROKE is a large international matched case-control study of first stroke from 32 countries. Participants were asked \"how many cups do you drink each day?\" of coffee, green tea, black tea, and other tea. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between intake and stroke. RESULTS: We included 13,462 cases and 13,488 controls from INTERSTROKE; mean age was 61.7 (13.4) years and 59.6% (n = 16,010) were male. Overall, 19.4% (n = 5239) did not consume tea/coffee, 47.0% (n = 12,666) consumed tea only, 14.9% (n = 4024) consumed coffee alone, and 18.6% (n = 5021) consumed both, with significant regional variations. After multivariable adjustment, there was no association between low/moderate coffee intake and stroke, but high consumption (> 4/day) was associated with higher odds of all stroke (OR = 1.37 (95% CI = 1.06-1.77)) or ischemic stroke (OR = 1.32 (95% CI = 1.00-1.74)). Tea consumption was associated with lower odds of all (OR = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.69-0.94) for highest intake) or ischemic stroke (OR = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.68-0.98) for highest intake). CONCLUSIONS: High coffee consumption was associated with higher odds of all or ischemic stroke; low-moderate coffee had no association with stroke. In contrast, tea consumption was associated with lower odds of stroke. These associations suggest that individuals consider avoiding high coffee consumption (⩾ five cups/day) to impact future stroke risk. DATA ACCESS STATEMENT: The design and rationale of INTERSTROKE was published previously. Individual participant data, or other documents are not available.",
