  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Policymakers and payers are reevaluating the temporary telehealth flexibilities granted during the COVID-19 public health emergency, which will shape future teledermatology utilization. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the recently expanded telehealth flexibilities in the United States, projected changes, and corresponding implications for dermatologists. METHODS: Narrative review of the literature, United States policies and regulations, and white paper reports. RESULTS: Key telehealth flexibilities included expansion of payment parity, relaxation of originating site requirements, loosening of state licensure requirements, and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996) enforcement discretion. These changes enabled widespread accessibility and adoption of teledermatology, which enhanced high-quality and cost-effective dermatologic care. Most waivers will end 151Â days following the end of the public health emergency declaration. Notably, asynchronous telehealth was not included in the reimbursement expansion. LIMITATIONS: Only policies and regulations through December 2022 are included. CONCLUSION: It will be important for the field of dermatology to stay abreast of the upcoming changes in telemedicine policies and reimbursement, to demonstrate teledermatology's value through evidence-based studies and to advocate for enduring policies that will promote the accessibility of teledermatology for patients.",
