  "title": "Role of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α as Potential Biomarkers in Ischemic Heart Disease: A Comparative Study of Patients with CAD and Non-CAD.",
  "abstract": "Background: Ischemic heart disease (CAD), a leading global health burden, arises primarily from atherosclerosis, an inflammatory condition characterized by lipid accumulation and metabolic dysregulation. The precise contribution of inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α) to CAD pathogenesis remains an area of significant research. Aim: The primary aim of this study is to examine the IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and compare them with Non-CAD individuals to evaluate their potential as diagnostic biomarkers for CAD. Methodology: A prospective observational study was conducted over 3 years, involving 100 participants divided into CAD and non-CAD groups. Blood samples were isolated and analyzed for IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-α levels utilizing ELISA kits. Biochemical parameters, including lipid profiles, were also assessed. Results: This study observed significantly elevated IL-6 in patients with CAD compared with controls, while IL-2 and TNF-α levels did not reach statistical significance. The CAD group exhibited dyslipidemia characterized by elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL. Furthermore, the CAD group demonstrated alterations in biochemical parameters, including lower albumin and calcium levels, higher urea and uric acid levels, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. These findings suggest a systemic inflammatory state and metabolic disturbances in patients with CAD. Conclusions: This study highlights IL-6 as a potential biomarker and key player in CAD pathogenesis. These findings warrant further investigation into the therapeutic potential of targeting inflammatory pathways for cardiovascular risk reduction.",
