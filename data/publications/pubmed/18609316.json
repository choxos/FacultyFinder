  "abstract": "The Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2) Fake Bad Scale (FBS; Butcher, Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989) has been shown to be sensitive to somatic over-endorsement. However, the impact of ethnicity has not been examined on the FBS, which is of concern given some studies that show increased rates of somatic endorsement in particular ethnic groups. We evaluated the FBS performance of 190 Caucasian American, Hispanic, and African American outpatients who were obtained from two different clinical settings, excluding those who were applying for disability or in litigation. We failed to find significant ethnic differences in mean FBS performance or in cut-off specificity rates. We did find evidence of a gender effect, supporting continued use of gender-specific FBS cutoffs.",
