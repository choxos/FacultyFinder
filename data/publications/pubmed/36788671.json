  "abstract": "Corticosteroids (CS) and exclusive and partial enteral nutrition (EEN and PEN) are effective therapies in paediatric Crohn's disease (CD). This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) and cohort studies analyses the impact of EEN/PEN v. CS on intestinal microbiota, mucosal healing as well as other clinically important outcomes, including clinical remission, relapse, adherence, adverse events and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in paediatric CD. Three RCT (n 76) and sixteen cohort studies (n 1104) compared EEN v. CS. With limited available data (one RCT), the effect on intestinal microbiome indicated a trend towards EEN regarding Shannon diversity. Based on two RCT, EEN achieved higher mucosal healing than CS (risk ratio (RR) 2·36, 95 % CI (1·22, 4·57), low certainty). Compared with CS, patients on EEN were less likely to experience adverse events based on two RCT (RR 0·32, 95 % CI (0·13, 0·80), low certainty). For HRQL, there was a trend in favour of CS based on data from two published abstracts of cohort studies. Based on thirteen cohort studies, EEN achieved higher clinical remission than CS (RR 1·18, 95 % CI (1·02, 1·38), very low certainty). Studies also reported no important differences in relapse and adherence. Compared with CS, EEN may improve mucosal healing with fewer adverse events based on RCT data. While limited data indicate the need for further trials, this is the first systematic review to comprehensively summarise the data on intestinal microbiome, mucosal healing and HRQOL when comparing enteral nutrition and CS in paediatric CD.",
