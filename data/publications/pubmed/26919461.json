  "title": "Adverse Events During Anti-TNFα Therapies in IBD (Excluding Infections and Malignancies): When to Stop, Continue, or Switch Therapies.",
  "abstract": "There are several adverse events that can occur in the setting of tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor treatment for inflammatory bowel disease. The most common side effects include infection and malignancy. There are however several less frequent adverse events that can be classified as dermatologic, neurologic, cardiac, and hepatic. The aim of this review was to assist clinicians to recognize and manage these infrequent adverse events that occur during use of tumor necrosis factor-α antagonists.",
