  "title": "Insights into the Mechanisms Involved in Lead (Pb) Tolerance in Invasive Plants-The Current Status of Understanding.",
  "abstract": "Invasive plant species possess remarkable abilities to establish themselves in new environments and to displace native species. Their success can be attributed to various physiological and biochemical mechanisms, allowing them to tolerate adverse environmental conditions, including high lead (Pb) toxicity. Comprehension of the mechanisms responsible for Pb tolerance in invasive plants is still limited, but it is rapidly evolving. Researchers have identified several strategies in invasive plants to tolerate high levels of Pb. This review provides an overview of the current understanding of the ability of invasive species to tolerate or even accumulate Pb in plant tissues, including vacuoles and cell walls, as well as how rhizosphere biota (bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi) help them to enhance Pb tolerance in polluted soils. Furthermore, the article highlights the physiological and molecular mechanisms regulating plant responses to Pb stress. The potential applications of these mechanisms in developing strategies for remediating Pb-contaminated soils are also discussed. Specifically, this review article provides a comprehensive understanding of the current status of research on the mechanisms involved in Pb tolerance in invasive plants. The information presented in this article may be useful in developing effective strategies for managing Pb-contaminated soils, as well as for developing more resilient crops in the face of environmental stressors.",
