  "abstract": "Remote ambulatory cardiac monitoring (rACM) could identify high-grade atrioventricular block (AVB) before and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing TAVR, with 14-day rACM before and after TAVR, was performed. Of 62 patients undergoing TAVR, 41 patients had rACM before TAVR. Three patients had asymptomatic AVB leading to planned pacemaker (PM) implant. After TAVR, 23 patients had rACM, with 1 patient requiring a PM implant for asymptomatic AVB. Five patients underwent unplanned PM after TAVR. Using rACM, almost half of PM implants in TAVR recipients were identified electively. High-grade AVB requiring PM was identified in nearly 10% of patients before TAVR.",
