  "title": "Development and Implementation of a Structured and Innovative Faculty-Wide Mentorship Program for a Large Department of Psychiatry.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Mentorship supports faculty to succeed in their careers with confidence, resilience, and satisfaction. To address inequities evident with an informal approach, a formal mentorship program was designed and implemented. METHODS: The Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) was applied. Engagement with key stakeholders and users was emphasized. The goals of the program are to address inequities and create greater satisfaction with academic careers among diverse faculty working in various roles/sites. A central component is a primary 1:1 mentor/mentee model, supported with an online matching tool. 1:1 mentorship is augmented with several group mentorships, to support specific academic roles (e.g., clinician scientists; clinician teachers) or social identity. Mentorship training workshops and resources support mentors/mentees; topics include best practices, DEI, and mentorship and mentorship tools. Descriptive statistics (means, SDs, percentages) summarized findings on mentees/mentors at enrollment. RESULTS: Sixty-six mentors registered. Recently hired faculty (n = 136) were invited to participate, resulting in 105 mentees (77%). There is a significant improvement in mentor perception of the department's culture of mentorship (t(198) = 4.188, p < 0.001). Key mentee goals were to gain career guidance and support, information on academic promotion, skills in professional relationships, and networking. Identified challenges among mentors/mentees include having differing goals, time commitment, and managing difficult conversations. Mentorship groups were well-received with high satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Uptake and participation is encouraging. QIF will help identify contextual factors related to uptake and use of the program and additional implementation strategies needed. The project will contribute to literature on implementation and sustainability of mentorship programs.",
