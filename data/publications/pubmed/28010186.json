  "title": "Graphical aids for visualizing and interpreting patterns in departures from agreement in ordinal categorical observer agreement data.",
  "abstract": "When studying the agreement between two observers rating the same n units into the same k discrete ordinal categories, Bangdiwala (1985) proposed using the \"agreement chart\" to visually assess agreement. This article proposes that often it is more interesting to focus on the patterns of disagreement and visually understanding the departures from perfect agreement. The article reviews the use of graphical techniques for descriptively assessing agreement and disagreements, and also reviews some of the available summary statistics that quantify such relationships.",
