  "title": "Knee osteoarthritis: when arthroscopy can help.",
  "abstract": "Arthroscopic surgery of the knee is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed globally. Recently, a lot of attention has been directed towards the role of arthroscopic surgery in the setting of osteoarthritis (OA) and its role in degenerative knee pathology. A number of recent randomized control trials and systematic reviews have suggested limited benefit for arthroscopic surgery and partial meniscectomy for this indication. With this recent focus on the use of arthroscopy in OA, it is often forgotten that arthroscopy plays an important role in the management of other pathologies involving the knee in patients who may have a concomitant diagnosis of OA. This evidenceâ€‘based review highlights indications for when arthroscopic intervention is warranted in such patients.",
