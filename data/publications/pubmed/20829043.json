  "title": "Willingness of breast cancer survivors to participate in a randomized controlled trial of digital mammography with or without MRI as breast cancer surveillance: a feasibility study.",
  "abstract": "Breast MRI is often used for surveillance of breast cancer (BC) survivors despite the lack of evidence in this population. We surveyed younger BC survivors to evaluate their willingness to participate in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of annual digital mammography with or without MRI. Median age of the 348 participants was 51 years; 45% had undergone diagnostic MRI. 22% continued to have surveillance MRI. 58% agreed to consider participating in the proposed RCT; 16% remained neutral. An RCT of MRI surveillance for BC survivors <age 60 is still feasible at centres where annual MRI is not yet routinely recommended.",
