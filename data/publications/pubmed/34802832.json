  "title": "Cognitive Aids for the Management of Thoracic Anesthesia Emergencies: Consensus Guidelines on Behalf of a Canadian Thoracic Taskforce.",
  "abstract": "A cognitive aid is a tool used to help people accurately and efficiently perform actions. Similarly themed cognitive aids may be collated into a manual to provide relevant information for a specific context (eg, operating room emergencies). Expert content and design are paramount to facilitate the utility of a cognitive aid, especially during a crisis when accessible memory may be limited and distractions may impair task completion. A cognitive aid does not represent a rigid approach to problem-solving or a replacement for decision-making. Successful cognitive aid implementation requires dedicated training, access, and culture integration. Here the authors present a set of evidence-based cognitive aids for thoracic anesthesia emergencies developed by a Canadian thoracic taskforce.",
