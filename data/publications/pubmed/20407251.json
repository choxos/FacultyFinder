  "title": "Basic requirements for monitoring sedated patients: blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and EKG.",
  "abstract": "The American Society of Anesthesiologists published monitoring requirements for non-anesthesia providers performing sedation and analgesia in 2002. This manuscript covered not only the monitoring of patients under sedation and analgesia but pre-procedure evaluation and preparation, personnel availability and training, emergency equipment availability, use of supplemental oxygen, sedative-analgesic agents, and discharge criteria. Current recommendations for monitoring include patient responsiveness, blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, and oxygen saturation. Oxygen saturation is a critical vital sign, but there can be a significant delay between inadequate ventilation and desaturation. Supplemental oxygen can dangerously increase this disconnect. Thus, one must monitor adequacy of ventilation by direct observation, auscultation, and/or end-tidal CO(2) monitoring. The most important admonition is that 'ventilation' and 'oxygenation' are not the same.",
