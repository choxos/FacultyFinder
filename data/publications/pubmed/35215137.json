  "abstract": "Human cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a worldwide-distributed parasitic zoonotic disease, which represents a threat for both human and animals. The current study aimed at estimating the prevalence of human CE in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) province of Pakistan. Clinical records from four major hospitals in this region were reviewed for CE human cases during the period of 2006-2021. Out of 251 (0.00071%) CE patients identified during the considered period, 142 (56.6%) were females, and 109 (43.4%) were males. The highest number of CE cases was recorded in the 21-30 (27.9%) age group, followed by 31-40 (23.1%) and 41-50 (16.3%). Most of the CE patients in KPK province were members of the Afghani ethnic group (17.1%); secondarily, they were Pakistani (6.4%), while for 76.5% ethnicity data were not available. The liver (41%) and the lungs (4.8%) were the most infected organs identified among CE patients in KPK province. The present study identified CE as a significant public health problem in KPK province, and the current findings demonstrated a constant endemicity of CE during the last 15 years. Further filed studies on the active search of CE carriers by means of ultrasound population-based surveys are needed to fill knowledge gaps on clinical and molecular epidemiology of human CE in Pakistan.",
