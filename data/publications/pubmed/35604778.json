  "title": "Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: A multi-institutional study from the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative.",
  "abstract": "Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a mesenchymal neoplasm of intermediate malignancy. We describe the largest cohort of IMT patients to date, aiming to further characterize this rare, poorly understood tumor. This is a multi-institutional review of IMT patients ≤39 years, from 2000 to 2018, at 18 hospitals in the Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative. One hundred and eighty-two patients were identified with median age of 11 years. Thirty-three percent of tumors were thoracic in origin. Presenting signs/symptoms included pain (29%), respiratory symptoms (25%) and constitutional symptoms (20%). Median tumor size was 3.9 cm. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) overexpression was identified in 53% of patients. Seven percent of patients had distant disease at diagnosis. Ninety-one percent of patients underwent resection: 14% received neoadjuvant treatment and 22% adjuvant treatment. Twelve percent of patients received an ALK inhibitor. Sixty-six percent of surgical patients had complete resection, with 20% positive microscopic margins and 14% gross residual disease. Approximately 40% had en bloc resection of involved organs. Median follow-up time was 36 months. Overall 5-year survival was 95% and 5-year event-free survival was 80%. Predictors of recurrence included respiratory symptoms, tumor size and distant disease. Gross or microscopic margins were not associated with recurrence, suggesting that aggressive attempts at resection may not be warranted.",
