  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To provide guidelines for the health care provider on the diagnosis and clinical management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. OUTCOMES: Strategies for identifying and evaluating high-risk individuals, the use of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers in assessing diagnosis and response to management, and recommendations regarding nutrition, physical activity, and the selection of pharmacologic therapy to prevent and manage osteoporosis. EVIDENCE: MEDLINE and the Cochrane database were searched for articles in English on subjects related to osteoporosis diagnosis, prevention, and management from March 2001 to April 2005. The authors critically reviewed the evidence and developed the recommendations according to the Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada's methodology and consensus development process. VALUES: The quality of evidence is rated using the criteria described in the report of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. Recommendations for practice are ranked according to the method described in this report. SPONSORS: The development of this consensus guideline was supported by unrestricted educational grants from Berlex Canada Inc., Lilly Canada, Merck Frosst, Novartis, Novogen, Novo Nordisk, Proctor and Gamble, Schering Canada, and Wyeth Canada.",
