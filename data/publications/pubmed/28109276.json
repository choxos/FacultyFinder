  "title": "Introduction of microsystems in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit-an interprofessional approach.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Growth of neonatal intensive care units in number and size has raised questions towards ability to maintain continuity and quality of care. Structural organization of intensive care units is known as a key element for maintaining the quality of care of these fragile patients. The reconstruction of megaunits of intensive care to smaller care units within a single operational service might help with provision of safe and effective care. METHODS/DESIGN: The clinical team and patient distribution lay out, admission and discharge criteria and interdisciplinary round model was reorganized to follow the microstructure philosophy. A working group met weekly to formulate the implementation planning, to review the adaptation and adjustment process and to ascertain the quality of implementation following the initiation of the microsystem model. DISCUSSION: In depth examination of microsystem model of care in this study, provides systematic evaluation of this model on variable aspects of health care. The individual projects of this trial can be source of solid evidence for guidance of future decisions on optimized model of care for the critically ill newborns.
