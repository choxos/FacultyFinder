  "title": "Serum fructosamine and subsequent breast cancer risk: a nested case-control study in the ORDET prospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "There is evidence that abnormal glucose metabolism may contribute to the risk of breast cancer. The measurement of markers of glucose metabolism could help to identify women at risk for breast cancer. Serum fructosamine is one such marker. In this study, we investigated whether prediagnostic serum fructosamine was associated with breast cancer. Between 1987 and 1992, 10,786 women ages 35 to 69 were recruited in Italy for a prospective study. Women with a history of cancer or on hormone therapy were excluded at baseline. Blood samples were collected after 12 hours fasting from all participants at recruitment. After 5.5 years of follow-up, 144 breast cancer cases were identified and four matched controls were selected from the cohort; serum fructosamine levels were measured in both groups at baseline. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for the highest tertile of serum fructosamine compared to the lowest was 1.60 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.95-2.73]. In premenopausal women, the OR was 1.58 (95% CI, 0.76-3.40) and in postmenopausal women, the OR was 1.60 (95% CI, 0.76-3.48). Serum fructosamine levels tended to be positively associated with breast cancer risk independent of menopausal status.",
