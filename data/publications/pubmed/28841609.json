  "title": "Patient-Reported Outcomes in Weight Loss and Body Contouring Surgery: A Cross-Sectional Analysis Using the BODY-Q.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life and satisfaction with appearance are important outcomes in bariatric and body contouring surgery. To investigate these outcomes, scientifically sound and clinically meaningful patient-reported outcome instruments are needed. The authors measured health-related quality of life and appearance in a cohort of Danish patients at different phases in the weight loss journey: before bariatric surgery, after bariatric surgery, before body contouring surgery, and after body contouring surgery. METHODS: From June of 2015 to June of 2016, a cross-sectional sample of 493 bariatric and body contouring patients were recruited from four different hospital departments. Patients were asked to fill out the BODY-Q, a new patient-reported outcomes instrument designed specifically to measure health-related quality of life and appearance over the entire patient journey, from obesity to the post-body contouring surgery period. Data were collected using REDCap, and analyzed using SPSS software. RESULTS: For all appearance and health-related quality-of-life scales, the mean score was significantly lower in the pre-bariatric surgery group compared with the post-body contouring group. Furthermore, the correlation between body mass index and mean scores was significant for all appearance and health-related quality-of-life scales, with higher scores associated with lower body mass index. The mean score for the group reporting no excess skin compared with the group reporting a lot of excess skin was significantly higher for five of seven appearance scales and four of five health-related quality-of-life scales. CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence to suggest that body contouring plays an important role in the weight loss patient's journey and that patients need access to treatments.",
