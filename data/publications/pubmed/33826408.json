  "title": "Psychometric Validation of the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module for Facial Nerve Paralysis.",
  "abstract": "Background: Systematic reviews have identified the need for a patient-reported outcome measure for facial nerve paralysis (FNP). The aim of this study was to determine the psychometric properties of FACE-Q Craniofacial module scales when used in a combined sample of children and older adults with FNP. Methods: Data were collected between December 2016 and December 2019. We conducted qualitative interviews with children and adults with FNP. FACE-Q data were collected from patients aged 8 years and older with FNP. Rasch measurement theory analysis was used to examine the reliability and validity of the relevant scales in the FNP sample. Results: Twenty-five patients provided 2052 qualitative codes related to appearance, physical, psychological, and social function. Many patient concerns were common across age. The field-test sample included 235 patients aged 8-81 years. Of the 13 scales examined, all 122 items had ordered thresholds and good item fit to the Rasch model. For 12 scales, person separation index values were ≥0.79 and Cronbach's alpha values were ≥0.82. The 13th scale's reliability values were ≥0.71. Conclusion: The FACE-Q Craniofacial module scales described in this study can be used to collect and compare evidence-based outcome data from children and adults with FNP.",
