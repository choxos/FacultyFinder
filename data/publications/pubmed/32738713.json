  "abstract": "Data about the toxicological interactions of MPs and heavy metals in biota is limited, particularly in fish early life stages. This study aimed to evaluate the toxicological effects of MPs and copper (Cu), alone or combined, in zebrafish early life stages. Embryos were exposed from 2 until 96-h post-fertilization (hpf) to MPs (2 mg/L), three sub-lethal concentrations of Cu (15, 60 and 125 μg/L) and binary mixtures containing Cu and MPs (Cu15+MPs, Cu60+MPs, Cu125+MPs). Lethal and sub-lethal parameters, histopathological changes, biochemical biomarkers, gene expression and behavior were assessed. Our findings showed that Cu and Cu + MPs decreased embryos survival and hatching rate. Increased ROS levels were observed in larvae exposed to the two lowest Cu and Cu + MPs groups, suggesting an induction of oxidative stress. An increased CAT and GPx activities were observed in Cu and Cu + MPs, implying a response of the antioxidant defense system to overcome the metal and MPs stress. The sod1 expression was downregulated in all Cu groups and in the two highest Cu + MPs exposed groups. AChE was significantly inhibited in Cu and Cu + MPs groups, indicating neurotoxicity. A disruption of avoidance and social behaviors were also noticed in the Cu125 and Cu125+MPs exposed larvae. Evidences of Cu-toxicity modulation by MPs were observed in some endpoints. Overall, the findings of this study highlight that Cu alone or co-exposed with MPs lead to oxidative stress, neurotoxicity and ultimately behavioral alterations in early life stages of zebrafish, while MPs alone do not produce significant effects on zebrafish larvae.",
