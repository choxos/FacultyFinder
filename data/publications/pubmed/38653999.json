  "title": "Chromosome-scale genome assembly of bread wheat's wild relative Triticum timopheevii.",
  "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important food crops with an urgent need for increase in its production to feed the growing world. Triticum timopheevii (2n = 4x = 28) is an allotetraploid wheat wild relative species containing the A[t] and G genomes that has been exploited in many pre-breeding programmes for wheat improvement. In this study, we report the generation of a chromosome-scale reference genome assembly of T. timopheevii accession PI 94760 based on PacBio HiFi reads and chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). The assembly comprised a total size of 9.35 Gb, featuring a contig N50 of 42.4 Mb and included the mitochondrial and plastid genome sequences. Genome annotation predicted 166,325 gene models including 70,365 genes with high confidence. DNA methylation analysis showed that the G genome had on average more methylated bases than the A[t] genome. In summary, the T. timopheevii genome assembly provides a valuable resource for genome-informed discovery of agronomically important genes for food security.",
