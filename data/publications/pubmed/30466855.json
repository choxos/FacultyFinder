  "title": "Early Repolarization Pattern Inheritance in the Cardiac Arrest Survivors With Preserved Ejection Fraction Registry (CASPER).",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study explored early repolarization (ER) pattern inheritance between survivors of unexplained cardiac arrest (UCA) and their first-degree relatives. BACKGROUND: ER is considered a factor that confers an increased risk of sudden death. A monogenic explanation for ER is seldom evident after cascade screening. METHODS: UCA survivors and their first-degree relatives enrolled in the CASPER (Cardiac Arrest Survivors With Preserved Ejection Fraction Registry) were included in the study. ER was defined and characterized according to accepted criteria. Logistic regression was performed to explore the association between ER status in the UCA survivor and first-degree relative groups based on the presence of an ER pattern in their related family members after adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity. RESULTS: A total of 289 patients from 14 Canadian sites were studied (age: 43.0 ± 15.9 years; 148 women), and 945 electrocardiograms were analyzed. Seventy-five patients had the ER pattern. There was a significantly higher prevalence of the ER pattern in UCA survivors who had first-degree relatives with the ER pattern (adjusted odds ratio: 5.79; 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 1.79 to 18.7). There was also a nonsignificant higher prevalence of the ER pattern in first-degree relatives of UCA survivors with the ER pattern (OR: 2.43; 95% CI: 0.70 to 8.43). The highest prevalence of the ER pattern was seen in first-degree relatives of UCA survivors with ER syndrome (29%). CONCLUSIONS: The ER pattern appeared to be more common among UCA survivors and first-degree relatives whose related family members had similar changes on electrocardiography, which suggested that genetically complex factors contribute to electrocardiographic patterns that predispose to cardiac arrest.",
