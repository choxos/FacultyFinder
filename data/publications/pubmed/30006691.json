  "title": "Assessment of Computed Tomography (CT)-Defined Muscle and Adipose Tissue Features in Relation to Short-Term Outcomes After Elective Surgery for Colorectal Cancer: A Multicenter Approach.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sarcopenia, visceral obesity (VO), and reduced muscle radiodensity (myosteatosis) are suggested risk factors for postoperative morbidity in colorectal cancer (CRC), but usually are not concurrently assessed. Published thresholds used to define these features are not CRC-specific and are defined in relation to mortality, not postoperative outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate body composition in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS) and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: Pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) images were assessed for total area and radiodensity of skeletal muscle and visceral adipose tissue in a pooled Canadian and UK cohort (n = 2100). Sex- and age-specific values for these features were calculated. For 1139 of 2100 patients, LOS data were available, and sex- and age-specific thresholds for sarcopenia, myosteatosis, and VO were defined on the basis of LOS. Association of CT-defined features with LOS and readmissions was explored using negative binomial and logistic regression models, respectively. RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the predictors of LOS (P < 0.001) were age, surgical approach, major complications (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 2.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.18-2.68), study cohort, and three body composition profiles characterized by myosteatosis combined with either sarcopenia (IRR, 1.27; 95% CI 1.12-1.43) or VO (IRR, 1.25; 95% CI 1.10-1.42), and myosteatosis combined with both sarcopenia and VO (IRR, 1.58; 95% CI 1.29-1.93). In the multivariable analysis, risk of readmission was associated with VO alone (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95% CI 1.18-6.00); P = 0.018), VO combined with myosteatosis (OR, 2.72; 95% CI 1.36-5.46; P = 0.005), or VO combined with myosteatosis and sarcopenia (OR, 2.98; 95% CI 1.06-5.46; P = 0.038). Importantly, the effect of body composition profiles on LOS and readmission was independent of major complications. CONCLUSION: The findings showed that CT-defined multidimensional body habitus is independently associated with LOS and hospital readmission.",
