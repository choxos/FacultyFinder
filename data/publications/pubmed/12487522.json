  "abstract": "This article presents a case report of a shooting using an antique pistol. The unusual pathological findings are presented, together with a review of the law in this area. It seems that there is currently a loophole in the 1997 Firearms Act by means of which 'enthusiasts' or 'collectors' may legally possess weapons and then subsequently acquire ammunition illegally.",
