  "title": "Assessment of the CYP3A-mediated drug interaction potential of anacetrapib, a potent cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, in healthy volunteers.",
  "abstract": "In this study, midazolam was used as a probe-sensitive CYP3A substrate to investigate the effect of anacetrapib on CYP3A activity, and ketoconazole was used as a probe-inhibitor to investigate the effect of potent CYP3A inhibition on the pharmacokinetics of anacetrapib, a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor in development for the treatment of dyslipidemia. Two partially blinded, randomized, 2-period, fixed-sequence studies were performed. Safety, tolerability, and midazolam and anacetrapib plasma concentrations were assessed. All treatments were generally well tolerated. The geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of midazolam with anacetrapib/midazolam alone for AUC0-infinity and Cmax were 1.04 (0.94, 1.14) and 1.15 (0.97, 1.37), respectively. Exposure to anacetrapib was increased by ketoconazole--specifically, the geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) of anacetrapib with ketoconazole/anacetrapib alone for AUC0-infinity and Cmax were 4.58 (3.68, 5.71) and 2.37 (2.02, 2.78), respectively. The study showed that anacetrapib does not inhibit or induce CYP3A activity. Furthermore, anacetrapib appears to be a moderately sensitive substrate of CYP3A.",
