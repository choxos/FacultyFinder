  "title": "Are migration patterns and mortality related among European regions?",
  "abstract": "Geographical inequalities in mortality across Europe may be influenced by migration between regions. The relationship between age- and sex-standardised death rates, 2008-2010, and population change resulting from migration 2000-2010, was analysed in 250 'Nomenclature of Statistical Territorial Units' (NUTS) level 2 regions in 26 European countries. Across Europe death rates were significantly higher in regions experiencing population loss. This association continued after adjustment for 2005 household income among all regions and Western regions but not among Eastern areas. This analysis suggests migration could contribute to Europe's persistent inequalities in mortality, and highlights the problems of Eastern regions with the highest death rates, lowest incomes and declining populations.",
