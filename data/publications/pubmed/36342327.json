  "abstract": "Synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) joints mediate synovial hyperplasia, progressive joint destruction, and the potential spread of disease between joints by producing multiple pathogenic proteins. Here, we deliver all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) to selectively down-regulate these pathogenic factors, with a Golgi-targeting platelet microparticle-mimetic nanoplatform (termed Gol-PMMNP) which comprises a nanoparticle core and a platelet microparticle membrane coating labeled with a Golgi apparatus-targeting peptide. Gol-PMMNPs are shown to target synovial fibroblasts derived from RA patients via integrin α2β1-mediated endocytosis and accumulate in the Golgi apparatus by retrograde transport. ATRA-loaded Gol-PMMNPs (ATRA-Gol-PMMNPs) cause structural disruption of the Golgi apparatus, leading to an efficient reduction of pathogenic protein secretion in RA synovial fibroblasts. In rats with collagen-induced arthritis, Gol-PMMNPs display an arthritic joint-specific distribution, and ATRA-Gol-PMMNPs effectively reduce concentrations of pathogenic factors therein, including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and matrix-degrading enzymes within these joints. Additionally, ATRA-Gol-PMMNP treatment results in inflammatory remission and decreased bone erosion in both arthritic and proximal joints. Furthermore, ATRA-Gol-PMMNPs induce negligible toxicity to major organs. Taken together, ATRA-Gol-PMMNPs inhibit the progression of RA through reducing the production of multiple pathogenic mediators by synovial fibroblasts.",
