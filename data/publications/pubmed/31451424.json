  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Diet-related quality of life has not been explored previously in patients with type 2 diabetes using sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, the latest class of diabetes medications. In this study, we sought to describe the patient experience on SGLT-2 inhibitors and examine whether there have been improvements in dietary perception and satisfaction with these drugs. METHODS: Adults ≥40 years of age with type 2 diabetes and using SGLT-2 inhibitors for at least 1 month were recruited to take part in one-time 1-on-1 interviews. An interpretive descriptive methodology was used. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently and a constant comparative analysis was used. RESULTS: An overall positive response to SGLT-2 inhibitor use was observed. Interviews revealed 3 themes: Recognizing, Reckoning and Realizing. In Recognizing, all patients reported a significant relationship with food that was typically negative and included feelings of food restriction and deprivation. Positive side effects of the drug in Reckoning included better glycemic control, weight loss and improved energy. Some participants were motivated in Realizing to pursue additional behavioural changes to improve their diabetes management. CONCLUSIONS: An improved dietary-related quality of life was described by some participants. Although not all individuals were seen to move into the Realizing phase after initiating an SGLT-2 inhibitor, there appeared to be an opportunity to create a behaviour change after positive Reckoning experiences.",
