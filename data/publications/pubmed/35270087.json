  "title": "Response of Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) Genotypes to Heat Stress Using Morphological and Expression Study.",
  "abstract": "Due to unfavorable environmental conditions, heat stress is one of the significant production restrictions for the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) crop. The tomato crop is considered an important vegetable crop globally and represents a model plant for fruit development research. The heat shock factor (HSF) gene family contains plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are highly conserved and play a key role in plant high-temperature stress responses. The current study was designed to determine the relative response of heat stress under three different temperatures in the field condition to determine its relative heat tolerance. Furthermore, the study also characterized heat shock genes in eight tomato genotypes under different temperature regimes. The expressions of each gene were quantified using qPCR. The descriptive statistics results suggested a high range of diversity among the studied variables growing under three different temperatures. The qPCR study revealed that the SlyHSF genes play an important role in plant heat tolerance pathways. The expression patterns of HSF genes in tomatoes have been described in various tissues were determined at high temperature stress. The genes, SlyHSFs-1, SlyHSFs-2, SlyHSFs-8, SlyHSFs-9 recorded upregulation expression relative to SlyHSFs-3, SlyHSFs-5, SlyHSFs-10, and SlyHSFs-11. The genotypes, Strain B, Marmande VF, Pearson's early, and Al-Qatif-365 recorded the tolerant tomato genotypes under high-temperature stress conditions relative to other genotypes. The heat map analysis also confirmed the upregulation and downregulation of heat shock factor genes among the tomato genotypes. These genotypes will be introduced in the breeding program to improve tomato responses to heat stress.",
