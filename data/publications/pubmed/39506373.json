  "abstract": "Late-onset sepsis (LOS) in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) causes significant morbidity and mortality, yet guidance on empiric management is limited. We surveyed NICUs across Canada and the United States regarding their empiric antimicrobial regimens for LOS, thereby identifying large practice variations and high rates of empiric vancomycin use.",
