  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the current level of involvement of nurse practitioners (NPs) in activities related to preventing and managing fractures in long-term care (LTC). This study used a sequential explanatory mixed methods design that included two phases-a cross-sectional survey followed by qualitative interviews. A final sample of 12 NPs completed the online survey for a response rate of 67%. Eleven of the 12 NPs who completed the survey agreed to participate in a follow-up interview. NPs reported that they were quite engaged in managing fractures in LTC; specifically, they were most active in caring for residents post-fracture. NPs described their role as being holistic in nature in their assessment and treatments related to managing fractures. The findings from this mixed method study add to the growing body of knowledge related to how NPs manage fractures in LTC.",
