  "title": "Novel Method for the Synthesis of Hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] and Its Impact on Melanoma Cells In Vitro.",
  "abstract": "The ability to over-proliferate is a hallmark of cancer cells, so inhibiting proliferation is crucial for successful cancer treatment. Vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is among the factors necessary for replication of genetic material and cell division. There is currently no cobalamin antagonist with therapeutic use. Nevertheless, the idea of inhibiting cobalamin-dependent metabolic pathways as a potential anticancer strategy is of interest to many researchers. In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the impact of cobalamin deficiency on melanoma cells' growth. To achieve a cobalamin-deficient state in cellulo, hydroxycobalamin[c-lactam] was used as an antivitamin B12. Here, we describe a new and efficient method for synthesizing this analog from hydroxycobalamin. Interestingly, no cytostatic effect of cobalamin deficiency was observed on C32 and COLO 829 melanoma cell lines. However, we show the variously enhanced pro-proliferative action of vitamin B12 towards these cells. The presented experimental model can be used for further studies on the effects of the cobalamin status on melanoma cells.",
