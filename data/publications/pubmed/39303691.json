  "title": "Microbial colonization programs are structured by breastfeeding and guide healthy respiratory development.",
  "abstract": "Breastfeeding and microbial colonization during infancy occur within a critical time window for development, and both are thought to influence the risk of respiratory illness. However, the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of breastfeeding and the regulation of microbial colonization are poorly understood. Here, we profiled the nasal and gut microbiomes, breastfeeding characteristics, and maternal milk composition of 2,227 children from the CHILD Cohort Study. We identified robust colonization patterns that, together with milk components, predict preschool asthma and mediate the protective effects of breastfeeding. We found that early cessation of breastfeeding (before 3 months) leads to the premature acquisition of microbial species and functions, including Ruminococcus gnavus and tryptophan biosynthesis, which were previously linked to immune modulation and asthma. Conversely, longer exclusive breastfeeding supports a paced microbial development, protecting against asthma. These findings underscore the importance of extended breastfeeding for respiratory health and highlight potential microbial targets for intervention.",
