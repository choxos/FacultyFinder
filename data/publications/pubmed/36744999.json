  "title": "An evaluation of the clinical impacts of 7-day platelets.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In August 2017, Canadian Blood Services extended the shelf-life of platelet concentrates from 5 to 7 days. The clinical impacts of this policy change remain unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We used a before-after retrospective design of platelet-transfused adult inpatients in Hamilton, ON, Canada. Data were captured for 18 months before (Period 1: February 2016-July 2017) and 18 months after (Period 2: September 2017-February 2019) 7-day platelet implementation. Primary outcome was absolute platelet count increment (ACI) in univariate and multivariate analyses adjusted for confounders. Data were obtained from our institution's transfusion database, Ontario's Transfusion Transmitted Injuries Surveillance System, and the blood supplier. RESULTS: Overall, 1360 patients with single dose platelet transfusions were included in Period 1 and 1211 patients in Period 2. Median age at admission was 66 years, and approximately 40% of patients underwent cardiac surgery. Using a non-inferiority margin of -10 × 10[9] /L, platelets transfused during the 7-day storage period were non-inferior to those transfused in the 5-day storage period [mean count difference - 4.63 × 10[9] /L (95% CI -7.40 to -1.87, p = 0.0001)]. However, platelet ACIs following transfusion consistently trended lower in the 7-day group for all patients and subgroups. No differences in secondary clinical outcomes were observed. Platelet expiry reduced from 8.1 to 6.3% (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Platelet transfusions following 7-day storage policy were non-inferior to transfusions in the 5-day policy period, although reduced ACIs were observed. There were no increases in adverse clinical outcomes.",
