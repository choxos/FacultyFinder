  "title": "Annulation of CF3-Imidoyl Sulfoxonium Ylides with 1,3-Dicarbonyl Compounds: Access to 1,2,3-Trisubstituted 5-Trifluoromethylpyrroles.",
  "abstract": "A lithium-bromide-promoted nucleophilic substitution/annulation cascade reaction between CF3-imidoyl sulfoxonium ylides and 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds has been established, and the corresponding 1,2,3-trisubstituted 5-trifluoromethylpyrroles have been obtained in 27-78% yield. This reaction features a broad substrate scope and generates dimethyl sulfoxide and H2O as byproducts.",
