  "title": "Virtual connection, real support? A study of loneliness, time on social media and psychological distress among men.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In an age of increasing loneliness and associated poor mental health, research uncovering the extent to which social connection can be achieved digitally is paramount. This is particularly important among men, who experience unique barriers to achieving meaningful social connections due to masculine norms including independence and self-reliance. Loneliness is a known determinant of both psychological distress and greater time on social media, however relationships among these constructs are yet to be studied specifically among men. AIMS: This study aimed to examine a novel mediation model to uncover whether time on social media mediates the association between loneliness and psychological distress, alongside a moderating effect of age. METHOD: A community sample of 979 men of mean age 36.0 years (range = 18-78, SD = 13.11) took part via an online survey involving measures of study constructs. RESULTS: Results highlighted a novel moderated mediation effect: for younger men only, loneliness predicts psychological distress via time spent on social media. CONCLUSION: Men experiencing loneliness appear to turn to social media in attempt at digital connection, however for younger men in particular, often this fails to ameliorate links between loneliness and psychological distress. Implications for public health messaging, clinical work with men and future interventional studies are discussed.",
