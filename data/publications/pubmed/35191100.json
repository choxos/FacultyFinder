  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: There is limited data on the rate of new or recurrent cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and a history of prior or current malignancy who are initiated on biologic therapies. Furthermore, there is no data on this topic in patients using ustekinumab. METHODS: The retrospective study included 341 patients with IBD and a history of cancer who were subsequently treated with vedolizumab (VDZ; n = 34), ustekinumab (USK; n = 27), tumor necrosis factor α antagonists (anti-TNF; n = 99), or had no immunosuppressive therapy (control; n = 181). Cox proportional hazard models were developed to determine the independent effect of post-cancer immunosuppressive treatment on the occurrence of incident cancer. RESULTS: Over a median of 5.2 person-years of follow up, cancer recurrence occurred in only one patient on anti-TNF, while new cancers developed in one patient on VDZ, three patients on USK, and six patients on anti-TNF, corresponding to cancer rates of 0.4, 1.8, and 0.7 per 100 person-years, respectively. The rate of incident cancer in control patients was 2.4 per 100 person-years and included 18 new and 9 recurrent cancers. Compared with controls, a stepwise Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for significant covariates found no increased risk of incident cancer in patients receiving post-malignancy treatment with USK (hazard ratio [HR] 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.25-3.03), VDZ (HR 0.18; 95% CI 0.03-1.35), or anti-TNF (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.20-1.12). CONCLUSION: Use of biologic therapy in IBD patients with a previous history of malignancy was not associated with an increased risk of new or recurrent cancer.",
