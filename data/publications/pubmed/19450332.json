  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Pyelonephritis is usually caused by ascent of bacteria, most often Escherichia coli, from the bladder, and is more likely in people with structural or functional urinary tract abnormalities. The prognosis is good if pyelonephritis is treated appropriately, but complications include renal abscess, renal impairment, and septic shock. METHODS AND OUTCOMES: We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of: oral antibiotic treatments for acute pyelonephritis in women with uncomplicated infection; antibiotic treatments in women admitted to hospital with complicated infection; inpatient versus outpatient management in women with uncomplicated infection; analgesia in uncomplicated acute pyelonephritis? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to February 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). RESULTS: We found 5 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions. CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: analgesics, inpatient management, intravenous antibiotics, non-opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral antibiotics, outpatient management, urinary analgesics.",
