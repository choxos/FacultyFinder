  "title": "Effects of antioxidants on diabetic kidney diseases: mechanistic interpretations and clinical assessment.",
  "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is more prevalent with an increase in diabetes mellitus. Oxidative stress is a major factor in the occurrence and progression of DKD. Defending against oxidative stress and restoring antioxidant defense might be key to preventing and treating DKD. The purpose of this article is to provide an explanation of how oxidative stress affects DKD, conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on DKD, and examine the effect of antioxidants on the disease. An analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials showed that the use of antioxidants could reduce UAE (albumin excretion rate) in patients with DKD (SMD: - 0.31; 95% CI [- 0.47, - 0.14], I[2] = 0%), UACR (urine albumin/creatinine ratio) (SMD: - 0.60; 95% CI [- 1.15, - 0.06], I[2] = 89%), glycosylated hemoglobin (hbA1c) (MD: - 0.61; 95% CI [- 1.00, - 0.21], I[2] = 93%) and MDA (malonaldehyde) (SMD:-1.05; 95% CI [- 1.87, - 0.23], I[2] = 94%), suggesting that antioxidants seemed to have therapeutic effects in patients with DKD, especially in reducing proteinuria and hbA1c. The purpose of this study is to provide new targets and ideas for drug research and clinical treatment of DKD.",
