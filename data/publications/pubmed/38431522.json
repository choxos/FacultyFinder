  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study aims to describe the treatment patterns, outcomes, health care utilization and symptom burden of triple class exposed (TCE) relapsed/refractory patents with multiple myeloma (MM) receiving a subsequent line of treatment (LOT). METHODS: This is a retrospective observational cohort study using administrative databases in Ontario, Canada. Outcomes were captured for TCE patients receiving a subsequent LOT and included: treatment regimen details, time to next treatment (TTNT), overall survival (OS), health care utilization, palliative care referral, and patient reported symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 16,777 patients diagnosed with MM between 2007-2021 in Ontario, 1358 (8%) patients were classified as TCE. Among the TCE MM patients, 489 (36%) received a subsequent LOT. The two most commonly administered therapies post TCE were carfilzomib/dexamethasone (n = 111, 22%) and pomalidomide/dexamethasone(n = 95, 19%). Median TTNT was 1.7 months (95%CI 1.2-2.4 months) and median OS 12.8 months (95%CI 10.8-16.5). Healthcare utilization was high with 276 (56%) of patients evaluated in an emergency department (ED) or admitted to hospital. There was high symptom burden as reported by patients with moderate-severe impairment in well-being, fatigue, pain and drowsiness noted in greater than 25% of the cohort. Palliative care referrals rates were low with only 10% (n = 48) patients referred to palliative care. Among the patients that died during study follow up, the majority died in hospital (n = 147,44%). CONCLUSION: Our study reports one of the largest series of real-world TCE patients published and demonstrates the poor outcomes of TCE patients receiving a subsequent LOT.",
