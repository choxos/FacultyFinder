  "title": "Methodology for the Guidelines on Evaluation and Management of Hypoparathyroidism and Primary Hyperparathyroidism.",
  "abstract": "To develop guidelines for hypoparathyroidism and primary hyperparathyroidism, the panel assembled a panel of experts in parathyroid disorders, general endocrinologists, representatives of the Hypoparathyroidism Association, and systematic review and guideline methodologists. The guideline panel referred to a formal process following the Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) methodology to issue GRADEd recommendations. In this approach, panelists and methodologists formatted the questions, conducted systematic reviews, evaluated risk of bias, assessed certainty of evidence, and presented a summary of findings in a transparent fashion. For most recommendations, the task forces used a less structured approach largely based on narrative reviews to issue non-GRADEd recommendations. The panel issued Eight GRADEd recommendations (seven for hypoparathyroidism and one for hyperparathyroidism). Each GRADEd recommendation is linked to the underlying body of evidence and judgments regarding the certainty of evidence and strength of recommendations, values and preferences, and costs, feasibility, acceptability and equity. This article summarizes the methodology for issuing GRADEd and non-GRADEd recommendations for patients with hypoparathyroidism or hyperparathyroidism. Â© 2022 The Authors.
