  "title": "Body Contouring Surgery After Bariatric Surgery Improves Long-Term Health-Related Quality of Life and Satisfaction With Appearance: An International Longitudinal Cohort Study Using the BODY-Q.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine health-related quality of life (HRQL) and satisfaction with appearance in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery (BS) with or without subsequent body contouring surgery (BCS) in relation to the general population normative for the BODY-Q. BACKGROUND: The long-term impact of BS with or without BCS has not been established using rigorously developed and validated patient-reported outcome measures. The BODY-Q is a patient-reported outcome measure developed to measure changes in HRQL and satisfaction with appearance in patients with BS and BCS. METHODS: Prospective BODY-Q data were collected from 6 European countries (Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Italy, and Poland) from June 2015 to February 2022 in a cohort of patients who underwent BS. Mixed-effects regression models were used to analyze changes in HRQL and appearance over time between patients who did and did not receive BCS and to examine the impact of patient-level covariates on outcomes. RESULTS: This study included 24,604 assessments from 5620 patients. BS initially led to improved HRQL and appearance scores throughout the first postbariatric year, followed by a gradual decrease. Patients who underwent subsequent BCS after BS experienced a sustained improvement in HRQL and appearance or remained relatively stable for up to 10 years postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who underwent BCS maintained an improvement in HRQL and satisfaction with appearance in contrast to patients who only underwent BS, who reported a decline in scores 1 to 2 years postoperatively. Our results emphasize the pivotal role that BCS plays in the completion of the weight loss trajectory.",
