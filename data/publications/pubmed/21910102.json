  "title": "Peri-ictal urinary dysfunction in patients with epilepsy: a cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the prevalence of peri-ictal urinary symptoms and their association with seizure type in patients with epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 115 patients with epilepsy were recruited consecutively from neurology clinic between January 2006 and January 2008. Peri-ictal period was defined as the period ranging from 2 minutes prior to seizure attack up to 48 hours after it, and post-ictal period was the time up to 48 hours after regaining consciousness. Peri-ictal urinary complaints were gathered with interview and data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi-square, Fisher's Exact test, and independent sample t test. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 57 (49.5%) men and 58 (50.4%) women, with the mean age of 26.83 Â± 10.01 years. The frequency of at least one urinary symptom in studied patients was 39.1%. Incontinence, frequency, urgency, retention, and hesitancy were reported by 28 (24.3%), 14 (12.2%), 19 (16.5%), 10 (8.7%), and 8 (7%) patients, respectively. Women expressed more symptoms than men and a higher frequency of peri-ictal retention. Although overall urinary complaints were more frequent in patients with partial seizures, there was a higher frequency of urgency in patients with partial seizure (P = .037). Furthermore, apart from retention, there was no significant correlation between peri-ictal urinary symptoms and the patients' age. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that peri-ictal urologic dysfunction is a common problem among patients with epilepsy and post-ictal urinary retention might also be considered as a post-ictal deficit (Todd's deficit).",
