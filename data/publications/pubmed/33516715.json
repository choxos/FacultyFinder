  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study reports resource use and economic implications of rhythm monitoring with subcutaneous cardiac rhythm monitors (SCRMs). BACKGROUND: SCRMs generate a substantial amount of data that requires timely adjudication for appropriate clinical care. Resource use for SCRM monitoring is not known. METHODS: The study included consecutive transmissions during 4 weeks from 1,811 SCRMs. Resource use was quantified by assessment of time commitment of device clinic personnel and electrophysiologists for data adjudication. Incidence and characteristics of false positive (FP) episodes were assessed. Impact of custom programming for arrhythmia detection on incidence of FP episodes and resource use was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 1,457 transmissions (alerts = 462; full downloads = 995) were received during study period. Average device clinic personnel time for adjudication of 1 transmission was 15 ± 6 min. This totaled to 364 h spent (2.3 full-time staff) over the 4-week period, which translated into a salary cost of $12,000 U.S. dollars (USD). Average time spent by an electrophysiologist for 1 transmission was 1.5 ± 1 min and totaled to 37 h for 4 weeks, which translated into an estimated cost of $9,600 USD. Of 1,457 total transmissions, 512 (35%) represented multiple transmissions from the same patients, which resulted in no additional reimbursement. Incidence of FP episodes in the entire cohort was 50% and was variable in alert (60%) and full download (49%) (p = 0.04) transmissions. When SCRMs with manufacturer suggested nominal programming and institutional custom programming were compared, there was a reduction in FP episodes (55% vs. 16%; p = 0.01), which translated to a 34% reduction in resource use for data adjudication. CONCLUSIONS: SCRM data adjudication requires significant resources. Custom programming for SCRMs may overcome the data deluge.",
