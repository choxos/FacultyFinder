  "title": "Why do queer men experience negative body image? A narrative review and testable stigma model.",
  "abstract": "Queer men (i.e., men who are not heterosexual; sexual minority men) are disproportionately affected by negative body image - they experience greater body dissatisfaction are more likely to develop eating disorders than heterosexual men. While existing literature has examined individual-level predictors of negative body image for queer men, less is known about why queer men as a group are disproportionately affected by negative body image. By synthesising existing theoretical frameworks, research, policy, and media reporting, this narrative review moves towards an understanding of systemic-level negative body image for queer men. Through the lens of hegemonic masculinity, we explain how systemic experiences of stigma work to inform unattainable appearance standards for queer men, and how these standards then contribute to pervasive negative body image concerns among this community. Next, we describe how systemic stigma works to exacerbate negative health outcomes for queer men with body image concerns. Finally, we present a synthesized model of the processes outlined in this review, articulate testable predictions for future studies, and describe practical implications that could be widely employed to improve body image for queer men. Our review is the first to propose a comprehensive explanation of systemic negative body image for queer men.",
