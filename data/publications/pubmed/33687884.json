  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is frequently employed for the assessment of therapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients. Nonetheless, this technique has its limitations, the most apparent being the inability to differentiate between after therapy effects and the reoccurrence of tumor cells. OBJECTIVE: This review was carried out to demonstrate the role of operative MRI in the treatment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients, as well as the analysis of various methods like diffusion, perfusion, and spectroscopy when used in conjugation. MAIN FINDINGS: Techniques such as diffusion-weighted imaging can augment the reliability of the detection of the main tumor site and local lymphatic nodes post-treatment. It was observed that diffusion is the most facile of the methods in question and can be easily implemented in follow-up sessions after therapy, though the evidential information is sometimes insufficient to validate. Perfusion factors may become elevated in the proliferation of tumors or their reoccurrence, but they are not employed for their accuracy in clinical settings. Spectroscopy methods pose some potential, but the case is the same as diffusion; insufficient data cannot be deemed enough to validate its application. CONCLUSION: These operative MRI methods can significantly help in the initial discernment of disease, thereby resulting in an improved therapeutic approach in patients. Prospective studies are necessary to layout standard specifications for using operative MRI in routine clinical applications.",
