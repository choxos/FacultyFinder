  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) presenting in primary care. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for studies in primary care that provided information on clinical features predictive of CRC. Positive predictive values were used to guide the determination of clinical features associated with increased risk of CRC. STUDY SELECTION: Systematic reviews or primary studies that provided possible clinical features predictive of CRC were included. SYNTHESIS: Clinical features of patients presenting in primary care that are associated with increased risk of CRC, listed in descending order of association, included palpable rectal or abdominal mass; rectal bleeding combined with weight loss; iron deficiency anemia; rectal bleeding mixed with stool; rectal bleeding in the absence of perianal symptoms; rectal bleeding combined with change in bowel habits; dark rectal bleeding; rectal bleeding and diarrhea; and change in bowel habits. Being male and increasing age were also, in general, associated with increased risk of CRC. CONCLUSION: Recognition of clinical features associated with increased risk of CRC by FPs might help with earlier identification and referral among patients presenting in primary care. This review might help inform providers and CRC diagnostic assessment programs about indications for assessment and further investigation.",
