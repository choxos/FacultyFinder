  "title": "Chemical-Modified Nucleotide-Based Elemental Tags for High-Sensitive Immunoassay.",
  "abstract": "Multiplex biomolecular analysis with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) becomes increasingly important in clinical diagnosis and single cell analysis. However, the sensitivity of ICP-MS-based immunoassay is only comparable or lower than those of fluorescence methods at the present stage. Therefore, designing elemental tags with a large number of metal atoms is necessary to achieve high-sensitive detection. In this work, we proposed a new strategy to build up elemental tag loading with hundreds of rare earth ions by coupling alkyne-DNA chains with rare earth element (REE)-DOTA complexes a click chemistry reaction. There are about 2 orders of magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared with single metal-ion tags. DNA chains with multialkynyl groups were facilely prepared by PCR synthesis. Moreover, the DNA-based elemental tags own excellent water-solubility and biocompatibility. The tags would be potentially applied to mass cytometry and clinical diagnosis.",
