  "title": "Direct localisation of the human pedunculopontine nucleus using MRI: a coordinate and fibre-tracking study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To image the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPN), a deep brain stimulation (DBS) target for Parkinson disease, using MRI with validated results. METHODS: This study used the MP2RAGE sequence with high resolution and enhanced grey-white matter contrast on a 7-T ultra-high-field MRI system to image the PPN as well as a diffusion spectrum imaging method on a 3-T MRI system to reconstruct the main fibre systems surrounding the PPN. The coordinates of the rostral and caudal PPN poles of both sides were measured in relation to the third and fourth ventricular landmarks on the 7-T image. RESULTS: The boundary of the PPN was delineated, and showed morphology consistent with previous histological works. The main fibres around the PPN were reconstructed. The pole coordinate results combined with the fibre spatial relationships validate the imaging results. CONCLUSIONS: A practical protocol is provided to directly localise the PPN using MRI; the position and morphology of the PPN can be obtained and validated by locating its poles relative to two ventricular landmarks and by inspecting its spatial relationship with the surrounding fibre systems. This technique can be potentially used in clinics to define the boundary of the PPN before DBS surgery for treatment of Parkinson disease in a more precise and reliable manner. KEY POINTS: • Combined information helps localise the PPN as a DBS target for PD patients • Scan the PPN at 7 T and measure its coordinates against different ventricular landmarks • Reconstruct the main fibres around the PPN using diffusion spectrum imaging.",
