  "title": "Establishing Reliability and Validity of the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module for Pediatric Head and Neck Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to establish content validity and assess the psychometric properties of the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module, a patient-reported outcome measure, for use in pediatric and adolescent patients with head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods: To establish content validity (Part 1), between June 2017 and August 2019, cognitive interviews were conducted with survivors of pediatric HNC (n = 15), and input was obtained from clinical experts (n = 21). To examine item and scale performance (Part 2), Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT) analysis was performed using data from two international studies (n = 121). Results: Part 1: Qualitative data from 15 survivors and input from 21 experts provided evidence to support the use of the FACE-Q Craniofacial Module in pediatric HNC. Part 2: The field-test study sample included 121 survivors of pediatric HNC. RMT analysis provided evidence of reliability and validity for 10 FACE-Q scales. Data for each scale fit the RMT model. Scale reliability was high, with Person Separation Index and Cronbach's alpha values â‰¥0.82 for 9 scales. Mean scores on the Appearance, Psychological, and Social scales were higher for those who liked aspects of their face more. For participants with (vs. without) a facial difference, mean scores were lower for the Face, Jaws, Psychological, and Social scales. Conclusion: The FACE-Q Craniofacial Module evidenced reliability and validity for HNC survivors aged 8-29 years and can be used in research and clinical care to measure quality of life of pediatric survivors with HNC.",
