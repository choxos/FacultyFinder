  "title": "Bioavailability and Toxicity of nano Copper Oxide to Pakchoi (Brassica Campestris L.) as Compared with bulk Copper Oxide and Ionic Copper.",
  "abstract": "The increasing use of copper oxide nano particles (nCuO) as nano-fertilizers and pesticides have raised concerns over their impact on soil environment and agricultural products. In this study, two nCuO with different shapes, namely spherical nCuO (CuO NPs) and tubular nCuO (CuO NTs), were selected to investigate their bioavailability and toxicity to pakchoi in two soils with different properties. At the meantime, CuO bulk particles (CuO BPs) and Cu(NO3)2 were used for comparison. Results showed that all the Cu treatments increased the DTPA extractable (DTPA-Cu) concentrations in GD soil (acidic) more than in HN soil (alkaline). The DTPA-Cu concentrations increased in the order of Cu(NO3)2 ≈ CuO NPs > CuO BPs ≈ CuO NTs in GD soil and Cu(NO3)2 > CuO NPs > CuO BPs ≈ CuO NTs in HN soil. While for the contents of Cu in the aerial parts of pakchoi, the order is CuO NPs > Cu(NO3)2 > CuO NTs ≈ CuO BPs in GD soil and CuO NPs ≈ Cu(NO3)2 > CuO BPs ≈ CuO NTs in HN soil. Only CuO NPs reduced pakchoi biomass in GD soil. There are no significant difference among CuO NPs, CuO BPs, and Cu(NO3)2 in reducing the chlorophyll contents in pakchoi in HN soil, whereas in GD soil, CuO NPs and CuO BPs led to significantly lower chlorophyll contents in pakchoi compared to Cu(NO3)2. Additionally, CuO NPs and Cu(NO3)2 increased Mn and Mo in pakchoi leaf in HN soil, while increased Zn in pakchoi leaf in GD soil. These results indicated that CuO NPs showed higher or comparable toxicity and bioavailability to pakchoi compared with Cu(NO3)2 depending on soil properties, and nCuO are more easily to be transferred from roots to the aerial parts than CuO BPs and Cu(NO3)2.",
