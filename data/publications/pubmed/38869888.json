  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: The role of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for gynecologic malignant tumors has yet to be clearly defined despite recent clinical uptake. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the outcomes of SABR in patients with oligometastatic and oligoprogressive gynecologic cancers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective pooled analysis, patients with oligometastatic and oligoprogressive gynecologic cancers receiving SABR at 5 institutions from Canada and the US were studied. Data were collected from January 2011 to December 2020, and data were analyzed from January to December 2023. EXPOSURE: Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of local and distant recurrence, chemotherapy-free survival (CFS), and overall survival (OS) probabilities after SABR were calculated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Univariable and multivariable analysis was conducted using Cox regression methods. RESULTS: A total of 215 patients with 320 lesions meeting criteria were included in the analysis; the median (range) age at primary diagnosis was 59 (23-86) years. The median (range) follow-up from SABR was 18.5 (0.1-124.5) months. The primary site included the endometrium (n = 107), ovary (n = 64), cervix (n = 30), and vulva or vagina (n = 14). Local cumulative incidence of recurrence was 13.7% (95% CI, 9.4-18.9) and 18.5% (95% CI, 13.2-24.5) at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Distant cumulative incidence of recurrence was 48.5% (95% CI, 41.4-55.1) and 73.1% (95% CI, 66.0-79.0) at 1 and 5 years, respectively. OS was 75.7% (95% CI, 69.2-81.1) and 33.1% (95% CI, 25.3-41.1) at 1 and 5 years, respectively. The median CFS was 21.7 months (95% CI, 15.4-29.9). On multivariable analysis, local recurrence was significantly associated with nodal metastasis, lesion size, biologically effective dose, treatment indication, institution, and primary disease type. Distant progression-free survival was associated with nodal targets and lesion size. OS and CFS were significantly associated with lesion size. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, SABR appeared to have excellent local control with minimal toxic effects in this large patient group, and certain patients may achieve durable distant control and OS as well. It may be possible to delay time to chemotherapy in select patient subtypes and therefore reduce associated toxic effects. Prospective multicenter trials will be critical to establish which characteristics procure the greatest benefit from SABR use and to define the ideal time to implement SABR with other oncologic treatments.",
