  "title": "Surgical interventions for external snapping hip syndrome.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Snapping hip is a common clinical condition, characterized by an audible or palpable snap of the hip joint. When the snap is perceived at the lateral side of the hip, this condition is known as external snapping hip or lateral coxa saltans, which is usually asymptomatic. Snapping hip syndrome (SHS) refers to a painful snap, which is more common in athletes who require increased hip range of motion. The aim of this article is to review the most common endoscopic techniques for the treatment of ESHS, as well as their results and limitations. METHODS: This is a review of the current literature of endoscopic surgical procedures and of the results of the treatment of external snapping hip syndrome. RESULTS: The pathogenesis of SHS is mechanical. The initial treatment attempt is conservative, and usually provides good results. Patients who do not respond to conservative management are candidate for surgery. The endoscopic release of the ilio-tibial band or the endoscopic release of the femoral insertion of the gluteus maximum tendon is the most popular technique. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic techniques provide fewer complications compared to open surgery, a lower recurrence rate and good clinical outcomes. More comparative studies with a longer follow-up are required to adequate evaluate the full role of endoscopic techniques in periarticular hip surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level V.",
