  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive and behavioral deficits. Donepezil and memantine are two medications used to treat the symptoms of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. A modeled cost-effectiveness analysis found that treatment with donepezil to be less costly and more effective than no treatment or treatment with memantine in Germany. However, the model drew on non-German population data and could have been more transparent with regard to 'back-end' processes. In addition, the authors would question the extent to which the differences in effectiveness between treatments would be considered clinically significant. Identifying sources of cost savings for donepezil remains an important issue for future consideration.",
