  "title": "A procedure for high-yield spore production by Bacillus subtilis.",
  "abstract": "Bacillus subtilis spores have a number of potential applications, which include their use as probiotics and competitive exclusion agents to control zoonotic pathogens in animal production. The effect of cultivation conditions on Bacillus subtilis growth and sporulation was investigated in batch bioreactions performed at a 2-L scale. Studies of the cultivation conditions (pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, and media composition) led to an increase of the maximum concentration of vegetative cell from 2.6 x 10(9) to 2.2 x 10(10) cells mL(-)(1) and the spore concentration from 4.2 x 10(8) to 5.6 x 10(9) spores mL(-)(1). A fed-batch bioprocess was developed with the addition of a nutrient feeding solution using an exponential feeding profile obtained from the mass balance equations. Using the developed feeding profile, starting at the middle of the exponential growth phase and finishing in the late exponential phase, an increase of the maximum vegetative cell concentration and spore concentration up to 3.6 x 10(10) cells mL(-)(1) and 7.4 x 10(9) spores mL(-)(1), respectively, was obtained. Using the developed fed-batch bioreaction a 14-fold increase in the concentration of the vegetative cells was achieved. Moreover, the efficiency of sporulation under fed-batch bioreaction was 21%, which permitted a 19-fold increase in the final spore concentration, to a final value of 7.4 x 10(9) spores mL(-)(1). This represents a 3-fold increase relative to the highest reported value for Bacillus subtilis spore production.",
