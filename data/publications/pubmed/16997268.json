  "abstract": "A combined school- and community-based campaign targeting the entire school-age population of Burkina Faso with drugs against schistosomiasis (praziquantel) and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (albendazole) was implemented in 2004-2005. In total, 3,322,564 children from 5 to 15 years of age were treated, equivalent to a 90.8% coverage of the total school-age population of the country. The total costs of the campaign were estimated to be US 1,067,284 dollars, of which 69.4% was spent on the drugs. Delivery costs per child treated were US 0.098 dollar, in the same range as school-based only interventions implemented in other countries; total costs per child treated (including drugs) were US 0.32 dollar. We conclude that a combined school- and community-based strategy is effective in attaining a high coverage among school-age children in countries where school enrolment is low and where primary schools cannot serve as the exclusive drug distribution points. The challenge for Burkina Faso will now be to ensure the sustainability of these disease control activities.",
