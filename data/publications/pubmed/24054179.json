  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although anecdotal evidence suggests that the risk of recurrent gout attack increases with hospitalization, no study has formally tested this hypothesis. METHODS: We conducted an online case-crossover study of individuals with gout. We obtained information on gout attacks over a 1-year period, including onset date, symptoms and signs, medications, and exposure to potential risk factors, including hospitalization, during the 2-day hazard period before each gout attack. The same exposure information also was obtained over 2-day intercritical gout control periods. We performed conditional logistic regression to examine the relationship of hospitalization with recurrent gout attacks and whether such a relationship was modified by concomitant use of anti-gout medications. RESULTS: Of 724 participants (mean age, 54.5 years; 78.5% male), 35 hospitalizations occurred during a hazard or control period. The adjusted odds of gout attacks was increased 4-fold with hospitalization (odds ratio, 4.05; 95% confidence interval, 1.78-9.19) compared with no hospitalization. The effect of hospitalization tended to attenuate with the use of allopurinol, colchicine, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but not statistically significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirmed that the risk of gout attacks increases among patients with gout during hospitalization. Appropriate measures should be considered for prevention of gout attacks during hospitalization for patients with preexisting gout.",
