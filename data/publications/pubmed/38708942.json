  "title": "Profound Coronary Vasospasm Associated with Intraoperative Ketamine Administration: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "We report a case of a 62-year-old woman with a decade-long history of atypical chest pain resulting in a largely negative cardiac workup, who developed significant angiographically demonstrated coronary vasospasm thought to be due to a small dose of intravenous ketamine. In patients with a history of atypical chest pain despite a reassuring cardiac evaluation, providers should carefully consider medications that may precipitate coronary vasospasm and be prepared to treat it accordingly.",
