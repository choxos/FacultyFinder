  "title": "Sclerosing Encapsulating Peritonitis in a Pediatric Patient Treated With Cytoreductive Surgery and Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a rare chronic inflammatory condition characterized by small bowel encapsulation by a thick fibrocollagenous membrane. Patients with SEP often present with nonspecific symptoms, such as abdominal pain and distension, however some patients may present with symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Secondary SEP has been reported in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and has been recently described in adults following cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC). OBSERVATIONS: We report a clinical case of a 13-year-old female who presented with worsening abdominal pain and distension and persistent emesis who was found to have SEP 13 months following CRS and HIPEC for management of desmoplastic small round cell tumor and subsequently required operative intervention. CONCLUSION: Although there have been published reports of adult patients experiencing cases of SEP following CRS/HIPEC, this is the first published case of secondary SEP occurring in a pediatric oncology patient.",
