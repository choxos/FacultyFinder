  "abstract": "A term male infant was born to a healthy 24-year-old mother with antenatally diagnosed liver-up, left congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and gastroschisis. The infant was stabilised in the neonatal intensive care unit and then underwent primary repair of the CDH via left subcostal incision and silo placement for the gastroschisis. Serial silo reductions were started postoperatively and umbilical flap closure for the gastroschisis was performed on day of life 6. The patient was weaned from respiratory support, started on enteral feeds, and discharged home at 1 month of age. He was weaned from supplemental nasogastric feeds by 6 weeks of age and is currently well and thriving at 11 months of age.",
