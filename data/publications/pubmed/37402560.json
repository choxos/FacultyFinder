  "title": "Evidence-based treatment of Achilles tendon rupture.",
  "abstract": "The treatment of Achilles tendon rupture has recently seen a shift toward non-operative management, as supported by the literature, yet many surgeons continue to treat these injuries operatively. The evidence clearly supports non-operative management of these injuries except for Achilles insertional tears and for certain patient groups, such as athletic patients, for whom further research is warranted. This nonadherence to evidence-based treatment may be explained by patient preference, surgeon subspecialty, surgeon era of practice or other variables. Further research to understand the reasons behind this nonadherence would help to promote conformity in the surgical community across all specialties and adherence to evidence-based approaches.",
