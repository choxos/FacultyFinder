  "title": "Stimulus-Responsive Four-Stranded DNA Nanoring Assembly to Host Multiple Nanosilver Clusters for Cooperatively Enhanced Fluorescence Biosensing.",
  "abstract": "Exploring the ability of four-stranded DNA nanorings (fsDNRs) to host multiple nanosilver clusters (NAgCs) for cooperatively amplifiable fluorescence biosensing to a specific initiator (tI*) is fascinating. By designing three DNA single strands and three analogous stem-loop hairpins, we developed a functional fsDNR through sequential cross-opening and overlapped hybridization. Note that a substrate strand (SS) was programmed with six modules: two severed splits (sT and sT') of NAgCs template, two sequestered segments by a middle unpaired spacer, and a partition for tI*-recognizable displacement, while sT and sT' were also tethered in two ends of three hairpins. At first, a triple dsDNA complex with stimulus-responsiveness was formed to guide the specific binding to tI*, while the exposed toehold of the SS activated the forward cascade hybridization of three hairpins, until the ring closure in the tailored self-assembly pathway for forming the fsDNR. The resulting four duplexes forced each pair of sT/sT' to be merged as the parent template in four nicks, guiding the preferential synthesis of four clusters in the shared fsDNR, thereby cooperatively amplifying the green fluorescence signal for sensitive assay of tI*. Meanwhile, the topological conformation of fsDNR can be stabilized by the as-formed cluster adducts to rivet the pair of two splits in the nicks. Benefitting from the self-enhanced effect of multiple emitters, this label-free fluorescent sensing strategy features simplicity, rapidity, and high on-off contrast, without involving complicated nucleic acid amplifiers.",
