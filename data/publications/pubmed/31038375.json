  "abstract": "Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia is a rare but often lethal genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 10,000 people. It often first manifests as stress or exercise-related syncope or sudden unexplained cardiac death, primarily in the pediatric and young adult population. We present a case of a 6-year-old male who had a sudden unexplained prehospital cardiac arrest after being scared by a domestic animal and who presented in ventricular fibrillation. The patient was subsequently defibrillated with a return of spontaneous circulation. During the course of care, medications with beta-1 and -2 agonist properties were administered, followed by multiple further episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT)/ventricular fibrillation (VF). Once these medications were discontinued and beta blockers were administered, the patient had no further episodes of PVT/VF and was subsequently discharged from hospital 7 days later, completely neurologically intact. This case suggests the need for caution when considering administering beta agonists in a pediatric cardiac arrest patient with no known history of heart disease who presents in VF or PVT after an incident of extreme stress or strenuous physical activity.",
