  "title": "Transarterial Radioembolization Treatment as a Bridge to Surgical Resection in Pediatric Hepatocellular Carcinoma.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have a poor prognosis and limited treatment options. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) using Yttrium-90 (Y90) has emerged as a potential bridge therapy to hepatic resection or transplantation for HCC with very limited studies in children. OBSERVATIONS: Here we present the clinical course of 2 children successfully treated with TARE Y90 for initially unresectable fibrolamellar HCC (FL-HCC) and bridged to partial hemihepatectomy with >1-year overall survival post-TARE. CONCLUSION: Although there have been prior published reports of pediatric patients with HCC being treated with TARE Y90 and some being able to undergo subsequent orthotopic liver transplantation, this is the first report of pediatric HCC patients treated with TARE Y90 as a bridge to nontransplant resections and going on to have >1-year overall survival.",
