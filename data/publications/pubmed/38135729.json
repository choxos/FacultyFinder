  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This systematic review was performed to characterize the landscape of research conducted in patients with intestinal stoma (IS) and highlight unmet needs for clinical research in Crohn's disease (CD) and IS. METHODS: We searched ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to May 25, 2022, to identify clinical trials assessing interventions in patients with an IS, as well as those with an IS and CD. Studies were grouped according to type of intervention. We excluded observational studies with no treatment arm. RESULTS: A total of 253 studies were included in the final analysis. Most studies investigated devices (n = 122 [48.2%]), or surgical procedures (n = 63 [24.9%]), followed by behavioral interventions (n = 30 [11.8%]), drugs (n = 20 [7.9%]), dietary interventions (n = 2 [0.8%]), skin care products (n = 2 0.8%]), and others (n = 14 [5.5%]). A total of 50.9% (n = 129) of studies had completed recruitment, enrolling 11 116 participants. Only 6 studies (surgery: n = 3; physiological studies: n = 2; drugs: n = 1) exclusively included patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and 16 studies commented that patients with IBD were excluded in their eligibility criteria. No study assessed efficacy of drugs in patients with CD and IS. Approximately one-quarter of studies (n = 65 of 253) included quality of life as an outcome measure. CONCLUSION: There is a paucity of research in IBD patients with IS, with the majority focusing on devices and surgical procedures. There have been no drug trials evaluating efficacy in patients with CD and IS. There is an urgent need to identify barriers to enrollment and develop eligibility and outcome measures that enable the inclusion of patients with CD with stoma into clinical trials.",
