  "abstract": "Direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) vary in bioavailability and sites of absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Data on DOAC use after major GIT surgery are limited. The aim of this case series was to report the impact of surgical resection or bypass of the GIT on rivaroxaban and apixaban peak plasma concentrations. This was a case series of patients who received rivaroxaban or apixaban after GIT surgery, during the period of July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2020. Peak plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban and apixaban were assessed for the expected concentrations. Of the 27 assessed patients, 18 (66.7%) received rivaroxaban, and 9 (33.3%) received apixaban. After rivaroxaban therapy, 4 of 5 patients (80%) who underwent gastrectomy, and 3 of 3 patients (100%) who underwent duodenum and proximal jejunum exclusion had peak plasma concentrations of rivaroxaban lower than the effective range, whereas 11 of 11 patients (100%) who underwent distal bowel or ileostomy had peak rivaroxaban plasma within the effective range. After apixaban therapy, 5 of 6 patients (83.3%) who underwent total or partial gastrectomy achieved effective peak concentrations. All the patients who underwent proximal and distal bowel resection or bypass had peak concentrations of apixaban within the effective range. In conclusion, surgical resection or bypass of the upper GIT could affect DOAC absorption and subsequently peak plasma concentrations. This effect was more observed among rivaroxaban recipients. An injectable anticoagulant or vitamin K antagonist may be preferred if DOAC concentrations cannot be measured after GIT surgery.",
