  "title": "Implementing a National Nursing and Midwifery Digital Health Capability Framework: Exploring Knowledge, Experience in Informatics and Barriers and Enablers.",
  "abstract": "A National Nursing and Midwifery Digital Health Capability Framework was developed in 2020 to define and complement digital health knowledge and skills for professional practice. This mixed-methods study explored nurses' and midwives' Framework knowledge and its applicability, types and extent of nursing and midwifery informatics roles, and barriers and enablers to working in informatics. Survey respondents reported familiarity with the Framework, with content analysis identifying three themes - informatics as part of nursing or midwifery roles, descriptions and variability of informatics roles, and the need for informatics role development and recognition. Framework knowledge can be improved through standardised and defined roles and a career pathway that includes national, organisational, local, and individual support.",
