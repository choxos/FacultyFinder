  "title": "Development and Feasibility of a Primary Care Provider Training Intervention to Improve Atrial Fibrillation Management.",
  "abstract": "The disparities in atrial fibrillation (AF) care are partially attributed to inadequate access to providers with specialized training in AF. Primary care providers (PCPs) are often the sole providers of AF care in under-resourced regions. As such, we sought to create a virtual education intervention for PCPs and to evaluate its impact on the use of stroke risk reduction strategies in patients with AF. A multidisciplinary team mentored PCPs on AF management over 6 months using a virtual case-based training format. Surveys of participant knowledge and confidence in AF care were compared before and after the intervention. Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to evaluate change in oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy in the patients seen by participants before or after training. Of 41 participants trained, 49% worked in family medicine, 41% internal medicine, and 10% general cardiology. Participants attended a mean of 14 1-hour sessions. Overall, the appropriate use of OAC (for CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥1 man, ≥2 women) increased from 37% to 46% (p <0.001) comparing the patients seen before (n = 1,739) versus after (n = 610) intervention. The factors independently associated with appropriate OAC use included participant training (odds ratio [OR] 1.4, p = 0.002) and participant competence in AF management. The factors associated with decreased OAC use included patient age (OR 0.8 per 10 year, p = 0.008) and nonwhite race (OR 0.7, p = 0.028). Provider knowledge and confidence in AF care improved (p <0.001). In conclusion, we show that a virtual PCP training intervention improves the use of stroke risk reduction therapy in outpatients with AF and could be a widely scalable intervention to improve AF care in under-resourced communities.",
