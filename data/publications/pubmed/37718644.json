  "title": "Sequential detection of inflammation-related hypochlorite ions and viscosity with a relay fluorescent probe.",
  "abstract": "Based on the correlation between inflammation and reactive oxygen species and viscosity, a fluorescent probe (SWJT-19) was designed for a relay detection of hypochlorite ions and viscosity. The synthesized probe could quickly and selectively detect hypochlorite ions, as well as viscosity of the system effectively. Moreover, the probe had been successfully applied to sequentially detect hypochlorite ions and viscosity in organisms, as well as imaging in mouse inflammation.",
