  "title": "Evaluating Multiple Next-Generation Sequencing-Derived Tumor Features to Accurately Predict DNA Mismatch Repair Status.",
  "abstract": "Identifying tumor DNA mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR) is important for precision medicine. Tumor features, individually and in combination, derived from whole-exome sequenced (WES) colorectal cancers (CRCs) and panel-sequenced CRCs, endometrial cancers (ECs), and sebaceous skin tumors (SSTs) were assessed for their accuracy in detecting dMMR. CRCs (n = 300) with WES, where mismatch repair status was determined by immunohistochemistry, were assessed for microsatellite instability (MSMuTect, MANTIS, MSIseq, and MSISensor), Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer tumor mutational signatures, and somatic mutation counts. A 10-fold cross-validation approach (100 repeats) evaluated the dMMR prediction accuracy for i) individual features, ii) Lasso statistical model, and iii) an additive feature combination approach. Panel-sequenced tumors (29 CRCs, 22 ECs, and 20 SSTs) were assessed for the top performing dMMR predicting features/models using these three approaches. For WES CRCs, 10 features provided >80% dMMR prediction accuracy, with MSMuTect, MSIseq, and MANTIS achieving â‰¥99% accuracy. The Lasso model achieved 98.3% accuracy. The additive feature approach, with three or more of six of MSMuTect, MANTIS, MSIseq, MSISensor, insertion-deletion count, or tumor mutational signature small insertion/deletion 2 + small insertion/deletion 7 achieved 99.7% accuracy. For the panel-sequenced tumors, the additive feature combination approach of three or more of six achieved accuracies of 100%, 95.5%, and 100% for CRCs, ECs, and SSTs, respectively. The microsatellite instability calling tools performed well in WES CRCs; however, an approach combining tumor features may improve dMMR prediction in both WES and panel-sequenced data across tissue types.",
