  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The optimal target for glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) has not been well defined in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The objective of our study was to examine the predictive value of predialysis and time-averaged follow-up HbA1c values on technique and patient survival in diabetic PD patients treated in the Toronto General Hospital Home Peritoneal Dialysis Unit, between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2008 with a median follow-up period of 30±23 months. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (mean age 64±13 years-old) were included in this retrospective study. Patients were followed between 3 and 91 months (mean duration 30±23 months). During this period, 40 patients died. We found no statistically significant correlation between baseline predialysis HbA1c values and technique and patient survival. Time-averaged follow-up HbA1c in increments<6.5%, 6.5-8%, and >8% showed no significant survival difference among groups. CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant correlation of baseline and time-averaged follow-up HbA1c values with patient and PD technique survival.",
