  "abstract": "To realize high-energy-density Li metal batteries at low temperatures, a new electrolyte is needed to solve the high-voltage compatibility and fast lithium-ion de-solvation process. A gel polymer electrolyte with a small-molecular-weight polymer is widely investigated by combining the merits of a solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) and liquid electrolyte (LE). Herein, we present a new gel polymer electrolyte (P-DOL) by the lithium difluoro(oxalate)borate (LiDFOB)-initiated polymerization process using 1,3-dioxolane (DOL) as a monomer solvent. The P-DOL presents excellent ionic conductivity (1.12 × 10[-4] S cm[-1]) at -20 °C, with an oxidation potential of 4.8 V. The Li‖LiCoO2 cell stably cycled at 4.3 V under room temperature, with a discharge capacity of 130 mAh g[-1] at 0.5 C and a capacity retention rate of 86.4% after 50 cycles. Moreover, a high-Ni-content LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cell can steadily run for 120 cycles at -20 °C, with a capacity retention of 88.4%. The underlying mechanism of high-voltage compatibility originates from the dense and robust B- and F-rich cathode interface layer (CEI) formed at the cathode interface. Our report will shed light on the real application of Li metal batteries under all-climate conditions in the future.",
