  "abstract": "The effectiveness of multidisciplinary care (MDC) in improving health outcomes for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is uncertain. This study sought to determine the association among MDC, survival, and risk for hospitalization among elderly outpatients with CKD. A total of 6978 patients who were 66 yr and older and had CKD were identified between July 1 and December 31, 2001, and followed to December 31, 2004; 187 (2.7%) were followed in an MDC clinic. Logistic regression was used to determine the propensity score (probability of MDC) for each patient, and MDC and non-MDC patients then were matched 1:1 on the basis of their score. A Cox model was used to determine the association between MDC and risk for death and hospitalization. After adjustment for age, gender, baseline GFR, diabetes, and comorbidity score, there was a 50% reduction in the risk for death for the MDC compared with the non-MDC group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35 to 0.71). There was no difference in the risk for all-cause (HR 0.83; 95% CI 0.64 to 1.06) or cardiovascular-specific hospitalization (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.54 to 1.06) for the MDC compared with the non-MDC group. In conclusion, it was found that MDC was associated with a significant reduction in the risk for all-cause mortality and, although not statistically significant, a trend toward a reduction in risk for all-cause and cardiovascular-specific hospitalizations. The benefits of MDC and an assessment of their economic impact should be tested in a randomized, controlled trial.",
