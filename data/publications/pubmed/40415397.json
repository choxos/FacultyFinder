  "title": "Toward Monitoring and Addressing the Commercial Determinants of Health: Where Can We Go From Here?",
  "abstract": "Policy Points We describe ways to advance two key priorities related to the commercial determinants of health (CDH): the development of systems to monitor commercial practices and the creation of policy recommendations to address the CDH. Specifically, we discuss corporate nonfinancial reporting as a potential mechanism to obtain data on commercial practices that influence population health, describe the potential risks and benefits, and propose opportunities to advance high-quality corporate reporting on health impacts. We also review previous global agenda-setting exercises to suggest five key considerations to inform the World Health Organization's forthcoming policy recommendations for addressing the CDH.",
