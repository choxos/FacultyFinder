  "title": "Training in Team-Based Practices: A Descriptive Analysis of Family Medicine Postgraduate Site Distribution across Canada.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: College of Family Physicians of Canada accreditation policies contemplate exemplary ratings for postgraduate family medicine programs that train residents in sites aligned with the Patient's Medical Home (PMH) vision. This may overrepresent the PMH in training relative to what is available in independent practice. METHODS: We appraised training sites to describe the degree to which PMH features are present in family medicine education across the country. RESULTS: More than half (70.7%) of Canadian training sites reflect PMH features. CONCLUSION: Education policy that incentivizes PMH in training may create downstream tension for physicians who find these practices unavailable upon graduation.",
