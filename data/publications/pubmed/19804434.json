  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of the 1997 Canadian guidelines on the methods and presentation of economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective in the published literature. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify health technology economic evaluations conducted from a Canadian perspective published in peer-reviewed journals between 2001 and 2006. To investigate the impact of the 1997 Canadian Coordinating Office of Health Technology Assessment guidelines, each included study was assessed against 17 of the 25 recommendations. RESULTS: Of the 153 included studies, a base set of 9 methodological standards, as outlined by the 1997 guidelines, were followed by over 50% of the studies including: indications, outcomes for cost utility analysis, outcomes for cost benefit analysis, discounting future cost and outcomes, cost identification and valuation, evaluating uncertainty and disclosing funding relationships. Main divergences from the guidelines were found for analytic technique (38%), study perspective (23%), source of preferences (8%), equity (7%), and cost measurement (24%). CONCLUSION: The current assessment has shown that the 1997 Canadian guidelines have set a minimum methodological standard within the community of \"doers\" conducting economic analyses from a Canadian perspective. Although there was divergence from some of the recommendations, the majority were reflected as changes in the 2006 Canadian guidelines.",
