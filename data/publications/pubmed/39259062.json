  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gut microbial metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors, namely betaine, L-carnitine, and choline, have been implicated as risk factors for cardiovascular events and mortality development. Therefore, we aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the validity of these associations. METHODS: MEDLINE and Scopus were queried from their inception to August 2023 to identify studies that quantified estimates of the associations of TMAO with the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or death. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to pool unadjusted or multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals. The primary endpoint was the risk of MACE and all-cause death. RESULTS: 30 prospective observational studies (n = 48 968) were included in the analysis. Elevated TMAO levels were associated with a significantly greater risk of MACE and all-cause death compared to low TMAO levels (HR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.2-1.54, P < .00001, I2 = 43%) and (HR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.37-1.75, P < .00001, I2 = 46%), respectively. Furthermore, high levels of either L-carnitine or choline were found to significantly increase the risk of MACE. However, no significant difference was seen in MACE in either high or low levels of betaine. CONCLUSION: Elevated concentrations of TMAO were associated with increased risks of MACE and all-cause mortality. High levels of L-carnitine/choline were also significantly associated with an increased risk of MACE. However, no significant difference was found between high or low levels of betaine for the outcome of MACE.",
