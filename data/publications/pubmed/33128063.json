  "title": "Common Childhood Viruses and Pubertal Timing: The LEGACY Girls Study.",
  "abstract": "Earlier pubertal development is only partially explained by childhood body mass index; the role of other factors, such as childhood infections, is less understood. Using data from the LEGACY Girls Study (North America, 2011-2016), we prospectively examined the associations between childhood viral infections (cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1, HSV2) and pubertal timing. We measured exposures based on seropositivity in premenarcheal girls (n = 490). Breast and pubic hair development were classified based on mother-reported Tanner Stage (TS) (TS2+ compared with TS1), adjusting for age, body mass index, and sociodemographic factors. The average age at first blood draw was 9.8 years (standard deviation, 1.9 years). The prevalences were 31% CMV+, 37% EBV+, 14% HSV1+, 0.4% HSV2+, and 16% for both CMV+/EBV+ coinfection. CMV+ infection without coinfection was associated with developing breasts an average of 7 months earlier (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.12, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32, 3.40). CMV infection without coinfection and HSV1 and/or HSV2 infection were associated with developing pubic hair 9 months later (HR = 0.41, 95% CI: 0.24, 0.71, and HR = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.81, respectively). Infection was not associated with menarche. If replicated in larger cohorts with blood collection prior to any breast development, this study supports the hypothesis that childhood infections might play a role in altering pubertal timing.",
