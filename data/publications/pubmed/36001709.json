  "title": "Time to Endorse A Sensitive Method for Scoring Endoscopic Activity of Ulcerative Colitis in Clinical Research.",
  "abstract": "The endoscopic scoring of ulcerative colitis is routinely used for both individual patient management and as an endpoint in clinical trials. The most commonly used scoring system is the Mayo endoscopic subscore, which scores endoscopic disease activity on a scale between 0 and 3. With only four possible scores and consideration of only the most involved area of the colon, the Mayo endoscopic subscore lacks sensitivity to change in measuring the totality of the endoscopic inflammatory involvement in patients with ulcerative colitis. Here, we present one case study from clinical practice and one from clinical trials in which using the Mayo endoscopic score leads to potentially incorrect conclusions. Further, in a post-hoc analysis, we re-examined endoscopic videos from a clinical trial and demonstrate that assessing involved ulcerated and affected areas on a segmental level of the colon or summing Mayo scores of colonic segments can identify improvements in endoscopic disease activity in almost twice as many subjects as identified by the Mayo endoscopic subscore alone. Although the alternative scoring systems we have used in this report will need further validation, our findings demonstrate the need for a more sensitive endoscopic scoring system in ulcerative colitis.",
