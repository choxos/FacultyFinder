  "title": "Fertility preservation in pediatric central nervous system tumors: A report from the Children's Oncology Group.",
  "abstract": "The Oncofertility Consortium Pediatric Initiative Network has published recommendations about the risks of infertility due to gonadotoxic therapy. We abstracted gonadotoxic therapies from central nervous system (CNS) Children's Oncology Group (COG) protocols between 2000 and 2022. We assigned them as unknown, minimal, significant, or high levels of increased risk for gonadal dysfunction/infertility. Seven of 11 CNS protocols placed patients at a high level of risk in at least one treatment arm. Males (7/11) were most commonly at a high level of risk, followed by pubertal females (6/11) and prepubertal females (5/11), highlighting the importance of pre-treatment counseling regarding fertility preservation interventions in this population.",
