  "title": "Long-term Elevation of Complement Factors in Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients With Borna Disease Virus 1 Encephalitis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1) causes rare but severe zoonotic infections in humans, presenting as encephalitis. The case-fatality risk is very high and no effective countermeasures have been established so far. An immunopathology is presumed, while data on immune responses in humans are limited. Evidence of a role of the complement system in various neurological disorders and in viral infections of the central nervous system is increasing and specific inhibitors are available as therapeutic options. METHODS: In this study, we investigated factors of the complement system in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with BoDV-1 infections (n = 17) in comparison to noninflammatory control CSF samples (n = 11), using a bead-based multiplex assay. In addition, immunohistochemistry was performed using postmortem brain tissue samples. RESULTS: We found an intrathecal elevation of complement factors of all complement pathways and an active cascade during human BoDV-1 infections. The increase of certain complement factors such as C1q was persistent, and C3 complement deposits were detected in postmortem brain sections. Intrathecal complement levels were negatively correlated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are warranted to clarify whether targeting the complement cascade by specific inhibitors might be beneficial for patients suffering from severe BoDV-1 encephalitis.",
