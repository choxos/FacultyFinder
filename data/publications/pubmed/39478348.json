  "title": "Comparison of 2 Sets of Immunoassays Used in Modified 2-Tiered Testing Algorithms for the Diagnosis of Lyme Disease.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since 2019, modified 2-tiered testing (MTTT) algorithms have been available for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. MTTTs replaced the standard algorithms that utilized enzyme immunoassays and immunoblots with sequential enzyme immunoassays that detect different antigens. METHODS: We compared the performance of serological assays from ZEUS Scientific Inc. and DiaSorin Inc. that are used for the diagnosis of Lyme disease. Serological results were compared with clinical information gathered by chart review. RESULTS: Percent positive agreement (PPA) and percent negative agreement (PNA) for total immunoglobulin G (IgG)/immunoglogulin M (IgM) (n = 120) were 64% (95% confidence interval 54% to 73%) and 100% (87% to 100%), respectively. PPA and PNA for IgG (n = 93) were 91% (80% to 97%) and 66% (52% to 78%), respectively. PPA and PNA for IgM (n = 93) were 75% (62% to 85%) and 95% (82% to 99%), respectively. Fewer positive total IgG/IgM results confirmed positive for either IgG or IgM for ZEUS compared to DiaSorin. Overall MTTT algorithm interpretation was concordant in 58% (55/95) of samples, and concordance improved when the results were limited to IgM in patients with symptom duration <30 days. Treatment with antibiotics was most strongly associated with IgM positivity. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis highlights differences in the performance characteristics between commercially available diagnostic assays for Lyme disease. Our data suggest that the DiaSorin assays would result in fewer positive total IgG/IgM tests, decreasing the required number of confirmatory IgG and IgM tests. This would potentially lead to fewer patients treated with antibiotics.",
