  "title": "CYP3A4 and CYP3A5: the crucial roles in clinical drug metabolism and the significant implications of genetic polymorphisms.",
  "abstract": "CYP3A, a key member of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) superfamily, is integral to drug metabolism, processing a substantial portion of medications. Their role in drug metabolism is particularly prominent, as CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 metabolize approximately 30-50% of known drugs. The genetic polymorphism of CYP3A4/5 is significant inter-individual variability in enzymatic activity, which can result in different pharmacokinetic profiles in response to the same drug among individuals. These polymorphisms can lead to either increased drug toxicity or reduced therapeutic effects, requiring dosage adjustments based on genetic profiles. Consequently, the study of the enzymatic activity of CYP3A4/5 gene variants is of great importance for the formulation of personalized treatment regimens. This article first reviews the role of CYP3A4/5 in drug metabolism in the human body, including inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4/5 and drug-drug interactions. In terms of genetic polymorphism, it discusses the detection methods, enzymatic kinetic characteristics, and clinical guidelines for CYP3A5. Finally, the article summarizes the importance of CYP3A4/5 in clinical applications, including personalized therapy, management of drug-drug interactions, and adjustment of drug doses. This review contributes to the understanding of the functions and genetic characteristics of CYP3A4/5, allowing for more effective clinical outcomes through optimized drug therapy.",
