  "title": "Rebooting medical education with virtual grand rounds during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
  "abstract": "Social distancing during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has necessitated drastic changes in the practice of hospital medicine, including the cancellation of many educational activities. At the same time, the emergence of a new disease with a rapidly evolving knowledge base has mandated timely educational updates. To resolve this conflict in our hospital, we substituted 'traditional' grand rounds with 'virtual' grand rounds delivered over Zoom, consisting of a local situation report and operational update, followed by a specialty-specific clinical presentation on management of COVID-19. Attendance was greatly increased (mean 384 attendees) compared to traditional grand rounds (mean 44 attendees) and included a diverse audience of medical professionals. Feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with >80% of responders stating that the sessions would or might inform their clinical practice. COVID-19 has therefore provided an opportunity to modernise grand rounds, and develop a new model matching the needs of medical education beyond the pandemic.",
