  "title": "Fertility Considerations in Pediatric and Adolescent Patients Undergoing Cancer Therapy.",
  "abstract": "Survivors of pediatric cancer are at increased risk for infertility and premature hormonal failure. Surgeons caring for children with cancer have an important role to play in understanding this risk, as well as advocating for and performing appropriate fertility preservation procedures. Fertility preservation options in males and females vary by pubertal status and include nonexperimental (oocyte harvest, ovarian tissue cryopreservation, sperm cryopreservation) and experimental (testicular tissue cryopreservation) options. This review summarizes the basics of risk assessment and fertility preservation options and explores unique considerations in pediatric fertility preservation.",
