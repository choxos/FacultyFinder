  "title": "Reliability of nasopharyngeal PCR for the detection of otopathogens in children with uncomplicated acute otitis media compared to culture.",
  "abstract": "Otopathogens in acute otitis media (AOM) have implications for care because the likelihood of resolution without antibiotics and optimal antibiotic agent varies by microorganism. We aimed to determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of nasopharyngeal (NP) qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for common bacterial otopathogens in children with AOM compared to NP culture. NP flocked swabs collected from enrolled children aged 6 to 35 months with uncomplicated AOM in Denver, CO were tested by culture and multiplex PCR. The sensitivity and negative predictive value of PCR using culture as a reference were high (H. influenzae 93.3%, 98.0%; S. pneumoniae 94.2%, 95.1%; M. catarrhalis 92.3%, 86.4%); whereas the specificity and positive predictive value were lower and varied by organism (54.2%-84.1%, 55.1%-69.2%, respectively). PCR detected 1.5 times more organisms than culture. NP PCR has a high predictive value for excluding otopathogens compared to culture and warrants exploration as a diagnostic tool.",
