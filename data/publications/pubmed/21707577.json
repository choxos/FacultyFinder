  "title": "Haemophilia: provision of factors and novel therapies: World Federation of Hemophilia goals and achievements.",
  "abstract": "For nearly 50 years, the goal of the World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) has been to achieve 'Treatment for All' patients with inherited bleeding disorders, regardless of where they live. With proper diagnosis, management and care, people with bleeding disorders can live perfectly healthy lives. Without treatment, the reality is that many will die young or, if they survive, suffer joint damage that leaves them with permanent disabilities. Only about 25% of the estimated 400 000 people with haemophilia worldwide receive adequate treatment. The percentage is far lower for those with von Willebrand Disease (VWD) and the rarer bleeding disorders. The achievements of the WFH to close the gap in care for people with bleeding disorders are measureable over time by using three key indicators; the difference in the estimated and actual number of people known with bleeding disorders, the amount of treatment products needed versus that available, and the number of people born with bleeding disorders and the number who reach adulthood. There are five essential elements to achieve a sustainable national care programme: ensuring accurate laboratory diagnosis, achieving government support, improving the care delivery system, increasing the availability of treatment products, and building a strong national patient organization.",
