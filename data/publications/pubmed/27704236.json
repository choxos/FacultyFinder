  "title": "Neurologic Complications of Common Variable Immunodeficiency.",
  "abstract": "Common variable immunodeficiency is a rare disorder of immunity associated with a myriad of clinical manifestations including recurrent infections, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Though rare, neurologic complications have been described in a small number of case reports and case series of CVID patients. In this article, we present a patient with CVID who suffered significant neurologic morbidity and categorize the reported range of neurologic complications associated with CVID. Our case highlights the complex nature of neurologic manifestations in CVID patients, and our review of the current database suggests that infection and inflammatory neurologic disorders are the cause of most neurologic presentations.",
