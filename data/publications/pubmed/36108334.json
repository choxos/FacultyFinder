  "title": "MoveStrong at home: a feasibility study of a model for remote delivery of functional strength and balance training combined with nutrition education for older pre-frail and frail adults.",
  "abstract": "Exercise and nutrition interventions are often recommended for frailty; however, effective strategies are required for real-world implementation. Our primary aim was to assess the feasibility and acceptability of telephone and virtual delivery of MoveStrong, an 8-week exercise and nutrition program with a 4-week follow-up for older pre-frail and frail adults. A priori criteria for success included: recruitment (≥25/12 weeks), retention at follow-up (≥80%), and adherence to exercise and nutrition sessions (≥70%). We recruited community-dwelling Ontario residents; ≥60 years, ≥1 chronic condition, ≥1 FRAIL scale score. Participants received mailed materials, a personalized exercise program, 11 remote one-on-one training sessions with an exercise physiologist and 3 online dietitian-led nutrition education sessions. We completed exploratory analyses of secondary outcomes including physical function and dietary protein intake. Semi-structured interviews supported program evaluation. In total, 30 participants were enrolled. 28 (93%) participants completed program and follow-up assessments. Adherence to exercise and nutrition sessions (CI) was 84% (77%-91%) and 82% (70%-93%) respectively. At program end and follow-up [mean change (CI)], significant improvements were measured in 30-second chair stand test [3.50 (1.12-5.86), 4.54 (1.94-7.13) chair stands] and dietary protein intake [12.9 (5.7-20.0), 9.2 (0.4-18.1) g]. Overall, participants were satisfied with program delivery. Trial registration number: NCT04663685.",
