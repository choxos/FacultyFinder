  "title": "\"Look at You Having Fun With Your Markers in Here!\": Child Life Specialists' Countering of Infantilizating Narratives in Adult Oncology.",
  "abstract": "Child life specialists are clinically trained and educated healthcare professionals who work in both healthcare environments and the community to address the needs of ill children and their families. However, child life specialists have previously reported potential for their role, responsibilities, and scope of practice to be misunderstood by their clinical colleagues. Using a narrative methodology, this paper presents the composite narrative of Diane, whose story encompasses the stories of the four child life specialists working in adult oncology environments in Ontario, Canada. Diane's narrative is a counter-story, which counters common assumptions, beliefs, and attitudes about child life specialists. Through spending significant time narrating the multitude of tasks that are encompassed within her scope of care, Diane reaffirms her identity as a valuable member of an interprofessional adult oncology team and counters infantilizing assumptions that she is merely a babysitter or child entertainer. Her story highlights how, while the introduction of child life specialists to adult healthcare environments is new, the work they do is of great benefit to families and their children. The lack of understanding from clinical colleagues of the role of child life specialists, however, hinders not only the development of relationships between colleagues, but also the care for these families.",
