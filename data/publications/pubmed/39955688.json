  "title": "Skeletal health status among patients with chronic hypoparathyroidism: results from the Canadian National Hypoparathyroidism Registry (CNHR).",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: In the CNHR study, 35% of postmenopausal women had osteoporosis by BMD or fragility fracture, and 4% had both. Three men ≥ 50 had osteoporosis by BMD or fragility fracture (33.3%; n = 3/9). This suggests that close follow-up of skeletal health is necessary in postmenopausal women, and men ≥ 50 with chronic HypoPT. PURPOSE: Chronic hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) has been associated with decreased bone turnover and abnormalities in bone mineral density (BMD), microarchitecture, and strength. Current guidelines do not recommend systematic evaluation of skeletal health in patients with chronic HypoPT. Our study assessed skeletal health in pre- and postmenopausal women with chronic HypoPT and adult men. METHODS: This prospective study enrolled adults with chronic HypoPT from the Canadian National Hypoparathyroidism Registry. Clinical characteristics, bone fractures, biochemistry, and serum bone biomarkers were assessed at baseline. Skeletal health evaluation included assessments of fragility fractures, BMD at lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), total hip (TH), 1/3 radial sites, trabecular bone score (TBS), and bone biomarkers. RESULTS: We present the baseline data of the patients enrolled in the registry. We analyzed a total of 101 patients: 18 men, 35 premenopausal, and 48 postmenopausal women. The mean (SD) age at the onset of HypoPT was 40.7 (16.8) years, and the average disease duration was 11.2 (8.6) years. The most common etiology was postsurgical (74.3% vs. 25.7% non-surgical). Most patients received calcium supplements (89%) and active vitamin D (80%) at baseline. No fragility fractures or low BMD were reported in premenopausal women. However, BMD at LS, FN, TH, and TBS were significantly lower in postmenopausal compared to premenopausal women. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, 35% of postmenopausal women had osteoporosis by BMD or prior fragility fracture, and 4% had both. Three men ≥ 50 years had osteoporosis by BMD or fragility fracture (33.3%; n = 3/9). This study suggests that close follow-up of skeletal health is necessary in postmenopausal women with chronic HypoPT and men ≥ 50 years.",
