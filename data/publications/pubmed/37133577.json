  "title": "HEmoRhoidal disease management with Band ligation versus polidocanol Sclerotherapy: a systematic review and meta-analysis (the HerBS Review).",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Symptomatic internal hemorrhoids affect up to 40% of people in Western society. Patients with grade I-III hemorrhoids, who fail lifestyle and medical management, may benefit from office-based procedures. As per the American Society of Colon and Rectum Surgeons (ASCRS), rubber band ligation (RBL) is the first-line office-based treatment. Polidocanol sclerotherapy is a relatively new approach for these patients. The aim of this systematic review is to compare the efficacy of RBL and polidocanol sclerotherapy with the treatment of symptomatic grade I-III internal hemorrhoids. METHODS: The systematic review was completed by searching MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases from inception to August 2022 for prospective studies comparing RBL and polidocanol sclerotherapy or evaluating the efficacy of polidocanol sclerotherapy alone for adult (> 18 years) patients with grade I-III internal hemorrhoids. Treatments were evaluated for therapeutic success and post-procedure morbidity. RESULTS: Of 155 citations obtained, 10 studies (3 comparative and 7 single-arm studies) and 4 abstracts (2 comparative and 2 single arm) were included in the study. The patients undergoing sclerotherapy had a 93% (151/163) therapeutic success rate compared to 75% (68/91) in the RBL group (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.48-7.74, p < 0.01). The post-procedure morbidity was 8% (17/200) in the sclerotherapy group and 18% (23/128) in the RBL group (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.15-1.82, p = 0.31). CONCLUSION: This study highlights that polidocanol sclerotherapy may be associated with higher therapeutic success in patients with symptomatic grade I-III internal hemorrhoids. Further evaluations in the form of randomized trials are required to evaluate patient populations, which may benefit more from sclerotherapy.",
