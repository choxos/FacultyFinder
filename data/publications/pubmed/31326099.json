  "title": "Perioperative Troponin Screening Identifies Patients at Higher Risk for Major Cardiovascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery.",
  "abstract": "Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) includes patients with traditional myocardial infarction and those with ischemic myocardial injury after surgery. This study evaluated the prognostic value of MINS on major cardiovascular events and 30-day mortality, and determined independent preoperative predictors of MINS in patients after noncardiac surgery. This multicenter prospective cohort study was part of the VISION Study. The sample consisted of 2504 patients who underwent noncardiac surgery at 2 tertiary hospitals in Brazil between September 2008 and July 2012. Troponin Ts were measured 6-12 hours, and on days 1-3 after surgery. Cox regression analyses were performed to identify independent variables of major outcomes. A total of 314 (13%) patients were diagnosed with MINS, of which 26 (8%) died. Length-of-hospital stay of MINS patients was 3 times higher (18 ± 22 days vs 5.8 ± 11 days). In multivariate analysis, 30-day mortality was significantly higher among patients with MINS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.56-6.41)), and major bleeding (HR 5.76 (95% CI 2.75-12.05)), sepsis (HR 5.08 (95% CI 2.25-11.46)), active cancer (HR 4.22 (95% CI 1.98-8.98)), and general surgery (HR 3.11 (95% CI 1.51-6.41)). Multivariable analysis indicated a higher chance of MINS in patients ≥75 years of age, history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, coronary disease, and end-stage renal failure. The incidence of MINS within 30 days after noncardiac surgery is related to higher mortality. Postoperative troponin monitoring in elder patients and with risk factors for atherosclerotic disease may help reduce postoperative cardiovascular events.",
