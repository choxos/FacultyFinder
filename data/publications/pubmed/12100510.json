  "title": "Ureterocystoplasty (bladder augmentation) with a solitary kidney.",
  "abstract": "Children who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as a result of obstructive uropathies require evaluation and treatment of associated bladder dysfunction to ensure a good outcome following renal transplantation. Bladder dynamics can often be optimized medically, although surgical intervention is occasionally necessary. For those patients who require bladder augmentation, the use of a dilated native ureter (ureterocystoplasty) is preferred to the more commonly used intestine or stomach (enterocystoplasty), which carry a higher risk of complications. Unfortunately, most patients do not have a suitable anatomy for ureterocystoplasty and, by necessity, intestine or stomach has to be utilized. Herein, we describe the successful application of ureterocystoplasty in the presence of ESRD and a solitary kidney prior to renal transplantation. We believe that owing to the many advantages of native urothelium, every effort should be made to use ureter and avoid the use of intestine.",
