  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) reduces major cardiovascular events in patients with ST and non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Recent mechanistic and clinical data suggest that higher loading and maintenance doses of clopidogrel may achieve a more rapid and greater degree of platelet inhibition that translates into improved clinical outcomes, but this is yet to be formally evaluated in an adequately powered randomized trial. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of (1) a higher loading and initial maintenance dose of clopidogrel compared with the standard-dose regimen and (2) high-dose ASA compared with low-dose ASA in patients with ST or non-ST-segment-elevation ACS managed with an early invasive strategy. DESIGN: Multicenter, international, randomized, 2 x 2 factorial design trial evaluating a clopidogrel high-dose regimen (600 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 150 mg once daily on days 2 to 7, followed by 75 mg once daily on days 8-30) compared with the standard-dose regimen (300 mg loading dose on day 1, followed by 75 mg once daily on days 2-30) and high-dose ASA (300-325 mg daily) versus low-dose ASA (75-100 mg daily) in patients with ST or non-ST-segment-elevation ACS managed with an early invasive strategy. The clopidogrel dose comparison is double-blind and the ASA dose comparison is open-label. The primary outcome is the composite of death from cardiovascular causes, myocardial (re)infarction or stroke up to day 30. The primary safety outcome is major bleeding. The sample size is 18,000 to 20,000 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The CURRENT-OASIS 7 trial will help to define optimal dosing regimens for clopidogrel and ASA in patients with ST and non-ST-segment-elevation ACS treated with an early invasive strategy.",
