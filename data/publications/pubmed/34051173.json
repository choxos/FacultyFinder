  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare dynamic ranges and steps to measurement floors of peripapillary and macular metrics from a complex signal-based optical microangiography (OMAG[C]) optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) device for glaucoma with those of OCT measurements. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. METHODS: Imaging of 252 eyes from 173 patients with glaucoma and 123 eyes from 92 subjects without glaucoma from a glaucoma clinic was quantified using custom and commercial software. Metrics from OCT (retinal nerve fiber layer [RNFL], ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer [GCIPL]) and OCTA (custom: peripapillary vessel area density [pVAD], macular vessel area density [mVAD], and macular vessel skeleton density [mVSD]; commercial: peripapillary perfusion density [pPD[Z]], macular perfusion density [mPD[Z]], and macular vessel density [mVD[Z]]) were plotted against visual field mean deviation (MD) with linear change-point analyses, measurement floors, and steps to floors. RESULTS: Mean MD (dB) for glaucomatous eyes was -5.77 (-6.45 to -5.10). The number of eyes with mild glaucoma (MD >-6), moderate glaucoma (MD -6 to -12), and severe glaucoma (MD <-12) were 164, 50, and 38, respectively. pPD[Z] yielded the lowest estimated floor at -26.6 dB (standard error [SE] 1.53), followed by OCTA macular metrics (-25 to -21 dB; SE 1.03) and pVAD (-17.6 dB, SE 1.06). RNFL and GCIPL produced floors at -17.8 (SE 0.927) and -23.6 dB (SE 1.14). The highest number of steps to measurement floor belonged to RNFL (7.20) and GCIPL (7.33), followed by pPD[Z] (4.25), mVAD (3.87), and mVSD (3.81), with 2.5 or fewer steps for pVAD, mPD[Z], and mVD[Z]. CONCLUSIONS: pPD[Z], mVAD, and mVSD had approximately 4 steps within their dynamic ranges, without true measurement floors, and thus may be useful in evaluating advanced glaucomatous progression. Improving OCTA test-retest repeatability could augment number of steps for OCTA metrics, increasing their clinical utility.",
