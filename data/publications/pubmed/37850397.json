  "title": "Rivaroxaban Plus Aspirin Versus Aspirin Alone After Endovascular Revascularization for Symptomatic PAD: Insights From VOYAGER PAD.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone reduced major cardiac and ischemic limb events after lower extremity revascularization (LER) in the VOYAGER PAD (Vascular Outcomes Study of ASA Along With Rivaroxaban in Endovascular or Surgical Limb Revascularization for Peripheral Artery Disease) trial. The effect has not been described in patients undergoing endovascular LER. METHODS: The VOYAGER PAD trial randomized 6564 patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease to a double-blinded treatment with 2.5 mg of rivaroxaban BID or matching placebo and 100 mg of aspirin daily. The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of acute limb ischemia, major amputation of a vascular pathogenesis, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or cardiovascular death. The principal safety end point was Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding. A prespecified subgroup of patients who underwent endovascular revascularization was included. RESULTS: Endovascular LER occurred in 4379 (66.7%) patients and surgical LER in 2185 (33.3%). Over a 3-year follow-up, rivaroxaban reduced the risk of the primary outcome by 15% (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85 [95% CI, 0.76-0.96]) with an absolute risk reduction of 0.92% at 6 months and 1.04% at 3 years and a consistent benefit in those receiving endovascular (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.76-1.03]) or surgical LER (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.67-0.98]; P interaction=0.43). For endovascular-treated patients, rivaroxaban reduced the risk of acute limb ischemia or major amputation of a vascular pathogenesis by 30% (HR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.54-0.90]; P=0.005) with an absolute risk reduction of 1.0% at 6 months and 2.0% at 3 years compared with aspirin alone. Among endovascular-treated patients, the median duration of concomitant dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel treatment was 31 days (interquartile range, 30-58). There was a consistent benefit for rivaroxaban regardless of background clopidogrel. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding was significantly higher for the rivaroxaban and aspirin group for the endovascular cohort (HR, 1.66 [95% CI, 1.06-2.59]) with an absolute risk increase of 0.9% at 3 years with no increase in intracranial or fatal bleeding observed (HR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.40-1.87]; P=0.71). Mortality with rivaroxaban was higher in the endovascular-treated patients (HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.02-1.52]), although this finding was isolated to specific regions. CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban added to aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy after LER for peripheral artery disease reduces ischemic risk and increases major bleeding without an increased risk of intracranial or fatal bleeding. These benefits are consistent in those treated with endovascular and surgical approaches with significant benefits for major adverse limb events. These data support the use of rivaroxaban in addition to aspirin or dual antiplatelet therapy after endovascular intervention for symptomatic peripheral artery disease.",
