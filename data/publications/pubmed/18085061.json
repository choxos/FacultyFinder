  "abstract": "Pathologists and laboratory staff are likely to be among the first health care workers to be aware that a potential bioterrorism attack has occurred. To prepare for such an event, it is necessary to be familiar with 1) the characteristics of bioterrorism attacks versus natural disease outbreaks, 2) which pathogens are potential bioterrorism agents; 3) the types of lesions that each causes; 4) the microbiological characteristics of each agent; 5) the Laboratory Response Network and reporting requirements, and 6) what resources are available.",
