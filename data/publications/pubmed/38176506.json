  "title": "Functional modification of silk fibroin from silkworms and its application to medical biomaterials: A review.",
  "abstract": "Silk fibroin (SF) from the silkworm Bombyx mori is a fibrous protein identified as a widely suitable biomaterial due to its biocompatibility, tunable degradation, and mechanical strength. Various modifications of SF protein can give SF fibers new properties and functions, broadening their applications in textile and biomedical industries. A diverse array of functional modifications on various forms of SF has been reported. In order to provide researchers with a more systematic understanding of the types of functional modifications of SF protein, as well as the corresponding applications, we comprehensively review the different types of functional modifications, including transgenic modification, modifications with chemical groups or biologically active substance, cross-linking and copolymerization without chemical reactions, their specific modification methods and applications. Furthermore, recent applications of SF in various medical biomaterials are briefly discussed.",
