  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Thromboprophylaxis in arthroscopy is controversial. Recent literature has shown variable rates of deep vein thrombosis following routine arthroscopic knee surgery; however, it is unknown if current practice reflects the literature. We have conducted a cross sectional survey to provide insight into the practice patterns perceived risks, benefits and barrier in the use of thromboprophylaxis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 19 item survey was created regarding surgeons' use of thromboprophylaxis in their patients undergoing routine knee arthroscopy. E-mail surveys were sent out to members of the Canadian Orthopaedic Association. RESULTS: Seventy-seven responses were obtained; of which 58.2% (n=45) of surgeons stated that they had a clinical interest in sports medicine, and 37.3% (n=29) had completed a fellowship in sports medicine or arthroscopy. Fifty five surgeons (71.6%) performed more than 40 arthroscopies per year. Prolonged surgical time was the only risk factor that would significantly increase their use of prophylaxis. Practice patterns surrounding the use of thromboprophylaxis were otherwise quite variable. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey reveals that opinions and practice patterns surrounding the use of thromboprophylaxis following routine knee arthroscopy are diverse. This survey points out the need for larger well designed studies for concise guidelines.",
