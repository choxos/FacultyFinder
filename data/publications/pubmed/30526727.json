  "title": "3D-printed Wash Station with Integrated Anesthesia Delivery Manifold for High-throughput Depilation of Laboratory Mice.",
  "abstract": "Depilation (that is, hair removal) is a necessary prerequisite for many small animal surgeries and optical imaging experiments. Over-the-counter depilatory creams are widely used, owing to their efficacy, safety, and low rates of skin irritation and infection. However, the use of these creams is generally messy and time-consuming and generates considerable waste. Furthermore, the process itself varies markedly among laboratories. Here we present a 3D-printed device that simplifies the depilation procedure by integrating 3 key elements: 1) a multiple-port, self-scavenging anesthesia manifold, 2) curved animal holders with flow-through slats, and 3) a removable waste collection tray. Reflecting insights gained from an international survey about depilatory lab procedures that highlighted the lack of standardized protocols, this apparatus is designed to improve the neatness, throughput, and safety of mouse depilation, resulting in efficient and repeatable processes that bolster the welfare of both researchers and subjects.",
