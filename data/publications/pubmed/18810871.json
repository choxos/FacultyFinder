  "title": "Detection of abrin in food using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescence technologies.",
  "abstract": "Abrin is a toxic ribosome-inactivating protein present in beans of Abrus precatorius, also known as rosary peas. The possibility that abrin could be used to adulterate food has made the development of assays for the detection of abrin a priority. Rabbit-derived polyclonal antibodies and mouse monoclonal antibodies were prepared against a mixture of abrin isozymes. The specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibodies were evaluated against a challenge library of 40 grains, nuts, legumes, and foods. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an electrochemiluminescence (ECL)-based assay were assembled and optimized. Polyclonal (capture) and polyclonal (detection) ELISAs, polyclonal and monoclonal ELISAs, and polyclonal and monoclonal ECL assays had limits of detection (LODs) of 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml for abrin in buffer. The LOD for abrin dissolved into juices, dairy products, soda, chocolate drink, and condiments and analyzed with the ECL assay ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 ng/ml in the analytical sample. In contrast, the LODs for the ELISAs ranged from 0.5 to 10 ng/ml in the analytical sample.",
