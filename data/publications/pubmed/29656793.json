  "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs play crucial roles in the initiation and progression of various malignant tumors. VIM-AS1 RNA is an lncRNA that transcribes from a shared bidirectional promoter with vimentin mRNA and its function in cancer cells is largely unknown. This study assessed the clinical significance of VIM-AS1 expression in colorectal cancer (CRC). We found that the VIM-AS1 transcript was significantly upregulated in high-grade, lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion tumors. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that the downregulation of VIM-AS1 could inhibit tumor cell proliferation by inducing apoptosis, cellular senescence and arresting the cell cycle. Moreover, the obtained data demonstrated that VIM-AS1 might play a crucial role in cell migration as well as the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells. Collectively, for the first time, our data provide novel evidence for the biological and clinical significance of VIM-AS1 expression in CRC. Further, the findings of this study suggest that VIM-AS1 promotes tumor growth and metastasis by inducing EMT in CRC cells and could be considered as a novel tumor marker with probable value in diagnosis and CRC treatment.",
