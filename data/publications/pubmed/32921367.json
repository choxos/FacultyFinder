  "title": "Complete or Incomplete Revascularization for ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction: The PRAMI Trial to COMPLETE.",
  "abstract": "Many patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Following successful primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of culprit lesion, whether to routinely revascularize nonculprit lesions or treat them medically has been debated. Recently, the large-scale, multinational COMPLETE trial definitively established benefit of routine, staged, angiographically guided nonculprit lesion PCI in reducing hard clinical outcomes, including the composite of death from cardiovascular causes or new myocardial infarction, with no major safety concerns. A strategy of complete revascularization with routine nonculprit lesion PCI in suitable lesions should be standard of care in STEMI with multivessel CAD.",
