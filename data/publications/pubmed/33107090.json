  "title": "Atmospheric deposition of arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc near an operating and an abandoned lead smelter.",
  "abstract": "Atmospheric deposition samples were collected over 15 mo at several locations near an operating smelter and an abandoned Pb smelter to investigate the contribution of Pb smelting to depositional fluxes and potential local air quality degradation. Samples were analyzed for As, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Concentrations of Cd and Pb at both sites were greater than at the control site (p < .05), and significant correlations existed between Cd and Pb concentrations at both sites (p < .05). Monthly depositional flux variations at both sites were similar, with greater deposition during cold and dry periods. Heavy metal(loid)s deposition during these periods was correlated with wind speed. Greater Cd depositional flux differences were found between the smelter and control sites compared with other elements. The SEM images suggested that some particles at the operating smelter site were from Pb smelting material. However, most particles at both sites had no characteristics of smelting, suggesting reactions occurred between the smelter-emitted particles and soil components. The EDS results indicated that atmospheric deposition from both sites had lower Pb concentrations than smelting material or ash. The main atmospheric deposition source at the operating and abandoned sites was likely from the resuspension of heavy metal(loid)-enriched soil particles. Greater risk of air pollution from historical Pb smelting facilities exists years after closing down. Reducing soil wind erosional losses may help reduce heavy metal(loid)s dispersion across environments.",
