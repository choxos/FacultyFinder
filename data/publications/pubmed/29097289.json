  "title": "Assessment of self-management in patients with diabetes using the novel LMC Skills, Confidence and Preparedness Index (SCPI).",
  "abstract": "AIMS: The LMC Skills, Confidence & Preparedness Index (SCPI) is an electronic tool designed to meet ISOQOL standards and (a) assess three dimensions: knowledge, confidence and preparedness; (b) provide a clinically meaningful measure; (c) provide immediate feedback to the healthcare provider. Internal consistency and external validity have been previously reported in a refractory diabetes cohort. This larger evaluation, broader in glycemic control, sought to assess clinical relevance to glycemia. METHODS: Participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were recruited from LMC Diabetes and Endocrinology specialist clinics, from April to October 2016. Participants completed the SCPI using a tablet. Demographic and laboratory data were extracted from the LMC Diabetes Patient Registry. RESULTS: In total, 529 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in psychometric analyses; 518 patients with established diabetes (>6 months) were assessed for SCPI - glycemia correlations. SCPI scores were found to have a high degree of validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability. Most importantly, the tool showed good external validity in its relation to glycemic control, both in tertile analysis, demonstrating a threshold effect consistent with a 'moderate' degree of poor control; and in overall correlation with HbA1c for the total SCPI score and two subscales (Skills and Confidence). CONCLUSIONS: The SCPI tool is a quick (25 items), easy to use measure of three domains - knowledge, confidence and preparedness. The instant scoring and specific feedback, as well as the relationship to glycemic control should provide significant value in the patient assessment in the diabetes clinic.",
