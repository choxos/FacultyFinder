  "title": "A Multiphase Mixed Methods Study on the Integration of a Population Health Approach in Sexual Health Programs and Services in Ontario Public Health Units.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study investigated the extent of and factors influencing implementation of a population health approach within sexual health programming in public health. METHOD: This sequential multi-phase mixed methods study combined findings from a quantitative survey assessing the extent that a population health approach was implemented in sexual health programs in Ontario public health units and qualitative interviews with sexual health managers and/or supervisors. Interviews explored factors influencing implementation and were analyzed using directed content analysis. RESULTS: Staff from fifteen of 34 public health units completed surveys and ten interviews were completed with sexual health managers/supervisors. From the 8 Population Health Key Elements Template, 6 elements were moderately implemented and 2 had low implementation. Qualitative findings focused on enablers and barriers to implementing a population health approach in sexual health programs and services and explained most of the quantitative results. However, some of the quantitative findings were not explained by qualitative data (e.g., low implementation of using the principles of social justice). CONCLUSION: Qualitative findings revealed factors influencing the implementation of a population health approach. A lack of resources available to health units, differing priorities between health units and community stakeholders, and access to evidence around population-level interventions influenced implementation.",
