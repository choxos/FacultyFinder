  "title": "Involvement of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the neuroprotective mechanisms of ferulic acid against depressive-like behaviour.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ferulic acid (FA) is a common food ingredient that is abundantly present in various routinely consumed food and beverages. Like many cinnamic acid derivatives, FA produces wide-ranging effects in a dose-dependent manner and various studies link FA consumption with reduced risk of depressive disorders. The aim of this study was to exploit the neuroprotective mechanisms of FA including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and other pro-inflammatory cytokines by employing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive-like behaviour model. METHODS: C57BL/6J male mice were divided into 4 groups consisting of saline (SAL), LPS, FA and Imipramine (IMI). Animals were pretreated orally with FA (10 mg/kg) and IMI (10 mg/kg) for 21 days once daily and all groups except SAL were challenged with LPS (0.83 mg/kg) intraperitoneally on day 21. RESULTS: LPS administration produced a biphasic change in the behaviour of the animals where the animals lost a significant weight and express high immobility time at 24 h. Proinflammatory cytokines including, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, and IFN-γ were significantly increased along with increased lipid peroxidation and reduced BDNF. Furthermore, the increased kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was indicative of elevated IDO activity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study emphasise that low dose of FA is effective in attenuating depressive-like behaviour by modulating IDO, BDNF and reducing neuroinflammation.",
