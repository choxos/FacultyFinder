  "title": "Prognostic and Immunotherapeutic Predictive Value of CAD Gene in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Integrated Bioinformatics and Experimental Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common type of cancer that ranks first in cancer-associated death worldwide. Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase (CAD) are the key components of the pyrimidine pathway, which promotes cancer development. However, the function of CAD in HCC needs to be clarified. In this study, the clinical and transcriptome data of 424 TCGA-derived HCC cases were analyzed. The results demonstrated that high CAD expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. The effect of CAD on HCC was then investigated comprehensively using GO annotation analysis, KEGG enrichment analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and CIBERSORT algorithm. The results showed that CAD expression was correlated with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immune cell infiltration. In addition, low CAD levels in HCC patients predicted increased sensitivity to anti-CTLA4 and PD1, while HCC patients with high CAD expression exhibited high sensitivity to chemotherapeutic and molecular-targeted agents, including gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and sorafenib. Finally, the results from clinical sample suggested that CAD expression increased remarkably in HCC compared with non-cancerous tissues. Loss of function experiments demonstrated that CAD knockdown could significantly inhibit HCC cell growth and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, the results indicated that CAD is a potential oncogene during HCC metastasis and progression. Therefore, CAD is recommended as a candidate marker and target for HCC prediction and treatment.",
