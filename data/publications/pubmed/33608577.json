  "title": "Investigating an increase in Florida manatee mortalities using a proteomic approach.",
  "abstract": "Two large-scale Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris) mortality episodes were reported on separate coasts of Florida in 2013. The east coast mortality episode was associated with an unknown etiology in the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). The west coast mortality episode was attributed to a persistent Karenia brevis algal bloom or 'red tide' centered in Southwest Florida. Manatees from the IRL also had signs of cold stress. To investigate these two mortality episodes, two proteomic experiments were performed, using two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) LC-MS/MS. Manatees from the IRL displayed increased levels of several proteins in their serum samples compared to controls, including kininogen-1 isoform 1, alpha-1-microglobulin/bikunen precursor, histidine-rich glycoprotein, properdin, and complement C4-A isoform 1. In the red tide group, the following proteins were increased: ceruloplasmin, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 isoform 3, angiotensinogen, complement C4-A isoform 1, and complement C3. These proteins are associated with acute-phase response, amyloid formation and accumulation, copper and iron homeostasis, the complement cascade pathway, and other important cellular functions. The increased level of complement C4 protein observed in the red tide group was confirmed through the use of Western Blot.",
