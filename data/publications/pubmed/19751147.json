  "abstract": "We proposed that pharmacological manipulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with diazoxide enhanced their survival and regenerative potential via NFkappaB regulation. MSCs preconditioned ((PC)MSCs) with diazoxide and later subjected to oxidant stress with 100 micromol/L H(2)O(2) either immediately or after 24 h exhibited higher survival (p < 0.01 vs nonpreconditioned MSCs; (Non-PC)MSCs) with concomitantly increased phosphorylation of PI3K, Akt, GSK3beta (cytoplasmic), and NF-kappaB (p65) (nuclear). Akt kinase activity was determined as a function of GSK3beta activity. Pretreatment of (PC)MSCs with Wortmannin (Wt), NEMO-binding domain (NBD), or NF-kappaB (p50) siRNA abolished NF-kappaB (p65) activity. Preconditioning increased NF-kappaB-dependent elevation of secretable growth factors associated with their paracrine effects. Inhibition of PI3K activity with Wt reduced (PC)MSCs viability at both early and 24 h time-points. However, inhibition of NF-kappaB reduced viability of (PC)MSCs only at 24 h time-point. For in vivo studies, DMEM without cells (group-1) or containing 1 x 10(6) male (Non-PC)MSCs (group-2), (PC)MSCs (group-3), (PC)MSCs pretreated with Wortmannin (group-4) or NF-kappaB decoy (group-5) were transplanted in a female rat model of acute myocardial infarction. Group-3 showed highest cell survival and growth factor expression, increased angiomyogenesis, and functional improvement. We conclude that activation of NF-kappaB by preconditioning promoted (PC)MSCs survival and angiomyogenic potential in the infarcted heart.",
