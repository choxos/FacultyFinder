  "title": "The prevalence, correlates, and costs of depression in people living with HIV/AIDS in Ontario: implications for service directions.",
  "abstract": "As new technologies extend the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS (PHA), the need increases for services that optimize their quality-of-life cost effectively. This study of PHAs (n = 297) in Ontario, Canada, examined the prevalence of depression, and its association with quality-of-life, coping strategies, social support, and use of health and social services. Results showed that depression was widespread (54.2%) and largely unrelated to demographic characteristics, but associated with diminished health status, health-related quality-of-life, and coping strategies. Depressed PHAs used significantly more crisis health care and related services, and community-based HIV/AIDS service organizations (ASOs). Findings suggest quality-of-life of PHAs may be improved by expanding the capacity of ASO workers to recognize and address depression, including helping depressed PHA access appropriate medication and sustain medication regimes.",
