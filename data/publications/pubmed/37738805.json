  "title": "Physical activity interventions for cancer-related fatigue: A scoping review of randomized controlled trials from a Nursing Science Precision Health Model perspective.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Nursing Science Precision Health (NSPH) Model has the potential to guide research on the development, testing, and targeting of interventions. PURPOSE: This scoping review examines the relationship between physical activity (PA) and cancer-related fatigue (CRF) within the context of the NSPH Model. METHODS: The Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guided this review. We included randomized controlled trials in people with cancer that investigated PA interventions and measured change in CRF as an outcome. DISCUSSION: A total of 181 studies met the eligibility criteria. Over 20 different instruments were used to measure CRF. The most common PA interventions were strength training (48%), walking (36%), cycling (26%), and yoga (15%). A limited number of studies reported phenotypic characteristics (32/181,Â 17%) or biomarkers (31/181, 17%) associated with CRF. CONCLUSION: This scoping review identified the body of existing research exploring CRF and PA from a precision health perspective.",
