  "title": "Serum fat-soluble vitamins and the menstrual cycle in women of childbearing age.",
  "abstract": "Evidence suggests that fat-soluble vitamins are involved in reproduction, but their association with the menstrual cycle, the proxy of female fecundity, remains largely unexplored in women of childbearing age. Serum fat-soluble vitamin levels were measured by HPLC-MS/MS and menstrual cycle data were acquired from 3123 women of reproductive age in Nanjing, China, using standard questionnaires. Irregular and long menstrual cycles occurred in 725 (23.2%) and 604 (19.3%) participants, respectively. Participants with higher levels of vitamins A and K had increased odds of irregular menstrual cycles (vitamin A: OR = 1.39 (95% CI: 1.12, 1.74); vitamin K: OR = 1.41 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.76)) and long menstrual cycles (vitamin A: OR = 1.34 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.69); vitamin K: OR = 1.27 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.61)), and the relationship showed a linear dose-response pattern (P-overall < 0.05, P-nonlinearity > 0.05). Vitamin A was positively associated with the average menstrual cycle length (Î²: 1.83, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.39). Vitamins A and K were interacted in their associations with irregular menstrual cycles and long cycles. In sensitivity analysis with further exclusion of participants with abnormal thyroid function or a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the association of vitamins A and K with the menstrual cycle remained robust. This study indicates that higher serum vitamin A and K levels in women of childbearing age are significantly associated with higher odds of irregular and long menstrual cycles with a linear dose-response curve. Further investigations are warranted to determine the appropriate fat-soluble vitamin levels for women of childbearing age.",
