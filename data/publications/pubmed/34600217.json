  "title": "Association of renal transplantation with reduced risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke in ANCA-associated vasculitis: An observational cohort study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke are leading causes of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality in ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), especially for the 20% with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). We assessed the impact of renal transplantation on the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke among patients with ESRD due to AAV. METHODS: We identified patients from the United States Renal Data System with ESRD due to AAV between 2000 and 2016. We examined the association between renal transplantation and the risk of non-fatal and fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke among waitlisted patients using Medicare claims and death data through 2017. We used time-varying Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke events among patients who received a renal transplant compared to those who remained on the waitlist. RESULTS: Of 1029 waitlisted patients, 593 (58%) were transplanted over a mean of 5.7 years. There were 17 events (4.6/1,000 person-years) in the transplanted group and 40 events (13.7/1,000 person-years) in the group that remained waitlisted. A renal transplant was associated with a 78% lower risk of myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke (HR=0.22, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47). These findings persisted across sex and age groups and when censoring patients after living donor transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Among AAV patients with ESRD, renal transplantation can substantially reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Improving access to transplantation for this population may further improve outcomes.",
