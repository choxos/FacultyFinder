  "title": "Similar long-term outcomes for laparoscopic versus open live-donor nephrectomy kidney grafts: an OPTN database analysis of 5532 adult recipients.",
  "abstract": "Prior studies that included both adult and pediatric recipients suggested slower early graft function for laparoscopically (vs. openly) procured live donor kidney grafts (LD-Ktxs). Any potential long-term impact, however, remains unknown. We compared long-term outcomes of 2685 (49%) laparoscopic vs. 2847 (51%) open LD-Ktxs reported to the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network performed in adult (> or =18 yrs) recipients between November 1999 and December 2000, with follow-up to February 2006. Acute and chronic rejection accounted for 152 laparoscopic (51%) vs. 148 (46%) open graft losses (P=NS). At discharge and at 5 years, graft function was similar for both groups; graft survival at 5 years was 79% (laparoscopic) vs. 80% (open) (P=NS). We conclude that despite prior reports of slower early laparoscopic LD-Ktx function, both laparoscopic and open nephrectomy are equally effective for procurement of kidneys for adult recipients with regard to short- and long-term (>5 years) function and survival. Future studies must investigate whether these findings apply also to pediatric LD-Ktx recipients.",
