  "title": "Controlled release of lawsone from polycaprolactone/gelatin electrospun nano fibers for skin tissue regeneration.",
  "abstract": "In this study, we aimed to evaluate the role of electrospun nanofibers containing lawsone (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone) in wound healing. Different concentrations of lawsone (0.5%, 1%, 1.5%) were electrospun in polycaprolactone-gelatin (PCL/Gel) polymers in core-shell architecture. Nanofibers were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Coaxial electrospinning of PCL/Gel/lawsone (PCL/Gel/Law) scaffolds prolonged the release of lawsone over a period of 20 days. In vitro bioactivity of fibers on human gingiva fibroblast cells (HGF) was evaluated by MTT assay. The PCL/Gel/Law 1% increased cell attachment and proliferation significantly. Additionally, the in vitro gene expression of transforming growth factor Î² (TGF-B1), collagen (COL1) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was monitored using RT-qPCR technique, which there was significant increase in TGF-B1 and COL1 gene expression in PCL/Gel/Law 0.5% and 1% mats. In vivo wound healing activity of lawsone loaded scaffolds in rat wound model revealed that the PCL/Gel/Law 1% had the highest impact on healing by increasing re-epithelialization of the wound after 14 days. It can be inferred that lawsone 1% incorporation in the core of PCL/Gel electrospun nanofibers has excellent characteristics and can be used as wound dressing patch in medicine.",
