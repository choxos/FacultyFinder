  "abstract": "High interferon production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC) was unexpectedly noted after their coculture with CD4(+) cells from a healthy donor whose cells subsequently showed human herpesvirus type 6 and 7 infections. This release of interferon was not observed with uninfected normal CD4(+) cells. Induction of PDC interferon production could help screen for covert virus infections.",
