  "title": "Giant cell reparative granuloma of the middle phalanx of the foot: a review and case report.",
  "abstract": "Giant cell reparative granuloma is a benign, rare non-neoplastic intraosseous lesion. It is found in various sites throughout the body, including the foot. This uncommon lesion has histological and radiographic features that are similar to other giant cell lytic lesions. Therefore, it is essential to be aware of this lesion to avoid confusion with more aggressive tumors. The purpose of this case report is to present the histological and radiographic findings of a 26-year-old female who had successful surgical excision and resolution of a giant cell reparative granuloma in the middle phalanx third digit left foot.",
