  "title": "Enhanced recovery support for people with eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic: quality improvement using a web-based, stepped-care programme in Canada.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of individuals struggling with eating disorders (EDs) increased substantially. Body Brave (a not-for-profit) created and implemented a web-based stepped-care Recovery Support Programme (RSP) to improve access to community-based ED services. This quality improvement study describes the RSP and assesses its ability to deliver timely access to treatment and platform engagement. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing access to, and use of Body Brave services 6 months before and 12 months after implementation of the RSP platform (using 6-month increments for two postimplementation periods). Primary programme quality measures included registration requests, number of participants onboarded and time to access services; secondary measures included use of RSP action plans, attendance for recovery sessions and workshops, number of participants accessing treatment and text-based patient experience data. RESULTS: A substantial increase in registration requests was observed during the first postimplementation period compared with the preimplementation period (176.5 vs 85.5; p=0.028). When compared with the preimplementation period, the second postimplementation observed a significantly larger percentage of successfully onboarded participants (76.6 vs 37.9; p<0.01) and a reduction in the number of days to access services (2 days vs 31 days; p<0.01). Although participant feedback rates were low, many users found the RSP helpful, easy to access, user-friendly and were satisfied overall. Users provided suggestions for improvement (eg, a platform instructional video, offer multiple times of day for live sessions and drop-in hours). CONCLUSIONS: Although clinical benefit needs to be assessed, our findings demonstrate that the RSP enabled participants to quickly onboard and access initial services and have informed subsequent improvements. Understanding initial programme effects and usage will help assess the feasibility of adapting and expanding the RSP across Canada to address the urgent need for low-barrier, patient-centred ED care.",
