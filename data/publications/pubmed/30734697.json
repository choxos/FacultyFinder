  "title": "Genetic Markers of Benzimidazole Resistance among Human Hookworms (Necator americanus) in Kintampo North Municipality, Ghana.",
  "abstract": "Hookworm infection causes anemia, malnutrition, and growth delay, especially in children living in sub-Saharan Africa. The World Health Organization recommends periodic mass drug administration (MDA) of anthelminthics to school-age children (SAC) as a means of reducing morbidity. Recently, questions have been raised about the effectiveness of MDA as a global control strategy for hookworms and other soil-transmitted helminths (STHs). Genomic DNA was extracted from Necator americanus hookworm eggs isolated from SAC enrolled in a cross-sectional study of STH epidemiology and deworming response in Kintampo North Municipality, Ghana. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was then used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with benzimidazole resistance within the N. americanus Î²-tubulin gene. Both F167Y and F200Y resistance-associated SNPs were detected in hookworm samples from infected study subjects. Furthermore, the ratios of resistant to wild-type SNP at these two loci were increased in posttreatment samples from subjects who were not cured by albendazole, suggesting that deworming drug exposure may enrich resistance-associated mutations. A previously unreported association between F200Y and a third resistance-associated SNP, E198A, was identified by sequencing of F200Y amplicons. These data confirm that markers of benzimidazole resistance are circulating among hookworms in central Ghana, with unknown potential to impact the effectiveness and sustainability of chemotherapeutic approaches to disease transmission and control.",
