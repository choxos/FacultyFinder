  "title": "The relationship between work-related musculoskeletal disorders, chronic occupational fatigue, and work organization: A multi-hospital cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: To identify the prevalence of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, levels of chronic occupational fatigue, and how they vary with individual and work organization factors. DESIGN: A multi-hospital cross-sectional survey. METHODS: Nurses from 39 hospitals completed self-reported questionnaires from June to September 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize hospitals and nurses' characteristics, fatigue levels and prevalence, and type of musculoskeletal disorders. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to identify correlational factors. RESULTS: The results revealed that 71.3% of participants reported a work-related musculoskeletal disorder in the previous 12Â months, mainly back pain. The reported musculoskeletal disorders were significantly correlated with years of experience, nurse to patient ratios, and chronic occupational fatigue. Higher chronic occupational fatigue levels were associated with education, age, years of experience, nurse to patient ratio, and model of care. CONCLUSION: Preventive work organization strategies are needed to ensure healthier occupational environment for nurses.",
