  "title": "Evaluating the effectiveness of a brief group cognitive behavioural therapy intervention for perinatal depression.",
  "abstract": "Little is known about the effectiveness of group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in women with perinatal depression (PND) and psychiatric comorbidities. Thirty-four women with PND (sixty-two percent with comorbidity) completed a 9-week CBT group. Eighty percent showed a clinically significant improvement in depressive symptoms. Meaningful gains in social support, mother-infant bonding, and partner relationship quality were seen. Brief group CBT can be effective in the treatment of PND in women with psychiatric comorbidities and may be a less resource-intensive alternative to individual psychotherapy.",
