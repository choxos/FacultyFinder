  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Simulation-based technical skills training is now ubiquitous in medicine, particularly for high acuity, low occurrence (HALO) procedures. Mastery learning and deliberate practice (ML + DP) are potentially valuable educational methods, however, they are resource intensive. We sought to compare the effect of deliberate practice and mastery learning versus self-guided practice on skill performance of the rare, life-saving procedure, a bougie-assisted cricothyroidotomy (BAC). METHODS: We conducted a multi-center, randomized study at five North American emergency medicine (EM) residency programs. We randomly assigned 176 EM residents to either the ML + DP or self-guided practice groups. Three blinded airway experts independently evaluated BAC skill performance by video review before (pre-test), after (post-test) and 6-12 months (retention) after the training session. The primary outcome was post-test skill performance using a global rating score (GRS). Secondary outcomes included performance time and skill performance at the retention test. RESULTS: Immediately following training, GRS scores were significantly higher as mean performance improved from pre-test, (22, 95% CI = 21-23) to post-test (27, 95% CI = 26-28), (p < 0.001) for all participants. However, there was no difference between the groups on GRS scores (p = 0.2) at the post-test or at the retention test (p = 0.2). At the retention test, participants in the ML + DP group had faster performance times (66 s, 95% CI = 57-74) compared to the self-guided group (77 s, 95% CI = 67-86), (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in skill performance between groups. Residents who received deliberate practice and mastery learning demonstrated an improvement in skill performance time.",
