  "title": "Exploring ethnic representativeness in diabetes clinical trial enrolment from 2000 to 2020: a chronological survey.",
  "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Ethnic representativeness of participant enrolment in diabetes RCTs involving multiple ethnicities remains unknown. The aims of this study were to evaluate the status and temporal trend of ethnic representativeness in enrolment to diabetes RCTs, and to assess under-enrolment of non-white ethnic groups and explore trial characteristics associated with under-enrolment. METHODS: We conducted a chronological survey by systematically searching the literature to include eligible RCTs published between January 2000 and December 2020. We assessed temporal trends in enrolment of ethnic groups in the included trials. Univariable logistic regression was used to explore the association between trial characteristics and under-enrolment of non-white groups, using a participant to prevalence ratio of <0.8 to define under-enrolment. This study was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021229100). RESULTS: We included 405 RCTs for analysis (327 multi-country trials, 69 conducted in the USA and nine conducted in the UK). The median enrolment rate of all non-white groups was 24.0% in the overall RCTs. Trials conducted in the USA and the UK had median enrolment rates of 29.0% and 12.0% for all non-white groups, respectively. There was a temporal trend towards increased participation of non-white ethnic groups in the overall RCTs; however, no significant improvement over time was found in the US or UK trials. Non-white groups were under-enrolled in most included trials: 62.3% (43/69) in US trials and 77.8% (7/9) in UK trials. The US trials with a high female proportion were associated with lower odds of under-enrolment of all non-white groups (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.07, 0.65), while trials receiving funding from industry showed increased odds of under-enrolment (OR 4.64; 95% CI 1.50, 14.35). Outpatient enrolment and intervention duration were significantly associated with under-enrolment of Black participants. Only a small proportion of trials reported subgroup results or explored the effect modification by ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: A temporal trend towards increased non-white ethnic enrolment was found in diabetes RCTs globally, but not in the USA or the UK. Non-white ethnic groups were under-represented in the majority of diabetes trials conducted in the USA and the UK. Some trial characteristics may be associated with non-white under-enrolment in diabetes trials. These findings provide some evidence for non-white ethnic representativeness in diabetes trials over the past two decades, and highlight the need for more effective strategies and endeavours to alleviate under-enrolment of non-white ethnic groups.",
