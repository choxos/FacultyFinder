  "abstract": "Adolescent participation in academic/extracurricular activities is related to fewer diagnoses of sexually transmitted infections during adolescence. The role parents play in motivating participation in such activities is unclear. This mixed-methods study explored parental influences on academic/extracurricular activity participation, and the relationship of such participation to adolescents' future aspirations and sexual behavior, over a 4-year period. We utilized semistructured interviews with 28 White and Asian American adolescents (age 17-19) and event history calendar self-reports of activities, part-time jobs, and sexual behaviors. Data triangulation was used to integrate qualitative and quantitative data. Increased participation was correlated with abstinence and later sexual onset. Many adolescents reported that parents were reluctant to talk with them about sexual risks and instead preferred to keep them busy and ensure that they had the \"right\" friends. Adolescents endorsed the parental strategy of keeping them busy with activities. Findings and implications for school nursing practice are discussed.",
