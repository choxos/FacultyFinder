  "title": "Systematic Review and Quality Appraisal of Practice Guidelines for Self-Harm in Children and Adolescents.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to systematically identify and appraise clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) relating to the assessment and management of suicide risk and self-harm in children and adolescents. Our research question is as follows: For young people (under 18 years old) presenting to clinical care with suicide ideation or a history of self-harm, what is the quality of up-to-date CPGs? Using the PRISMA format, we systematically identified CPGs meeting our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subsequently, two independent raters conducted appraisals of the eligible CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument. CPGs were then classified as \"poor quality,\" \"minimum quality,\" and \"high quality\" using operationally defined criteria developed a priori. We identified 10 eligible CPGs published or renewed between 2005 and May 2017. Only the long-term management of self-harm CPGs produced by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence met \"high-quality\" criteria. Despite multiple options of CPGs published to choose from, only one was identified as \"high quality,\" where bias is adequately minimized. Clinicians are advised to direct resources to implementing the \"high-quality\" CPG.",
