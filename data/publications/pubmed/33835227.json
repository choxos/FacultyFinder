  "abstract": "Evaluation of the effects of methanolic extract of Cucumis melo in ethylene glycol-induced nephrolithiasis on Wistar rats. 0.75% solution of ethylene glycol (EG) in payable water was given to produce nephrolithiasis on Wistar rats. The action of oral intake of methanolic extract of Cucumis melo seed in nephrolithiasis is studied and is matched with the action of oral intake of Cystone (standard) on Wistar rats. EG resulted in hyperoxaluria and deposition of calcium oxalate as well as raised urinary excretion of oxalate and calcium. Supplementation with methanolic extract of Cucumis melo seed decreased the increased renal oxalate, indicating a regulatory effect on oxalate formation endogenously. The outcomes stipulate that the seed of Cucumis melo is endowed with antinephrolithiatic action.",
