  "title": "Socioeconomic disparity in mortality and the burden of cardiovascular disease: analysis of the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE)-China cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although socioeconomic inequality in cardiovascular health has long been a public health focus, the differences in cardiovascular-disease burden and mortality between people with different socioeconomic statuses has yet to be adequately addressed. We aimed to assess the effects of socioeconomic status, measured via three socioeconomic-status indicators (ie, education, occupation, and household wealth and a composite socioeconomic-status disparity index, on mortality and cardiovascular-disease burden (ie, incidence, mortality, and admission to hospital) in China. METHODS: For this analysis, we used data from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE)-China cohort study, which enrolled adults aged 35-70 years from 115 urban and rural areas in 12 provinces in China between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2009. Final follow-up was on Aug 30, 2021. Indicators of socioeconomic status were education, occupation, and household wealth; these individual indicators were also used to create an integrated socioeconomic-status index via latent class analysis. Standard questionnaires administered by trained researchers were used to obtain baseline data and were supplemeted by physical measurements. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-disease mortality, non-cardiovascular-disease mortality, major cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular-disease admission to hospital. Hazard ratios (HRs) and average marginal effects were used to assess the association between the primary outcomes and socioeconomic status. FINDINGS: Of 47 931 participants enrolled in the PURE-China study, 47 278 (98·6%) had complete information on sex and follow-up. After excluding 1189 (2·5%) participants with missing data on education, household wealth, and occupation at baseline, 46 089 participants were included in this analysis. Median follow-up was 11·9 years (IQR 9·5-12·6); 26 860 (58·3%) of 46 089 participants were female and 19 229 (41·7%) were male. Having no or primary education, unskilled occupation, or being in the lowest third of household wealth was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular-disease mortality, non-cardiovascular-disease mortality, major cardiovascular disease, and cardiovascular-disease admission to hospital compared with having higher education, a professional or managerial occupation, or more household wealth. After adjustment for confounders, people categorised as having low integrated socioeconomic status based on the index had a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1·65 [95% CI 1·42-1·92]), cardiovascular-disease mortality (2·19 [1·68-2·85]), non-cardiovascular disease mortality (1·43 [1·18-1·72]), major cardiovascular disease (1·43 [1·27-1·61]) and cardiovascular-disease admission to hospital (1·14 [1·01-1·28]) compared with people categorised as having high integrated socioeconomic status. INTERPRETATION: Socioeconomic-status inequalities in mortality and cardiovascular-disease outcomes exist in China. Targeted policies of equal health-care resource allocation should be promoted to equitably benefit people with fewer years of education and less household wealth.
