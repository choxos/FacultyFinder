  "title": "A pilot feasibility study of an extension of the acquaintanceship recruitment procedure in recent-onset psychosis.",
  "abstract": "The acquaintanceship recruitment procedure is an appealing yet infrequently used method to recruit controls, allowing a very close match between patients and controls. We used an extension of the acquaintanceship procedure to investigate the feasibility of this method to recruit controls in a neuropsychological study of recent-onset psychotic patients. Twenty-five recent-onset psychotic patients attending a multidisciplinary program devoted to recent-onset psychoses were contacted, among whom 13 agreed to participate to the study. At the end of the process, only four control participants were assessed. This pilot study suggests that several obstacles prevent the use of this procedure to recruit controls in this research focusing on recent-onset psychotic disorders.",
