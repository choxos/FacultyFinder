  "title": "The Molecular Circadian Clock of Phox2b-expressing Cells Drives Daily Variation of the Hypoxic but Not Hypercapnic Ventilatory Response in Mice.",
  "abstract": "While the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) controls 24-h rhythms in breathing, including minute ventilation (VE), the mechanisms by which the SCN drives these daily changes are not well understood. Moreover, the extent to which the circadian clock regulates hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory chemoreflexes is unknown. We hypothesized that the SCN regulates daily breathing and chemoreflex rhythms by synchronizing the molecular circadian clock of cells. We used whole-body plethysmography to assess ventilatory function in transgenic BMAL1 knockout (KO) mice to determine the role of the molecular clock in regulating daily rhythms in ventilation and chemoreflex. Unlike their wild-type littermates, BMAL1 KO mice exhibited a blunted daily rhythm in VE and failed to demonstrate daily variation in the hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR) or hypercapnic ventilatory response (HCVR). To determine if the observed phenotype was mediated by the molecular clock of key respiratory cells, we then assessed ventilatory rhythms in BMAL1[fl/fl]; Phox2b[Cre/+] mice, which lack BMAL1 in all Phox2b-expressing chemoreceptor cells (hereafter called BKOP). BKOP mice lacked daily variation in HVR, similar to BMAL1 KO mice. However, unlike BMAL1 KO mice, BKOP mice exhibited circadian variations in VE and HCVR comparable to controls. These data indicate that the SCN regulates daily rhythms in VE, HVR, and HCVR, in part, through the synchronization of the molecular clock. Moreover, the molecular clock of Phox2b-expressing cells is specifically necessary for daily variation in the hypoxic chemoreflex. These findings suggest that disruption of circadian biology may undermine respiratory homeostasis, which, in turn, may have clinical implications for respiratory disease.",
