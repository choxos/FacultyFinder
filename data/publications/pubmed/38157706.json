  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Ankyloglossia or tongue tie is a condition where the lingual frenulum restricts tongue movement, negatively impacting breastfeeding. An increasing number of infants diagnosed with ankyloglossia may lead to unnecessary procedures. To limit the overtreatment of this problem, we established a specialist clinic to provide the best available evidence-based care to the mother-infant dyad. METHODS: We discuss the development of a specialist tongue tie assessment clinic in our unit. RESULTS: From January to October 2023, there were 162 visits to the clinic by 157 patients. During this time, there were 96 frenotomies performed. CONCLUSIONS: The mother-infant dyad is a vulnerable patient group. Establishing a specialist tongue tie assessment clinic with otolaryngology and lactation expertise provides the best available evidence-based care.",
