  "title": "Banded Sleeve Gastrectomy and One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass/Mini-gastric Bypass for Treatment of Obesity: a Retrospective Cohort Comparative Study with 6 years follow-up.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Banded sleeve gastrectomy (BSG), a modification of the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (SG), and one anastomotic gastric bypass/mini-gastric bypass (OAGB/MGB), a modification to the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), have been reported to enhance weight loss and minimize significant weight regain when compared with the SG and RYGB respectively. However, there has not been any report or study comparing these two operations. OBJECTIVE: We did a retrospective cohort study comparing these two operations and present a review and analysis with follow-up for 6Â years. METHOD: A review of all the operations performed at MBRSC in 2011 from a prospectively maintained database was done. Patients who had either a BSG or OAGB/MGB were identified. Data on the patients' profile, co-morbid conditions, perioperative complications, late complications, weight loss, resolution of comorbidities, and changes in quality of life (QLF) were collected reviewed and analyzed. RESULT: Sixty-eight patients were identified who had a primary BSG and 55 who had an OAGB/MGB in 2011. The follow-up rate, the age, BMI, and gender composition were similar in both groups. There were more patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the BSG group than in the OAGB/MGB group (44.1% vs. 27.2%). The incidences of hypertension (HTN) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) were higher in the OAGB/MGB group (62% vs. 36% and 96.3% vs. 2.9% respectively). The weight loss was faster in the OAGB/MGB group in the first year, but by the sixth year, the weight loss was slightly higher in the BSG group (84% vs. 79%). Resolution rate of T2D and HTN was higher after the OAGB/MGB group, 86.6% vs. 75.7% and 85.3% vs. 64.0% respectively. There was a 20% incidence of nutrient deficiencies in OAGB/MGB group and none in the BSG group. CONCLUSION: Both operations produced excellent weight loss and maintenance in the short to intermediate term. There was better resolution of T2D and HTN after OAGB/MGB at the expense of a higher incidence of nutrient deficiency and some protein caloric malnutrition. There is need for prospective and larger series studies to confirm these findings.",
