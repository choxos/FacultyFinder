  "abstract": "Sterubin, a flavanone is an active chemical compound that possesses neuroprotective activity. The current investigation was intended to assess the sterubin effect in scopolamine-activated Alzheimer's disease. The rats were induced with scopolamine (1.5 mg/kg) followed by treatment with sterubin (10 mg/kg) for 14 days. Behavioural analysis was predictable by the Y-maze test and Morris water test. Biochemical variables like nitric oxide acetylcholinesterase, Choline acetyltransferase, antioxidant markers like superoxide dismutase, glutathione transferase, malondialdehyde, catalase, and myeloperoxidase activity, neuroinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappa B, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL-1β), and IL-6 were measured. The result stated that sterubin reversed the oxidative stress parameters, increased motor performance, and lowered the inflammatory markers in scopolamine-induced rats. The study demonstrated that sterubin possesses neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties which can be used as a beneficial medication in AD.",
