  "title": "Editorial Commentary: Defining Proficiency in Hip Arthroscopic Surgery Is Facing Its Own Learning Curve.",
  "abstract": "The learning curve of hip arthroscopy has been described as steep. A wide range, between 30 and 520 cases, has been gathered as the learning curve before complications are minimized. While the precise number of cases required for proficiency has remained elusive, the heterogeneity in surgeon profile and baseline training can serve as an explanation. Moreover, as caseload increases, case complexity, revision surgeries, and outside referrals may begin to consume the greater-volume surgeon. While the learning curve remains hard to define, innovations in surgical training hold the promise of improving proficiency. Regardless of career stage, hip arthroscopists can still expect improved patient outcomes with appropriate indications and a properly executed procedure.",
