  "title": "Antihyperlipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic effects of Cymbopogon jwarancusa in high-fat high-sugar diet model.",
  "abstract": "Hyperlipidemia is the root cause for development of atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and cerebral palsy. Cymbopogon jwarancusa is an aromatic grass (Rusha grass, khavi grass) belonging to family Poaceaea. C. jwarancusa essential oil is famous for its use in perfumery, soaps cosmetics, detergents, medicine and pharmaceuticals. The anti-pyretic, anti-fungal, antibacterial, anti-oxidant and cytotoxic activities of C. jwarancusa have been reported in literature. In the present study different doses of C. jwarancusa extract have been investigated for anti-hyperlipidemic and anti-hyperglycemic activities in high-fat high sugar diet model in rats. Hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia were assessed by measuring body weight, serum lipid profile and fasting blood glucose levels. Administration of ethanol leaves extract of C. jwarancusa exhibited significant dose-dependent reduction in body weight, lipid parameters and blood sugar levels. Hence it may be concluded that C. jwarancusa aids in ameliorating hyperlipidemic, hyperglycemic conditions and has potential to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.",
