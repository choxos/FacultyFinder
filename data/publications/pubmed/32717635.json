  "title": "Serum albumin mediates the effect of multiple per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances on serum lipid levels.",
  "abstract": "Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetically manufactured chemicals recognized to be toxic, bioaccumulative, and persistent. Previous studies on PFAS exposure and serum lipid levels have mainly focused on individual PFASs; however, the influence of multiple-PFAS exposure on the serum lipid profile remains unclear. This study was performed to evaluate the combined effects of multiple PFASs on serum lipid levels. Based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2011-2014), we first established a linear regression model to estimate the association between single-PFAS exposure and the serum lipid profile. Then, a weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression model and a Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) model were used to evaluate the effects of multiple-PFAS exposure on the serum lipid profile. A mediating effect model was used to assess how albumin mediates these effects. We found that PFASs were significantly associated with the levels of serum lipids, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol (TC). The WQS index was significantly correlated with the levels of HDL (β: 2.03, 95% CI: 0.74-3.32, P-value = 0.002), LDL (β: 4.16, 95% CI: 1.07-7.24, P-value = 0.008) and TC (β: 6.54, 95% CI: 3.00-10.1, P-value < 0.001). In the BKMR analysis, our results demonstrated that the effect of PFASs on serum lipids increased significantly when the concentrations of the PFASs were at their 60th percentiles or above compared to those at their 50th percentile. Mediation analysis showed that albumin mediated the effects of selected PFASs on the levels of serum lipids except for triglycerides (TG). PFAS exposure was correlated with the levels of serum lipids, and this correlation was mediated by albumin. Our results suggest that a comprehensive evaluation of multi-PFAS exposure could better characterize real-life exposure compared with single-PFAS exposure.",
