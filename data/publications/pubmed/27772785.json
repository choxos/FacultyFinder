  "title": "Oxidative damage to myelin proteins accompanies peripheral nerve motor dysfunction in aging C57BL/6 male mice.",
  "abstract": "Aging is associated with a decline in peripheral nerve function of both motor and sensory nerves. The decline in function of peripheral sensorimotor nerves with aging has been linked to sarcopenia, the age-related decline in muscle mass and function that significantly compromises the quality of life in older humans. In this study, we report a significant increase in oxidized fatty acids and insoluble protein carbonyls in sciatic nerves of aged C57BL/6 male mice (28-30mo) that exhibit a profound decline in motor nerve function and degenerative changes in both axon and myelin structure, compared to young mice (6-8mo). Our data further suggests that this age-related loss of function of peripheral motor nerves is likely precipitated by changes in mechanisms that protect and/or repair oxidative damage. We predict that interventions that target these mechanisms may protect against age-related decline in peripheral sensorimotor nerve function and likely improve the debilitating outcome of sarcopenia in older humans.",
