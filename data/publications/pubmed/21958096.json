  "title": "Using health technology assessment to support evidence-based decision-making in Canada: an academic perspective.",
  "abstract": "Health technology assessment (HTA) adopts a multidisciplinary approach to comprehensively assess safety, efficacy, effectiveness, economic and organizational impact, and any potential social and ethical implications associated with adoption and diffusion of a technology in a healthcare system. Canada was one of the first pioneers in using HTA as a research tool to support evidence-based decision-making. This article describes the current application of HTA in Canada, with a focus on some federal and Ontario initiatives in which the authors have extensive knowledge and experience to illustrate how academic researchers conduct HTA in collaboration with decision makers. Some issues and challenges are also highlighted that will hopefully stimulate a broader discussion among HTA stakeholders to move HTA forward.",
