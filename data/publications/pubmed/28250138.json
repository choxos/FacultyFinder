  "title": "Primary Prevention of Myocardial Infarction in Rheumatoid Arthritis Using Aspirin: A Case-crossover Study and a Propensity Score-matched Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease, which is their leading cause of death. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the efficacy of aspirin (ASA) as primary prevention. We evaluated whether a protective association exists between ASA and myocardial infarction (MI) in RA subjects. METHODS: In the United Kingdom, persons age ≥ 60 years receive free ASA by prescription and 75% of use is by prescription. Subjects ≥ 60 years with RA in the population-based The Health Improvement Network database constituted our study population. We excluded patients with history of MI, angina, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or coronary artery procedures. Our main outcome was the occurrence of fatal and nonfatal MI. We performed a case-crossover study with each subject contributing a hazard period and a control period 90 days prior to the MI. In addition, to minimize confounding by indication, a propensity score (PS)-matched cohort study was performed, considering all patients with RA with an incident prescription of low-dose ASA as our exposed group. RESULTS: We did not find a protective effect in the case-crossover study (OR 1.83, 95% CI 0.71-4.71), with 55 subjects exposed in the hazard period and 44 in the control period. Similarly, among 1836 subjects included in the PS-matched cohort study (918 ASA users and 918 ASA non-users), we did not find a protective effect of low ASA on MI (HR 1.39, 95% CI 0.87-2.23). CONCLUSION: We did not find a protective effect of ASA on MI in patients with RA when used as primary prophylaxis.",
