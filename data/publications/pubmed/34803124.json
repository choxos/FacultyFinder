  "title": "T1R3 homomeric sweet taste receptor negatively regulates insulin-induced glucose transport through Gαs-mediated microtubules disassembly in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
  "abstract": "T1R3 is a class C G protein-coupled receptor family member that forms heterodimeric umami and sweet taste receptors with T1R1 and T1R2, respectively, in the taste cells of taste buds. T1R3 is expressed in 3T3-L1 cells in homomeric form and negatively regulates adipogenesis in a Gαs-dependent but cAMP-independent manner. Although T1R3 expression is markedly upregulated during adipogenesis, its physiological role in mature adipocytes remains obscure. Here, we show that stimulation of T1R3 with sucralose or saccharin induces microtubule disassembly in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The effect was reproduced by treatment with cholera toxin or isoproterenol but not with forskolin. Treatment with sucralose or saccharin for 3 h inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by 32% and 45% in differentiated adipocytes, respectively, similar to the inhibitory effect of nocodazole (by 33%). Isoproterenol treatment inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose transport by 26%, whereas sucralose did not affect the intrinsic activity of the glucose transporter, indicating that it inhibited insulin-induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Immunostaining analysis showed that insulin-stimulated GLUT4 accumulation on the plasma membrane was abrogated in sucralose-treated cells, in association with depolymerization of microtubules. Sucralose-mediated inhibition of GLUT4 translocation was reversed by the overexpression of dominant-negative Gαs (Gαs-G226A) or knockdown of Gαs. Additionally, membrane fractionation analysis showed that sucralose treatment reduced GLUT4 levels in the plasma membrane fraction from insulin-stimulated adipocytes. We have identified a novel non-gustatory role for homomeric T1R3 in adipocytes, and activation of the T1R3 receptor negatively regulates insulin action of glucose transport via Gαs-dependent microtubule disassembly.",
