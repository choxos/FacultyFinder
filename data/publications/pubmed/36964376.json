  "title": "Managing tooth wear with respect to quality of life: an evidence-based decision on when to intervene.",
  "abstract": "Patients with more severe forms of tooth wear may require restorative rehabilitation. The decision to commence treatment must be taken carefully and there are a multitude of factors to consider. Alongside the clinical signs and symptoms typically associated with tooth wear, there is also the need to assess the impact of the condition on the patient's oral health-related quality of life. As part of the discussions relating to the attainment of informed consent for the restoration of the worn dentition, not only is it relevant to appropriately appraise the risks, benefits, costs, reasonable alternatives and likely prognosis of the proposed treatments, but to also elaborate on the expected impact of the intervention on the patient's oral health-related quality of life. The aim of this article is to review the evidence relating to the impact of the quality of life with the management of tooth wear, with the introduction of the concept of an evidence-based approach to decision-making when planning care.",
