  "title": "Dutch Nationwide Cohort Experience with a New PROMs Set in Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery: BODY-Q Obesity Module.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patient-reported outcomes are important as obesity is a chronic disease with a substantial impact. A multidisciplinary task force selected six scales (48 questions) from the validated BODY-Q questionnaire. This subset was gradually introduced and evaluated in a mandatory nationwide registry. The focus was to assess the scale's module results and its feasibility in a quality registry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All Dutch patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2019 and 2022 were selected. Completed questionnaires of RAND-36, EQ-5D-5L, and BODY-Q were reviewed with baseline and 1-year results. Uni- and multivariable regression analyses were performed to assess the relationship between baseline characteristics and quality of life scores over time. RESULTS: A total of 10,972 patients completed at least one BODY-Q scale. The lowest score was on the body image scale preoperatively (28.2, SD 20.9) and the highest on the social scale postoperatively (76.2, SD 18.8). A representative group of 510 patients with repeated measurements showed the most improvement on the body image scale (+ 32.2) followed by physical function (+ 26.3). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed a significant influence, primarily for gender, age, and BMI on BODY-Q scores. Score improvement for BODY-Q was mainly driven by weight loss, while EQ-5D-5L and RAND-36 showed no clear pattern. Comparing the three questionnaires showed significant correlations for physical and social function only. CONCLUSION: The BODY-Q obesity module demonstrates potential as a relevant PROM for inclusion in a quality registry. BODY-Q scores provide a foundation for future research, with notable improvements in quality of life observed, particularly in the body image and physical function scales.",
