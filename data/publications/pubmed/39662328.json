  "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common and difficult to manage. Although experimental data suggest that antidepressants may reduce BPSD, the results are inconclusive. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of antidepressants monotherapy for treating BPSD. We searched 10 cross-disciplinary electronic databases from inception to October 2023.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants versus placebo for treating BPSD were included. The primary outcome was change in total neuropsychiatric symptom scale scores. Secondary outcomes included changes on agitation and psychosis subscale scores, change in total score of Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE). Tolerability outcomes included incidences and discontinuations due to adverse events. Finally, 8 RCTs including 676 patients were identified. We found a small beneficial effect of antidepressants on overall BPSD However, when trials with potential high-dose citalopram were excluded, no improvement was observed. No significant effects were detected on agitation and cognition. Currently there is no clear evidence of a beneficial effect of currently available antidepressants on overall BPSD and in particular agitation. Notably, clinician should be cautious of the potential risk of arrhythmias, dizziness and diarrhea when prescribing an antidepressant.",
