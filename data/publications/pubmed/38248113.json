  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: little is known about the incidence and characteristics of multisystem immune-related adverse events (irAEs) associated with dual-agent ipilimumab and nivolumab use. METHODS: A retrospective cohort review was completed that included cancer patients seen at the Juravinski Cancer Centre who received at least one dose of ipilimumab and nivolumab from 2018 to 2022. Patient characteristics, cancer types, and irAEs were recorded. Multivariate logistic and cox regressions were completed, comparing those who developed multisystem irAEs, single irAE, and no irAE. RESULTS: A total of 123 patients were included in this study. Out of 123 patients, 72 (59%) had melanoma, 50/123 (41%) had renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and 1/123 (1%) had breast cancer. Multisystem irAEs were seen in 40% of the overall cohort. The most common irAE type was dermatitis (22%), followed by colitis (19%) and hepatitis (17%). CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that multisystem irAEs are prevalent amongst patients receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab. It is important for both physician education and the counseling and consent of patients to monitor the potential for multiple irAEs.",
