  "title": "Exploratory neuroimmune profiling identifies CNS-specific alterations in COVID-19 patients with neurological involvement.",
  "abstract": "One third of COVID-19 patients develop significant neurological symptoms, yet SARS-CoV-2 is rarely detected in central nervous system (CNS) tissue, suggesting a potential role for parainfectious processes, including neuroimmune responses. We therefore examined immune parameters in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood samples from a cohort of patients with COVID-19 and significant neurological complications. We found divergent immunological responses in the CNS compartment, including increased levels of IL-12 and IL-12-associated innate and adaptive immune cell activation. Moreover, we found increased proportions of B cells in the CSF relative to the periphery and evidence of clonal expansion of CSF B cells, suggesting a divergent intrathecal humoral response to SARS-CoV-2. Indeed, all COVID-19 cases examined had anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in the CSF whose target epitopes diverged from serum antibodies. We directly examined whether CSF resident antibodies target self-antigens and found a significant burden of CNS autoimmunity, with the CSF from most patients recognizing neural self-antigens. Finally, we produced a panel of monoclonal antibodies from patients' CSF and show that these target both anti-viral and anti-neural antigens-including one mAb specific for the spike protein that also recognizes neural tissue. This exploratory immune survey reveals evidence of a compartmentalized and self-reactive immune response in the CNS meriting a more systematic evaluation of neurologically impaired COVID-19 patients.",
