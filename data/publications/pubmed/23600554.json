  "title": "Bone mineral density in adolescents with eating disorders exposed to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",
  "abstract": "Retrospective chart review was used to collect data from adolescents seen in a specialized eating disorder program over an 11-year period in order to investigate any association between exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and bone mineral density (BMD). SSRI users were matched with controls based on age (within 1.5 years), gender, eating disorder diagnosis, and percent ideal body weight (within 5%), resulting in a sample of 31 pairs. SSRI users had significantly lower BMD z-scores, compared to controls (-1.094 vs. -0.516, p < .035), suggesting that exposure to SSRIs may be a risk factor for lowered BMD.",
