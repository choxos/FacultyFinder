  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The global epidemiology of gastroparesis is unknown. The European UEG and European Society for Neurogastroenterology and motility consensus defines Gastroparesis as a condition characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction, with a symptom pattern of nausea and/or vomiting and overlapping postprandial distress syndrome (PDS). Real-world evidence of this gastroparesis-like symptom pattern is a crucial step in understanding the epidemiology of gastroparesis. METHODS: In the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study, 54,127 respondents from 26 countries completed the Rome IV Diagnostic Questionnaire and variables associated with disorders of gut-brain interaction via Internet. We selected subjects with gastroparesis-like symptoms (GPLS) (nausea and/or vomiting ≥1 day/week and simultaneous PDS). Patients reporting organic gastrointestinal disease, or fulfilling criteria for self-induced vomiting, cyclic vomiting or cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome were excluded. We determined prevalence, associated comorbidities, quality of life (QoL) (PROMIS Global-10), symptoms of anxiety and depression (PHQ-4), somatic symptoms (PHQ-12), and healthcare utilization. RESULTS: The global prevalence of GPLS was 0.9% overall and 1.3% among diabetic individuals. Subjects with GPLS showed frequent overlapping of epigastric pain syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome. Subjects with GPLS had significantly lower body mass index, QoL, more non-gastrointestinal somatic complaints, symptoms of anxiety and depression, higher medication usage and doctor visits in the overall and diabetic population, compared to subjects without these symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: GPLS are common worldwide and more common in diabetic patients. The symptom complex is associated with multiple aspects of illness and an increased healthcare consumption.",
