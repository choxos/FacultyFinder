  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To explore the relationship between adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) subtypes and neuropsychological functioning among U.S. soldiers. METHODS: Deploying soldiers (N = 260) completed the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS) Screener. Cognitive tests, a deployment health-history questionnaire, and the post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Checklist-Military Version were completed by subsamples of available participants. RESULTS: The prevalence of positive ASRS screens was 10.4%. ASRS scores were correlated with PTSD avoidance (n = 63, p = 0.37, p = 0.003), hyperarousal (n = 63, p = 0.25, p = 0.047), and total PTSD scores (n = 62, p = 0.33, p = 0.009); and all six moods (e.g., anger, anxiety) scale scores (n = 110; p = -0.37 to 0.43). ASRS was also correlated with scores on the match-to-sample (n = 110, p = -0.23, p = 0.014) and emotional Stroop (n = 108, p = -0.23, p = 0.016) tasks. In addition, a differential pattern between subtypes of ADHD was noted with regard to cognitive functioning, mood, and combat stress symptomatology. CONCLUSIONS: Although the results are preliminary given the sample size, the prevalence and comorbidities of ADHD appear to be similar among military and nonmilitary populations.",
