  "title": "High- versus low-intensity knowledge translation interventions for surgeons and rates of local tumour recurrence after rectal cancer surgery: an Ontario study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given that diagnostic, neoadjuvant treatment, and surgical approaches to rectal cancer have changed markedly in the last 25 years, knowledge translation (KT) may be useful to optimize rectal cancer surgery and improve patient outcomes. We sought to evaluate the impact of surgeon-directed KT to improve the quality of rectal cancer surgery on local tumour recurrence in Ontario. METHODS: Ontario's 14 health regions were previously categorized into 2 high-intensity and 12 low-intensity KT regions, based on KT methods (e.g., theory, audit, feedback), applied from 2006 to 2012 to improve the quality of rectal cancer surgery. In the high-intensity regions, efforts encouraged preoperative magnetic resonance imaging, appropriate radiation, and optimal surgical technique. We abstracted hospital chart data from across Ontario for a random sample of cases from 2010 to 2012 based on the respective population of a region and the relative hospital case volume within their region. The main study outcome was local tumour recurrence. RESULTS: In the high-intensity and low-intensity KT regions, we reviewed data from 523 (48.6%) and 557 (51.4%) patients, respectively. Descriptive variables (e.g., age, sex, tumour stage) were similar between groups. In the high- and low-intensity regions, the proportion of patients with a permanent stoma was 31.4% and 26.4% (p = 0.08), the proportion with positive radial margins was 8.0% and 6.1% (p = 0.2), and the proportion with local tumour recurrence was 6.3% and 5.2% (p = 0.2), respectively. The adjusted risk of time to local recurrence was similar in the high- and low-intensity KT regions (hazard ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.50-1.05). CONCLUSION: The use of resource-intense methods was not associated with improved patient outcomes, including local tumour recurrence. New approaches are needed to optimize the population-level quality of rectal cancer surgery.",
