  "title": "Effectiveness of Postoperative Single-shot and Continuous Transverse Abdominis Plane Block Compared to Conventional Analgesia in Hand-assisted Laparoscopic Live-donor Nephrectomy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of transverse abdominis plane (TAP) block in patients undergoing hand-assisted laparoscopic live-donor nephrectomy (HALN). We aimed to evaluate the analgesic effectiveness of TAP block as part of a multimodal pain management regimen in patients undergoing HALN. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of living kidney donors at our center between June 2016 and February 2020. HALNs were performed via a transperitoneal approach through a suprapubic incision. Additional laparoscopic ports were used in the upper midabdomen. In consenting donors, TAP block was performed postoperatively under ultrasound guidance with either a single-shot or continuous infusion of long-acting local anesthetic (0.2%-0.5% ropivacaine). All the patients received postoperative around-the-clock ketorolac and acetaminophen. RESULTS: Overall, 72 donors received the block (block group, 38 single-shot, 34 continuous), whereas 86 donors did not receive the block (control group). Baseline characteristics were comparable between the groups except for body weight (control: 71.8 ± 13.3 versus block: 77.8 ± 17.3 kg; P = 0.01) and intraoperative opioid dose (32.1 ± 9.6 versus 26.6 ± 10.7 morphine milligram equivalents; P < 0.001). After adjusting for baseline differences, postoperative opioid requirements were similar between the groups. When the baseline pain scale was adjusted for, there was no difference in the overall pain scale scores between the groups (P = 0.242). Subgroup analyses comparing single-shot or continuous TAP versus control did not show any differences. CONCLUSIONS: With the caveat of the retrospective nature of the study, the adjunctive effect of TAP block after transabdominal HALN was limited when other multimodal analgesia was used.",
