  "title": "Infantile seizures: infants are not just little children.",
  "abstract": "Seizure semiology in infants defies the typical characteristics and classification schemata that have been developed for older children and adults. A clear classification system is a necessary first step to facilitate proper diagnosis, choice of treatment, and determination of prognosis. This is an especially challenging task with seizures in infants. A semiologic system based upon simple descriptive terms has been proposed, which the neurologist and pediatrician will recognize as closer to clinical experience.",
