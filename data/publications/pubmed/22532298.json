  "abstract": "Patients with lung cancer have numerous and varying needs spanning across the cancer trajectory; however, only limited research has focused specifically on the pre-diagnosis phase. A multicentre cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the experience of lung cancer patients during the pre-diagnosis phase. High levels of anxiety were reported by many participants (45.6 %). Informational (32.1 %), and emotional (24.1 %) needs were reported as most important; the majority (89.0 %) reported these needs were met. Most participants sought information throughout, with many (38.6 %) rating their oncology health care providers to be the best source of information. The majority (70.0 %) reported that they were not directed to any resources to help address their anxiety. During pre-diagnosis, informational and emotional needs appear most important, and for the majority, these were reportedly met. Although many experienced high levels of anxiety, few were directed to resources to address it.",
