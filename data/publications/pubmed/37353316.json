  "title": "Regional variations in heart failure: a global perspective.",
  "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) is a global public health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. While there have been significant therapeutic advancements in HF over the last few decades, there remain major disparities in risk factors, treatment patterns and outcomes across race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, country and region. Recent research has provided insight into many of these disparities, but there remain large gaps in our understanding of worldwide variations in HF care. Although the majority of the global population resides across Asia, Africa and South America, these regions remain poorly represented in epidemiological studies and HF trials. Recent efforts and registries have provided insight into the clinical profiles and outcomes across HF patterns globally. The prevalence of HF and associated risk factors has been reported and varies by country and region ranges, with minimal data on regional variations in treatment patterns and long-term outcomes. It is critical to improve our understanding of the different factors that contribute to global disparities in HF care so we can build interventions that improve our general cardiovascular health and mitigate the social and economic cost of HF. In this narrative review, we hope to provide an overview of the global and regional variations in HF care and outcomes.",
