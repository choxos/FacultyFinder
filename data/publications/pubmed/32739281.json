  "title": "Promoting Osteoporosis Best Practices: A New Electronic Medical Record Tool.",
  "abstract": "Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcomes associated with osteoporotic fractures, they are not well investigated or treated. We developed an electronic Osteoporosis and Falls Assessment Form for integration within electronic medical records (EMR) with the aim to improve osteoporosis-related care in family practice. We examined usage and collected usability feedback from 37 physicians. A medical record review was used to assess tool usage over a 6-month period after which all participants completed a survey to assess their perceptions of the tool. The tool was used at least once by 22 (59%) physicians with 119 patients. Most users reported that it enhanced their practice (64%) and they intended to use it in the future (71%). Time constraints, complexity, and requirements to manually enter sections were identified as barriers to use. Lessons learned will inform improvements, which, given the perceived value of this tool, will likely improve uptake.",
