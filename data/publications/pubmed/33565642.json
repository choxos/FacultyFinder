  "title": "Effect of a virtual self-management intervention for atrial fibrillation during the outbreak of COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: As the pandemic continues to unfold, effective, technology-based solutions are needed to help patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) maintain their health and well-being during the outbreak of COVID-19. METHODS: This single-center, pilot study investigated the effects of a 4-week (eight sessions) virtual AF self-management program. Questionnaires were completed at baseline and 1 week after the intervention, and assessed AF knowledge, adherence to self-management behaviors, mental health, physical function, and disease-specific quality of life in patients with AF. Secondary outcomes included knowledge of COVID-19, intervention, acceptability, and satisfaction. RESULTS: Of 68 patients who completed baseline questionnaires, 57 participated in the intervention and were included in the analysis (mean age of 73.4 ± 10.0 years, 60% male). Adherence to AF self-monitoring behaviors, including monitoring their heart rate (p < .001), heart rhythm (p = .003), and blood pressure (p = .013) were significantly improved at the end of the intervention compared with baseline. Symptom identification (p = .007) and management (p < .001) also improved. Reductions in sleep disturbance (p < .001), anxiety (p = .014), and depression (p = .046) were also observed. Misinformation and inaccurate beliefs about COVID-19 were significantly reduced at the end of the intervention compared with baseline. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that a virtual patient education program could have beneficial effects on adherence to guideline-recommend self-care of AF, emotional wellbeing, physical function, and knowledge of COVID-19 in patients with AF. Future randomized studies in larger samples are needed to determine the clinical benefits of the intervention.",
