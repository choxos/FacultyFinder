  "title": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase modulates vascular endothelial growth factor-mediated angiogenesis.",
  "abstract": "Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), the first enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, is the principal intracellular source of NADPH. NADPH is utilized as a cofactor by vascular endothelial cell nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) to generate nitric oxide (NO*). To determine whether G6PD modulates NO*-mediated angiogenesis, we decreased G6PD expression in bovine aortic endothelial cells using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to G6PD or increased G6PD expression by adenoviral gene transfer, and we examined vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and capillary-like tube formation. Deficient G6PD activity was associated with a significant decrease in endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation, whereas increased G6PD activity promoted these processes. VEGF-stimulated eNOS activity and NO* production were decreased significantly in endothelial cells with deficient G6PD activity and enhanced in G6PD-overexpressing cells. In addition, G6PD-deficient cells demonstrated decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS compared with cells with normal G6PD activity, whereas overexpression of G6PD enhanced phosphorylation of Flk-1/KDR, Akt, and eNOS. In the Pretsch mouse, a murine model of G6PD deficiency, vessel outgrowth from thoracic aorta segments was impaired compared with C3H wild-type mice. In an in vivo Matrigel angiogenesis assay, cell migration into the plugs was inhibited significantly in G6PD-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice, and gene transfer of G6PD restored the wild-type phenotype in G6PD-deficient mice. These findings demonstrate that G6PD modulates angiogenesis and may represent a novel angiogenic regulator.",
