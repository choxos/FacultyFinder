  "title": "Have outcomes of trauma in centenarians changed in the last 15 years?",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Centenarians are an often forgotten and under-reported group. Trauma in this population is a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality. 15 years ago, a small observational study examined the outcomes of trauma in centenarians in a single trauma unit, concluding that age alone should not be a determinant of treatment. Following implementation of national standards of care for trauma patients in older adults, this study re-examined outcomes in centenarians admitted secondary to trauma to assess if outcomes have changed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study examining patients aged over 100 years who had been admitted with trauma to an acute district general hospital and trauma unit. Patients were admitted from January 2020 to January 2022. Outcomes investigated included duration of hospital stay, complications, and mortality at three timepoints (inpatient, 30 days, 12 months). We compared this cohort to the cohort 15 years ago to assess for changes in outcomes. RESULTS: 29 patients met our eligibility criteria in this cohort. Common presenting injuries included hip fracture (13), pelvic ring fractures (8) and head injuries (8). There was significantly higher inpatient mortality within our cohort between patients who underwent operative versus non-operative treatment, but no significant difference in duration of hospital stay. There was no significant change in duration of hospital stay, inpatient mortality, or mortality at 30 days and 12 months between this cohort and 15 years ago. CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of centenarians admitted secondary to trauma have been maintained but not improved in the last 15 years in our centre. Following this we must consider if more must be done to improve outcomes in this underreported but growing patient demographic.",
