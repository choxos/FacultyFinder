  "title": "Continuing the conversation: practical strategies to enable acceptable and feasible health research in prisons.",
  "abstract": "Within the unique structural, procedural, and social contexts of prisons, there are substantial challenges to conducting health research. Sharing approaches that facilitate study planning and implementation could support future research and foster critical discussion regarding best practices. During a qualitative study, we developed strategies to navigate the challenges of conducting research with participants who were currently incarcerated in prisons across Canada, including in participant recruitment, participation, and benefits. We found that creativity, flexibility, and responsiveness were key to surmounting barriers, mitigating risks, and optimizing study value. Our findings can be of value to other people conducting health research in prisons.",
