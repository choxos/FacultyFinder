  "title": "The effect of micro-particle curcumin on chronic kidney disease progression: the MPAC-CKD randomized clinical trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Curcumin is a commonly used herbal supplement with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties. Animal studies and small human trials suggest that curcumin reduces albuminuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Micro-particle curcumin is a new, more bioavailable formulation of curcumin. METHODS: To determine whether micro-particle curcumin versus placebo slows the progression of albuminuric CKD we conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with 6-month follow-up. We included adults with albuminuria [a random urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/mmol (265 mg/g) or a 24-h urine collection with more than 300 mg of protein] and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) between 15 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 within the 3 months before randomization. We randomly allocated participants 1:1 to receive micro-particle curcumin capsules (90 mg/day) or matching placebo for 6 months. After randomization, the co-primary outcomes were the changes in albuminuria and the eGFR. RESULTS: We enrolled 533 participants, but 4/265 participants in the curcumin group and 15/268 in the placebo group withdrew consent or became ineligible. The 6-month change in albuminuria did not differ significantly between the curcumin and placebo groups [geometric mean ratio 0.94, 97.5% confidence interval (CI) 0.82 to 1.08, P = .32]. Similarly, the 6-month change in eGFR did not differ between groups (mean between-group difference -0.22 mL/min/1.73 m2, 97.5% CI -1.38 to 0.95, P = .68). CONCLUSIONS: Ninety milligrams of micro-particle curcumin daily did not slow the progression of albuminuric CKD over 6 months. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02369549.",
