  "title": "Genetic data of 22 autosomal STR loci in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan and Gilgit Baltistan population of Pakistan using PowerPlex® fusion system.",
  "abstract": "In this study we have provided forensic genetic data of 22 autosomal STRs for Pakhtun, Balochi and Balti population of Pakistan in total of 601 samples. Among these loci, Penta E was found the most discriminatory in all groups and allele 15 was observed most frequent at D22S1045 in Balti whereas in other two populations allele 8 was more common at TPOX. The combined power of discrimination, combined power of exclusion and the combined matching probability was calculated as 0.999999999999999999999999998385, 0.999999988089728 and 1.615 × 10[-27] respectively. Based on population differentiation test, significant differences were observed when compared with other populations however, phylogenetic analysis revealed close genetic associations among Pakistani Populations.",
