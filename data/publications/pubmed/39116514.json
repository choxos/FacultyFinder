  "title": "Safety of vaginal surgery for early-stage cervical cancer: A retrospective multicenter cohort study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Abdominal Radical hysterectomy (ARH) with pelvic lymph node assessment is considered the standard treatment for early-stage cervical cancer. Accepted routes have previously included laparoscopic or robotic approaches (LRH). Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal or vaginal radical hysterectomy (LVRH) are performed in some centers. The objective of this study is to compare surgical and oncological outcomes of LVRH, to laparoscopic and abdominal approaches. DESIGN PATIENTS SETTING: A retrospective multicenter analysis of consecutive cervical cancer cases who underwent a radical hysterectomy between 2007 and 2017 in eleven regional cancer centers across Canada. MEASUREMENTS: A comparison of patients stratified by surgical technique was undertaken. T-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-square were used to compare patient characteristics. Log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to compare recurrence and survival across surgical groups. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 1071 patients with cervical cancer stage IA1 with lymphovascular invasion to stage IIIC (FIGO 2018) <4 cm were identified. Postoperative complication rate was lowest for women undergoing LVRH (9.1 %, vs 18.3 % and 22.1 % for minimally invasive and open respectively). During follow up, 114 women recurred, and 70 women died. 5-year recurrence-free survival was 85.4 % for LRH, 89.4 % for ARH and 92.2 % for LVRH. LVRH was not found to be associated with a higher risk of recurrence or death than ARH on multivariable analysis (aHR for recurrence 0.62, CI 0.21-1.77; aHR for death 0.63, CI 0.14-2.77) CONCLUSION: In this retrospective study, vaginal or laparoscopy-assisted vaginal radical hysterectomy for cervical cancer was associated with favorable perioperative and oncological outcomes.",
