  "title": "Canadian Cardiovascular Society Consensus Conference: peripheral arterial disease - executive summary.",
  "abstract": "This Consensus Conference has been supported by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society. The process is dynamic, with intentional structure that requires peer review and feedback from cardiovascular specialists across Canada. The writing and review panel encompassed a broad range of specialists caring for the patient with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). PAD is an often asymptomatic, underdiagnosed, under-recognized and undertreated condition. It is associated with significant morbidity and cardiac mortality. Until recently, little attention has focused on the evaluation and treatment of the disease process itself. The goal of the present paper is to ensure better treatment, to reduce both morbidity and mortality in the patient with vascular disease and, importantly, to serve as a guide to the busy clinician. Although the focus is PAD, there are chapters on thoracic and abdominal aortic disease, renal arterial disease and the evidence supporting management. Screening and diagnostic techniques including history and physical examination as well as noninvasive imaging techniques are reviewed. Medical management for patients with vascular disease including prevention and risk reduction is graded based on evidence, including both pharmacological and nonpharmacological management strategies, followed by an introduction to newer percutaneous techniques. Finally, surgical treatment for claudication including new concepts on the perioperative risk assessment for patients undergoing major vascular surgery is discussed.",
