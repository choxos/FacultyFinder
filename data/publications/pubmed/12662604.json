  "abstract": "Objective. Differentiation between the diagnoses of absence seizures and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Predominantly Inattentive Type, is frequently confounded by similarities in symptom presentation. The purpose of the present study was to determine symptoms that would distinguish between the disorders.Methods. Prior to diagnosis, parents of children with absence seizures (n=17) or ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type (n=26), were administered the Attention Deficit Disorder Evaluation Scale-Home Version (ADDES-HV). A statistical model was developed based on age, gender, race, and items from the Inattentive Scale of the ADDES-HV.Results. Two items, \"does not complete homework\" and \"does not remain on task,\" correctly classified 40 of 43 children. Children with absence seizures were rated by their parents as having a low rate of occurrence of these behaviors.Conclusion. Lack of sustained attention distinguished between the groups and was much more prevalent in children with ADHD, Predominantly Inattentive Type.",
