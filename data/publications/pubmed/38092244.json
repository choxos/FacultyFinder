  "title": "Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Occurrence of Acute Complications of Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes and Overall Glycemic Management.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The association of diabetes, and COVID-19 infection has been studied extensively; however, the occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or hyperglycemic/hyperosmolar states (HHS) in adults during the lockdown has not been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to identify the impact of the lockdown on occurrence and severity of DKA/HHS admissions and glycemic management. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients admitted to Hamilton Health Sciences with a diagnosis of DKA or HHS from April to September 2019 (pre-lockdown) and from April to September 2020 (lockdown). Adult (â‰¥18 years old) nonpregnant patients with a single admission in the study period were included for study. RESULTS: There were 229 admissions related to diabetes, with 171 admissions meeting the inclusion criteria (n=92 pre-lockdown, n=79 lockdown). In the lockdown group, 51.8% of the patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus, with 96.2% of admissions secondary to DKA. When comparing the 2 periods, the lockdown group trended toward higher rates of death (5.4% vs 10.1%, p=0.247) and euglycemic DKA (17.6% vs 24.4%, p=0.403). There were more new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus in the lockdown group compared with the pre-lockdown group (7.3% vs 16.7%, p=0.230). The average glycated hemoglobin was lower in the lockdown group compared with the pre-lockdown group (11.8% vs 10.4%, p=0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, this study is among the first in Canada to assess the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on admissions due to DKA and HHS. Although no significant differences were noted in severity of admissions, there was a trend toward more new diagnoses of type 1 diabetes mellitus presenting in DKA during the lockdown period.",
