  "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reproducibly identified loci associated with plasma triglycerides (TG), HDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol. We sought to replicate these findings in a multiethnic population-based cohort using the curated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set found on the new Illumina cardiovascular disease (CVD) beadchip, which contains approximately 50,000 SNPs densely mapping approximately 2,100 genes, selected based on their potential role in CVD. The sample consisted of individuals with European (n = 272), South Asian (n = 330), and Chinese (n = 304) ancestry. Identity by state clustering successfully classified individuals according to self-reported ethnicities. Associations between TG and APOA5, TG and LPL, HDL and CETP, and LDL and APOE were all identified (P < 2 x 10(-6)). In 13 loci, associations with the same SNP or a proxy SNP were identified in the same direction as previously reported (P < 0.05). Assessing the cumulative number of risk-associated alleles at multiple replicated SNPs increased the proportion of explained lipoprotein variance over and above traditional variables such as age, sex, body mass index, and ethnicity. The findings indicate the potential utility of the Illumina CVD beadchip, but they underscore the need to consider meta-analysis of results from commonly studied clinical or epidemiological samples.",
