  "title": "Testing quality improvement interventions.",
  "abstract": "The quality of health care is in drastic need of improvement. Surgeons are key players in the health care delivery system, and as such, they should be involved by leading or participating in the improvements that should take place. This article posits some suggestions as to how surgeons can participate in the efforts to make the health care provided to patients better and make the system a better place to work for surgeons and for other health professionals. Participation in quality improvement (QI) initiatives has the potential to bring much personal satisfaction for surgeons who help the process to move forward, even though it takes some effort and even forces them to learn some new skills and attitudes to what can be accomplished by QI teams. This article provides a methodologic guide to conducting and evaluating QI research.",
