  "abstract": "Oesophagocutaneous fistula is a very rare disorder. No case of oesophagocutaneous fistula after blunt trauma has been reported. In this report we present a case of 25-year-old nursing student seen at the Lahore General Hospital, Lahore, with a history of blunt trauma to the neck. She was initially diagnosed with supra-sternal abscess. A few days after the incision and drainage of this abscess, she developed discharge of water and food particles from the wound site. It was investigated and diagnosed as oesophagocutaneous fistula. Her neck exploration was done and fistulous tract was found communicating with the upper mid-esophagus. The tract was excised and sent for biopsy. Histopathology revealed non- caseating granulomas with no evidence of malignancy. A gene X-pert was done to rule out tuberculosis and it came out to be negative. Postoperatively, the patient is living a normal life. This is the first of its kind case of oesophagocutaneous fistula reported from our part of the world.",
