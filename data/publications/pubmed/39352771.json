  "title": "Lost dwell time and cycler alarms in inpatient automated peritoneal dialysis at a tertiary care hospital.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Dwell time is a critical component of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) prescription, the stage at which transmembrane mass and fluid transfer occur. Loss of prescribed dwell time (LDT) can negatively influence the efficiency of APD. We investigated the incidence of LDT and related causes using APD in the acute care setting at a tertiary care center. METHODS: Retrospective analysis was conducted of all inpatients receiving APD treatments from 1 December 2021 to 1 June 2023. Patient demographics, comorbidities, laboratory, and treatment data were extracted from electronic medical records and a propriety database. RESULTS: N = 235 cycler treatments completed by 32 patients were included for analysis. The total LDT per treatment exceeding 30 minutes and 60 minutes occurred in 27% and 20% of all treatments. LDT of more than 10 minutes per each cycle exchange occurred in 26%. Session disruptions were caused by slow out-flow (55%), inadequate drain volumes (32%), patient line occlusions (20%), and priming errors (23%). The slow flow alarm requiring user intervention was reported to occur in about one-third of all treatments (31%). CONCLUSION: There was significant LDT and inadequate drain volume seen in about one-quarter and one-third of all inpatient APD treatments respectively. This can impact solute clearance and ultrafiltration.  Slow flow alarms were the most prevalent and the leading cause of LDT followed by inadequate drain volume. Future studies are required to investigate measures to reduce slow drain and improve drain volume in the hospital setting.   .",
