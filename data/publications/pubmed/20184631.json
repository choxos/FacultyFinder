  "title": "Race and renal function early after live kidney donation: an analysis of the United States Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network Database.",
  "abstract": "Among Americans, the risk for kidney disease is higher in individuals of African descent (AA) when compared with Caucasians. We considered whether there are similar racial differences in kidney function soon after donor nephrectomy. Of the 31,928 live kidney donors that donated between the years 2000 and 2005, 16,996 (53%) had post-donation serum creatinine recorded at a mean follow-up of 156 d (range 1-1410 d). A total of 14,525 (85%) were Caucasians and 2471 (15%) were AA. When compared with Caucasians, AA donors were more likely to be younger, heavier, and male, had a higher baseline serum creatinine and a shorter duration of follow-up. After accounting for these differences, the serum creatinine after donation and fractional rise in serum creatinine after donation were similar between the two groups (AA vs. Caucasian donors, 1.3 ± 0.3 vs. 1.2 ± 0.3 mg/dL; 53% vs. 45%) and the post-donation estimated glomerular filtration rate was also similar (57.2 ± 0.6 vs. 56.0 ± 0.2 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)). We observed no major clinical difference in glomerular filtration rate and ability to compensate for loss of renal mass soon after live kidney donation between Caucasian and AA donors.",
