  "title": "The Canadian experience with Durata and Riata ST Optim defibrillator leads: a report from the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society Device Committee.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The St. Jude Medical Riata family of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads has demonstrated a high rate of externalized conductors and electrical failure. OBJECTIVE: Given similar design elements of Durata to Riata, the purpose of this study was to assess the rates of failure of the Riata ST Optim and Durata lead families in Canada. METHODS: All Canadian ICD-implanting centers were invited to submit follow-up information on all Optim-coated ICD leads implanted. Electrical failure was defined as a rapid change in impedance or pacing capture threshold leading to lead revision, or oversensing due to noise. Externalized conductors were defined as appearance of conductor wires outside the lead body. Systematic fluoroscopic screening for externalized conductors was not performed. RESULTS: As of December 1, 2012, 15 of 25 centers provided data on 3981 leads (44% of those sold in Canada during the same timeframe): 3477 Durata and 504 Riata ST Optim leads. The most common model numbers were 7122 (1516 leads [38%]), 7121 (707 leads [18%]), and 7120 (622 leads [16%]). Mean follow-up duration from implant to December 1, 2012, was 4.47 ± 0.48 years for Riata ST Optim leads and 2.00 ± 1.10 years for Durata leads. The annual rate of lead failure was 0.27% per year for Riata ST Optim leads and 0.24% per year for Durata leads. No instances of externalized conductors were identified in the failed leads. No deaths were attributed to lead failure; however, 2 patients experienced inappropriate shocks due to lead failure. CONCLUSION: The overall electrical failure rates of the Riata ST Optim and Durata leads appear to be low, and no instances of externalized conductors were observed.",
