  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant therapy has significantly improved the 5-year overall survival (OS) of patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The CheckMate 159 trial showed that neoadjuvant therapy with a single-drug programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitor (nivolumab) achieved major pathological response (MPR) and pathological complete response (pCR) in 45% and 15%of participants, respectively. We conducted an open-label single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment of resectable NSCLC. METHODS: This study was conducted in a total of 2 hospitals in the Chinese cities of Xi'an and Chongqing, and included eligible patients over 18 years of age with clinically staged IIA-IIIB NSCLC. All patients were scheduled to receive surgery within 4-6 weeks after neoadjuvant treatment (3-4 cycles) consisting of PD-1 inhibitors combined with a conventional chemotherapy regimen on day 1 of each 21-day cycle. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients, 22 males, and 1 female with just one of them with no smoking habits) were diagnosed with NSCL C in a stage IIA (3 cases), IIB (3 cases), IIIA (8 cases), and IIIB (9cases) and no druggable driver mutations/translocations were addressed to receive neoadjuvant treatment between June 2018 and June 2020. The treatment was well tolerated with just 3 typical immune-related adverse events (hyperthyroidism, hyperglycemia, and rash) recorded. There was a partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) in 17 (73.9%) and 6 (26.1%) patients, with an overall response rate (ORR) of 73.9% according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v.1.1). Six of these patients resulted in pCR (30%) while ten of them showed a MPR (50%). Twenty patients underwent surgical resection after treatment, while further 3 refused surgery. Surgical procedure included video-assisted thoracoscopic resection (10 cases), Vinci Robot surgery (4 cases), and thoracotomy in 4 cases while there were secondary compliance-related thoracotomy in two cases. The pathology analysis revealed a R0 in 19 cases (19/20, 95%). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the neoadjuvant approach with chemotherapy and PD-1 blocking mAbs is safe and active in patients with resectable NSCLC where is associated with a promising high ORR, MPR and pCR.",
