  "title": "Population-Based Screening for Atrial Fibrillation.",
  "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and morbid arrhythmia. Stroke is a major hazard of AF and may be preventable with oral anticoagulation. Yet since AF is often asymptomatic, many individuals with AF may be unaware and do not receive treatment that could prevent a stroke. Screening for AF has gained substantial attention in recent years as several studies have demonstrated that screening is feasible. Advances in technology have enabled a variety of approaches to facilitate screening for AF using both medical-prescribed devices as well as consumer electronic devices capable of detecting AF. Yet controversy about the utility of AF screening remains owing to concerns about potential harms resulting from screening in the absence of randomized data demonstrating effectiveness of screening on outcomes such as stroke and bleeding. In this review, we summarize current literature, present technology, population-based screening considerations, and consensus guidelines addressing the role of AF screening in practice.",
