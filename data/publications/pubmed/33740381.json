  "title": "Repair of a Perforation Defect With Calcium Silicate-Based Cement Using an Internal Matrix.",
  "abstract": "This case report describes the nonsurgical endodontic management of a distolingual floor perforation in a mandibular first molar using an internal matrix and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) cement. The pulp chamber was properly cleaned, and after placement of a synthetic collagen material that served as a barrier at the level of furcation, MTA was used to repair the perforation defect. Root canal treatment was completed and the tooth was restored with a composite restoration followed by a porcelain-fused-to-metal crown.",
