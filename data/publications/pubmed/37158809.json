  "title": "The Influence of Cannabinoids on Drosophila Behaviors, Longevity, and Traumatic Injury Responses of the Adult Nervous System.",
  "abstract": "Introduction: The legalization of cannabis products has increased their usage in the United States. Among the ∼500 active compounds, this is especially true for cannabidiol (CBD)-based products, which are being used to treat a range of ailments. Research is ongoing regarding the safety, therapeutic potential, and molecular mechanism of cannabinoids. Drosophila (fruit flies) are widely used to model a range of factors that impact neural aging, stress responses, and longevity. Materials and Methods: Adult wild-type Drosophila melanogaster cohorts (w[1118]/+) were treated with different Δ[9]-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and CBD dosages and examined for neural protective properties using established neural aging and trauma models. The therapeutic potential of each compound was assessed using circadian and locomotor behavioral assays and longevity profiles. Changes to NF-κB pathway activation were assessed by measuring expression levels of downstream targets using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of neural cDNAs. Results: Flies exposed to different CBD or THC dosages showed minimal effects to sleep and circadian-based behaviors or the age-dependent decline in locomotion. The 2-week CBD (3 μM) treatment did significantly enhance longevity. Flies exposed to different CBD and THC dosages were also examined under stress conditions, using the Drosophila mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) model (10×). Pretreatment with either compound did not alter baseline expression of key inflammatory markers (NF-κB targets), but did reduce neural mRNA profiles at a key 4-h time point following mTBI exposure. Locomotor responses were also significantly improved 1 and 2 weeks following mTBI. After mTBI (10×) exposure, the 48-h mortality rate improved for CBD (3 μM)-treated flies, as were global average longevity profiles for other CBD doses tested. While not significant, THC (0.1 μM)-treated flies show a net positive impact on acute mortality and longevity profiles following mTBI (10×) exposure. Conclusions: This study shows that the CBD and THC dosages examined had at most a modest impact on basal neural function, while demonstrating that CBD treatments had significant neural protective properties for flies following exposure to traumatic injury.",
