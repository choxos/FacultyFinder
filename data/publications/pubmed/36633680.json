  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether intraoperative adjunctive EVD placement in patients with a posterior fossa tumor (PFT) led to improved surgical, radiographic, and clinical outcomes compared to those who did not receive an EVD. METHODS: Patients were grouped as those who underwent routine intraoperative adjunctive EVD insertion and those who did not at time of PFT resection. Patients who pre-operatively required a clinically indicated EVD insertion were excluded. Comparative analyses between both groups were conducted to evaluate clinical, radiological, and pathological outcomes. Odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were computed for post-operative outcomes. RESULTS: Fifty-five selected patients were included, 15 who had an EVD placed at the time of PFT resection surgery, and 40 who did not. Children without an EVD did not experience a higher rate of complications or poorer post-operative outcomes compared to those with an EVD placed during resection surgery. There was no significant difference in the degree of gross total resection (p = 0.129), post-operative CSF leak (p = 1.000), and post-operative hemorrhage (p = 0.554) between those with an EVD and those without. The frequency of new cranial nerve deficits post-operatively was higher in those with an EVD (40%) compared to those without (3%, p = 0.001). There was a trend towards more frequently observed post-operative hydrocephalus in the EVD group (p = 0.057). CONCLUSION: The routine use of EVD as an intraoperative adjunct in clinically stable pediatric patients with posterior fossa tumors and hydrocephalus may not be associated with improved radiological or clinical outcomes.",
