  "title": "Transfusion camp: A retrospective study of self-reported impact on postgraduate trainee transfusion practice.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal method of postgraduate transfusion medicine (TM) education remains understudied. One novel approach is Transfusion Camp, a longitudinal 5-day program that delivers TM education to Canadian and international trainees. The purpose of this study was to determine the self-reported impact of Transfusion Camp on trainee clinical practice. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of anonymous survey evaluations from Transfusion Camp trainees over three academic years (2018-2021) was conducted. Trainees were asked, \"Have you applied any of your learning from Transfusion Camp into your clinical practice?\". Through an iterative process, responses were categorized into topics according to program learning objectives. The primary outcome was the rate of self-reported impact of Transfusion Camp on clinical practice. Secondary outcomes were to determine impact based on specialty and postgraduate year (PGY). RESULTS: Survey response rate was 22%-32% over three academic years. Of 757 survey responses, 68% of respondents indicated that Transfusion Camp had an impact on their practice, increasing to 83% on day 5. The most frequent areas of impact included transfusion indications (45%) and transfusion risk management (27%). Impact increased as PGY increased with 75% of PGY-4+ trainees reporting impact. In multivariable analysis, the impact of specialty and PGY varied depending on the objective. DISCUSSION: The majority of trainees report applying learnings from Transfusion Camp to their clinical practice with variations based on PGY and specialty. These findings support Transfusion Camp as an effective means of TM education and help identify high-yield areas and gaps for future curriculum planning.",
