  "title": "Aesthetic resin onlay restorations: 'rationale and methods'.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Resin composite restorations have gained increasing popularity over the past two decades. This has been largely driven by a patient-orientated demand for the use of aesthetic restorative materials. It has occurred concomitantly with an improvement in the mechanical properties of available materials, and advances in our knowledge of resin bonding. Onlay restorations are advocated for a plethora of clinical applications. This paper considers the role of adhesive onlay restorations fabricated in resin composite in contemporary restorative practice, including the presentation of two case reports. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This case report describes a minimally invasive, aesthetic solution to provide cuspal coverage by means of either a direct or indirect resin composite onlay restoration, respectively.",
