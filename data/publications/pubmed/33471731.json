  "title": "Altered Brain Network Centrality in Patients with Diabetic Optic Neuropathy: A Resting-State FMRI Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have suggested that diabetic optic neuropathy (DON) independently increases the incidence of brain diseases like cerebral infarction and hemorrhage. In this study, voxel-level degree centrality (DC) was used to study potential changes in functional network brain activity in DON patients. METHODS: The study included 14 DON patients and 14 healthy controls (HCs) matched by age, sex, and weight. All subjects underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging. Receiver operating characteristic curves and Pearson correlation analysis were performed. RESULTS: The DC values of the left frontal mid-orb and right middle frontal gyrus/right frontal sup were significantly lower in DON patients compared to HCs. The DC value of the left temporal lobe was also significantly higher than in HCs. CONCLUSION: Three different brain regions show DC changes in DON patients, suggesting common optic neuropathy in the context of diabetes and providing new ideas for treating optic nerve disease in patients with long-term diabetes. ABBREVIATIONS: AUC = area under the curve; BCVA = best corrected visual acuity; DC = degree centrality; DON = diabetic optic neuropathy; fMRI = functional magnetic resonance imaging; HC = healthy control; LFMO = left frontal mid orb; LTL = left temporal lobe; RFS = right frontal sup; RMFG = right middle frontal gyrus; ROC = receiver operating characteristic.",
