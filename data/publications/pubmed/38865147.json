  "title": "Early In-Bed Cycle Ergometry in Mechanically Ventilated Patients.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Critical illness requiring invasive mechanical ventilation can precipitate important functional disability, contributing to multidimensional morbidity following admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). Early in-bed cycle ergometry added to usual physiotherapy may mitigate ICU-acquired physical function impairment. METHODS: We randomly assigned 360 adult ICU patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation to receive 30 minutes of early in-bed Cycling + Usual physiotherapy (n=178) or Usual physiotherapy alone (n=182). The primary outcome was the Physical Function ICU Test-scored (PFIT-s) at 3 days after discharge from the ICU (the score ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating better function). RESULTS: Cycling began within a median (interquartile range) of 2 (1 to 3) days of starting mechanical ventilation; patients received 3 (2 to 5) cycling sessions for a mean (±standard deviation) of 27.2 ± 6.6 minutes. In both groups, patients started Usual physiotherapy within 2 (2 to 4) days of mechanical ventilation and received 4 (2 to 7) Usual physiotherapy sessions. The duration of Usual physiotherapy was 23.7 ± 15.1 minutes in the Cycling + Usual physiotherapy group and 29.1 ± 13.2 minutes in the Usual physiotherapy group. No serious adverse events occurred in either group. Among survivors, the PFIT-s at 3 days after discharge from the ICU was 7.7 ± 1.7 in the Cycling + Usual physiotherapy group and 7.5 ± 1.7 in the Usual physiotherapy group (absolute difference, 0.23 points; 95% confidence interval, -0.19 to 0.65; P=0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Among adults receiving mechanical ventilation in the ICU, adding early in-bed Cycling to usual physiotherapy did not improve physical function at 3 days after discharge from the ICU compared with Usual physiotherapy alone. Cycling did not cause any serious adverse events.
