  "title": "Protective Effect of Fustin Against Ethanol-Activated Gastric Ulcer via Downregulation of Biochemical Parameters in Rats.",
  "abstract": "The fustin plant-derived bioflavonoid obtained from a common plant known as lacquer tree from family Anacardiaceae, formally known as Rhus verniciflua Stokes, is known to exert a variety of therapeutic properties. The current investigation proved the anti-ulcerative property of fustin on ethanol-induced gastric ulcers in an experimental animal model. The fustin 50 and 100 mg/kg was studied in an experimental rat model by performing an 8 day protocol. The ulcer index, pH, total acidic content, and biochemical parameters such as glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin-1β, prostaglandin E-2, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), myeloperoxidase, and nitric oxide (NO) in serum were measured. The gastric parameter such as ulcer index, pH, and acidic content was maintained in the fustin groups compared to the ethanol control group. Clinical presentation of gastric ulcers includes a significant increase in serum levels, GSH, SOD, and CAT and decreased MDA, TNF-α, interleukin-1β, and prostaglandin E-2 parameters in contrast to normal groups. The treatment regimen with fustin has significantly restored all serum parameters in test groups. The current study helps to develop reasonable phytochemical options for the innervations of chemical-induced gastric ulcers.",
