  "title": "Impact of Hearing Aids on Progression of Cognitive Decline, Depression, and Quality of Life Among People with Cognitive Impairment and Dementia.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is common in people with dementia (PwD) and a modifiable risk factor for cognitive decline. Recent studies revealed that hearing loss could cause social isolation and depression, which is associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is a lack of knowledge about the impact of the utilization of hearing aids on these outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether hearing aids use might be positively associated with the progression of cognitive function, depression, and HRQoL among PwD. METHODS: We analyzed two-year follow-up data from 258 PwD (≥70 years, living at home). Cognitive decline was measured with Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), depression using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and HRQoL with Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QoL-AD). The impact of hearing aid utilization on the progression of outcomes was assessed using multivariate regression models. RESULTS: 123 patients had hearing loss (47.7%), from which n = 54 (43.9%) used hearing aids. Patients with hearing loss were older and had a lower HRQoL than those without hearing loss. Use of hearing aids in patients with hearing loss was associated with a lower increase in depressive symptoms (b = -0.74, CI95 -1.48 --0.01, p = 0.047) over time as compared to those not using hearing aids. There was no effect on PwD's cognition, and the association with higher HRQoL was significant after one, but not consistently over two years. CONCLUSION: Early detection and intervention of presbycusis using hearing aids might improve mental health and HRQoL in dementia.",
