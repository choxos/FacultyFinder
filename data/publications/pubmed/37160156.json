  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To analyse changes in frequencies of test psychology examinations (TPE) relevant to detect change in dementia diagnosis in general (GP) and neuropsychiatric (NP) practices during the Covid 19 pandemic. METHODS: Cross-sectional study analysis comparing the number of patients aged ≥ 70 with at least one TPE in 908 GP and 107 NP-practices in 2018-2019 (prepandemic) and 2020-2021 (pandemic) using descriptive statisics and correlations. RESULTS: While there was a large decrease in TPE between 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 (- 18.4%) conducted in NP-practices, it remained stable in GP-practices (+ 2.6%). In both GP and NP, there was a strong correlation between the number of patients tested and newly diagnosed with dementia. CONCLUSION: TPE in performing in GP practices appears less susceptible to a pandemic-related decline in the provision compared to NP practices. Further research is needed to reveal the reasons for these differences.",
