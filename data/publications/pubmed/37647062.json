  "title": "Genetic Variants, Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels, and Sarcopenia: A Mendelian Randomization Analysis.",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Vitamin D deficiency is commonly associated with sarcopenia; however, the latest International Clinical Practice Guidelines for Sarcopenia do not recommend vitamin D supplementation for sarcopenia owing to a lack of an apparent therapeutic effect on the indices of sarcopenia among participants with replete vitamin D concentration (ie, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level >20 ng/mL) from randomized clinical trials. While there is consensus in all vitamin D guidelines that serum levels of 25(OH)D less than 10 ng/mL should be corrected, approximately 30% of the world population's 25(OH)D levels range from 10 to 20 ng/mL, and it remains unclear whether such suboptimal levels can maintain optimal health, including sarcopenia risk. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of serum 25(OH)D level, especially suboptimal levels, with sarcopenia risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide genetic association study was performed from August 2022 to February 2023 among the 295 489 unrelated European participants from the UK Biobank (2006-2010). Nonlinear and standard mendelian randomization analyses were used to examine the association of serum 25(OH)D concentration with sarcopenia risk. EXPOSURES: A weighted genetic risk score using 35 unrelated single-nucleotide variants from the UK Biobank and weights from the SUNLIGHT Consortium was selected as an instrumental variable for serum 25(OH)D concentration. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was sarcopenia, and the secondary outcomes consisted of grip strength, appendicular lean mass index, and gait speed. RESULTS: The final genetic analyses included 295 489 participants (mean [SD] age, 56.3 [8.1] years; 139 216 female [52.9%]). There was an L-shaped association between genetically predicted serum 25(OH)D concentration and sarcopenia risk. The risk of sarcopenia decreased rapidly as 25(OH)D concentration increased until 20 ng/mL and then leveled off. The odds ratio of sarcopenia for serum 25(OH)D level of 10 vs 20 ng/mL was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.17-2.59). Similar patterns were also observed when the association between serum 25(OH)D concentration and risks of each of the sarcopenia indices were evaluated. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this mendelian randomization genetic association study of adults in the UK Biobank, the findings supported a nonlinear association between suboptimal 25(OH)D levels and sarcopenia risk. Randomized clinical trials among participants with suboptimal 25(OH)D levels are required to verify the potential causality.",
