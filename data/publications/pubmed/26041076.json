  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess coronary artery disease (CAD) risk among obese young men without metabolic risk factors. DESIGN: A longitudinal study in a historical cohort. METHODS: Incident CAD during a median follow-up of 6.1 years was assessed among 31,684 young men (mean age 31.2 ± 5.7 years) of the Metabolic, Lifestyle and Nutrition Assessment in Young Adults (MELANY) cohort. Participants were categorized by BMI and the number of metabolic abnormalities (based on the Adult Treatment Panel-III). Metabolically healthy (MH) obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 30 kg/m(2) in the presence of normal blood pressure (BP) and normal levels of fasting glucose, triglyceride, and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-c) levels (n = 599; 1.9%). Cox proportional hazard models were applied. RESULTS: There were 198 new cases of CAD that were diagnosed during 209,971 person-years of follow-up, of which six cases occurred among MH obese. The incidence of CAD among MH lean, overweight, and obese participants was 0.23, 0.45, and 1.0/1000 person-years respectively. In a multivariable model adjusted for clinical and biochemical CAD risk factors, a higher CAD risk was observed among MH-obese (hazard ratio = 3.08; 95% CI = 1.10-8.68, P = 0.033), compared to MH-normal weight subjects. This risk persisted when BMI was treated as a time-dependent variable, or when fasting glucose, HDL-c, triglycerides, or BP were added to the model. Similar results were also obtained when a more permissive definition of MH was used. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity may continue to contribute to increased risk for incident CAD in young men even in the presence of a healthy metabolic profile.",
