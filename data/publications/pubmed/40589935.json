  "abstract": "Epigenome-wide association studies (EWASs) have emerged as a powerful approach to investigate how dietary exposures shape the epigenome and subsequently influence metabolic and cardiovascular health. A growing number of EWAS have examined the effects of various dietary factors, including overall dietary patterns, specific food groups, micronutrients, and food-related metabolites, on DNA methylation (DNAm) across diverse populations. In this review, we map the landscape of nutritional EWAS, identifying the types of dietary exposures studied, the genomic regions where epigenetic signals emerge, and overarching trends across studies. Across studies, consistent associations were reported at nine CpG sites in genes such as AHRR, CPT1A, and FADS2, particularly in relation to fatty acid consumption, and certain diet patterns. Biological pathways enriched included fatty acid metabolism and the PPAR signaling pathway. In conclusion, our review identified a pattern of epigenetic convergence that may underlie diet-related disease risk. While promising, key knowledge gaps were also noted, including limited longitudinal follow-up, unclear causal pathways, and underrepresentation of ethnic diversity. Moving forward, we highlighted several complementary approaches for translating nutritional EWAS findings into actionable public health and precision nutrition strategies, including integrating multi-omics, mediation analyses, and population-wide epigenetic risk profiling.",
