  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients who survive acute kidney injury (AKI) may receive fewer cardioprotective drugs. Our objective was to measure the difference in time to dispensing of evidence-based cardiovascular drugs in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI) with and without AKI. METHODS: This was a population-based cohort study of patients 66 years of age and older with a history of MI who survived a hospitalization complicated with AKI, propensity-score matched to patients without AKI. The primary outcome was time to outpatient dispensing of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)/angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), statin, or β-blocker within 1 year of hospital discharge. RESULTS: We identified 28,871 patients with AKI, of whom 21,452 were matched 1:1 to patients without AKI. In the matched cohort, mean age was 80 years, 40% were female, and 34% had an MI during the index hospitalization. AKI was associated with less frequent dispensing of all 3 cardiovascular drug classes within 1 year of hospital discharge (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR], 0.93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-0.95). This association was most pronounced in patients with stage 2 (sHR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.75-0.88) and stage 3 (sHR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.64-0.79) AKI. We observed less frequent dispensing of statins in patients with stage 2 (sHR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.81-0.92) and stage 3 (sHR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93) AKI and less frequent dispensing of β-blockers in patients with stage 3 AKI (sHR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94). CONCLUSION: In patients with a history of MI, survivors of AKI were less likely to receive prescriptions for ACEi/ARB, statins, or β-blockers within 1 year of hospital discharge. This association was most pronounced in patients with stages 2 and 3 AKI.",
