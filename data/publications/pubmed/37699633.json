  "title": "Development of practice-based quality indicators for the primary care of older adults: a RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method study protocol.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Older adults have high rates of primary care utilisation, and quality primary care has the potential to address their complex medical needs. Family physicians have different levels of knowledge and skills in caring for older patients, which may influence the quality of care delivery and resulting health outcomes. In this study, we aim to establish consensus on practice-based metrics that characterise quality of care for older primary care patients and can be examined using secondary, administrative data. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We describe a two-round RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method (RAM) study to assess the consensus of a technical expert panel. We will recruit pan-Canadian experts who demonstrate excellence in clinical practice or scholarship related to the primary care of older adults. A literature review will generate a candidate list of practice-based quality indicators. The first round aims to evaluate the appropriateness and importance of candidate indicators through an online questionnaire. We will then develop technical definitions for each endorsed indicator using ICES data holdings. Panellists will offer feedback on the technical definitions in a virtual synchronous meeting and provide ratings on the same criteria in a second questionnaire. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Our study has been approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (Project ID #15545). Findings will be disseminated via manuscripts, presentations and the lead author's thesis. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN17074347.",
