  "abstract": "This study shows excellent transcatheter aortic valve replacement hemodynamic mid-term durability, aligned with prior research up to 5-years. Long-term (10+ years) data are needed before treating young low-risk people with aortic stenosis. Data so far are excellent, indicating a prosperous future for this procedure in young patients.",
