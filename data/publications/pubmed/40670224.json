  "abstract": "The importance of genetics and genomics in general nephrology has rapidly ascended within the last decade. While the genetic literacy of all nephrologists must improve, there is a particular need to develop the next generation of leaders and educators in nephrology genetics. In this review, we summarize how nephrology genetics could fit into the nephrology landscape and discuss components of a nephrology genetics training program. We outline potential objectives and educational content for a nephrology genetics curriculum. Finally, we identify logistical challenges and potential solutions when educating the next-generation expert in nephrology genetics. Semin Nephrol 36:x-xx Â© 20XX Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",
