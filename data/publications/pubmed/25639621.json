  "title": "Enhancement and induction of HIV-1 infection through an assembled peptide derived from the CD4 binding site of gp120.",
  "abstract": "Contact between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and its target cell is initiated by the interaction of viral gp120 with cellular CD4. An assembled peptide (CD4bs-M) that presents the CD4 binding site of gp120 was previously shown to inhibit the gp120-CD4 interaction. Here, we demonstrate that CD4bs-M selectively enhances infection of cells with HIV-1, whereas infection with herpes simplex virus remains largely unaffected. The effects of CD4bs-M variants containing D-amino acids, or prolines at selected positions, point to the importance of side chain orientation and spatial orientation of this fragment. Furthermore, CD4bs-M was shown to assemble into amyloid-like fibrils that capture HIV-1 particles, which likely contributes to the infection-enhancing effect. Beyond infection enhancement, CD4bs-M enabled HIV-1 infection of CD4-negative cells, suggesting that binding of the peptide to gp120 facilitates interaction of gp120 with coreceptors, which might in turn enhance HIV-1 entry.",
