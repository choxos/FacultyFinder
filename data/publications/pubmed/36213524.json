  "title": "Opioid reduction and enhanced recovery in orthopaedic surgery (OREOS): A feasibility randomized controlled trial in knee replacement patients.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Total knee arthroplasties are the second most common surgery in Canada. Most patients recover well, but 20% or more still suffer from persistent pain and opioid use. Though opioids are an important part of perioperative pain management, their potential for long-term adverse effects is well recognized. Limiting opioids may be insufficient to overcome the issue of opioid overuse. Pain and opioid use are highly linked, so an effective alternative needs to address both issues. OBJECTIVES: The principal objective of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility. The clinical objectives are to determine the effects of a multicomponent care pathway on opioid-free pain control, persisting pain and opioid use, functional knee outcomes, quality of life, and return to function. METHODS: We will include adult patients scheduled for primary elective total knee arthroplasty. Patients in the intervention group will undergo a multicomponent intervention pathway that will be facilitated by an intervention coordinator linking each patient and their surgical/ perioperative team. The interventional pathway will include (1) preoperative education on pain and opioid use, (2) preoperative risk identification and mitigation using cognitive behavioral skills, (3) personalized postdischarge analgesic prescriptions, and (4) continued support for pain control and recovery up to 8Â weeks. Patients in the control group will receive the usual care at their institution. DISCUSSION: The overarching goal is to implement and evaluate a coordinated approach to clinical care to improve pain control and reduce harms, with an emphasis on patient-centered care and shared decision making.Trial Registration Number: NCT04968132 (informed consent/ research ethics board statement).",
