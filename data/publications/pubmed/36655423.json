  "title": "Associations of abdominal obesity with different types of bone fractures in adults: A systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies.",
  "abstract": "Findings on the association between abdominal obesity and hip fracture were summarized in a meta-analysis in 2017; however, no study has examined the dose-response association between abdominal fat indices and hip fracture. Also, we found no meta-analysis investigating other types of bone fractures including any vertebral fractures in relation to abdominal obesity. Therefore, the present systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies were conducted to examine the association between abdominal obesity and different types of bone fractures. A comprehensive literature search was done by searching PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar until October 2021. In total, 23 articles from prospective cohort studies with a total sample size of 3,456,631 participants were included. During the follow-up periods ranging between 4 and 26 years, 137,989 cases of bone fracture were recorded. After comparing the highest and lowest categories of abdominal fat indices, the summary relative risks (RRs) of any, hip, and vertebral fractures were 0.99 (95% CI: 0.81-1.20), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.82-1.43), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.05-1.33), respectively, indicating a significant positive association between abdominal obesity and risk of vertebral fracture. In the non-linear dose-response analysis, abdominal obesity based on the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was positively associated with an increased risk of hip fracture from 0.7 to 1.1 units of WHR. In the linear analysis, a 10 cm increase in waist circumference (WC) was associated with a 3% higher risk of vertebral fracture. We found no other dose-response association for other types of bone fractures. In conclusion, abdominal obesity may be associated with a higher risk of hip and vertebral fractures.",
