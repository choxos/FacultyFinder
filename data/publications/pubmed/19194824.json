  "title": "Thymosin beta-10 is aberrantly expressed in pancreatic cancer and induces JNK activation.",
  "abstract": "Thymosin beta-10 (T beta 10) has been shown to be associated with several cancers; however, its role in pancreatic cancer is not understood. The expression of T beta 10 was determined by immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The phosphorylation of JNK and the cytokine secretion was determined by using the Bio-Plex phosphoprotein and cytokines assays. Pancreatic cancer tissues and cells expressed higher amounts of T beta 10 than normal surrounding tissues and human pancreatic duct epithelial cells. Exogenous T beta 10 caused the phosphorylation of JNK and increased the secretion of cytokines interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-8 in BxPC-3 cells. T beta 10 might be a promising marker and a novel therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer.",
