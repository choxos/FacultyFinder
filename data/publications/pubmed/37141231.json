  "title": "Effect of weight loss on blood pressure changes in overweight patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "To determine quantitative differences between weight loss and changes in clinic blood pressure (BP) and ambulatory BP in patients with obesity or overweight, the authors performed a meta-analysis. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched up to June 2022. Studies that compared clinic or ambulatory BP with weight loss were included. A random effect model was applied to pool the differences between clinic BP and ambulatory BP. Thirty-five studies, for a total of 3219 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly reduced by 5.79 mmHg (95% CI, 3.54-8.05) and 3.36 mmHg (95% CI, 1.93-4.75) after a mean body mass index (BMI) reduction of 2.27 kg/m[2] , and the SBP and DBP were significantly reduced by 6.65 mmHg (95% CI, 5.16-8.14) and 3.63 mmHg (95% CI, 2.03-5.24) after a mean BMI reduction of 4.12 kg/m[2] . The BP reductions were much larger in patients with a BMI decrease â‰¥3 kg/m[2] than in patients with less BMI decrease, both for clinic SBP [8.54 mmHg (95% CI, 4.62-12.47)] versus [3.83 mmHg (95% CI, 1.22-6.45)] and clinic DBP [3.45 mmHg (95% CI, 1.59-5.30)] versus [3.15 mmHg (95% CI, 1.21-5.10)]. The significant reduction of the clinic and ambulatory BP followed the weight loss, and this phenomenon could be more notable after medical intervention and a larger weight loss.",
