  "abstract": "The incidence of childhood cancer has steadily increased since the 1950s, with approximately 16,000 children diagnosed each year. However, with the advent of more effective multimodal therapies, childhood cancer survival rates have continued to improve over the past 40 years, with >80% of patients now surviving into adulthood. Fertility preservation (FP) has become an important quality-of-life issue for many survivors of childhood cancer. As a result, the therapeutic options have become less gonadotoxic over time and more patients are being offered FP options. This review examines the indications for consultation, male and female FP options both in the prepubertal patient and adolescent patient, and the unique ethical issues surrounding FP in this vulnerable population.
