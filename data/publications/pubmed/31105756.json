  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the differences in 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in older patients with hypertension treated with the five major classes of antihypertensive drugs, as monotherapy or dual combination therapy, to improve daytime and nighttime BP control. METHODS: We enrolled 1920 Chinese community-dwelling outpatients aged â‰¥ 60 years and compared ambulatory BP values and ambulatory BP control (24-hour BP < 130/80 mmHg; daytime mean BP < 135/85 mmHg; and nighttime mean BP < 120/70 mmHg), as well as nighttime BP dip patterns for monotherapy and dual combination therapy groups. RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 71 years, and 59.5% of patients were women. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) constituted the most common (60.3% of patients) monotherapy, and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers combined with CCBs was the most common (56.5% of patients) dual combination therapy. Monotherapy with beta-blockers (BB) provided the best daytime BP control. The probabilities of having a nighttime dip pattern and nighttime BP control were higher in patients receiving diuretics compared with CCBs (OR = 0.52, P = 0.05 and OR = 0.41, P = 0.007, respectively). Patients receiving RAS/diuretic combination therapy had a higher probability of having controlled nighttime BP compared with those receiving RAS/CCB (OR = 0.45, P = 0.004). Compared with RAS/diuretic therapy, BB/CCB therapy had a higher probability of achieving daytime BP control (OR = 1.27, P = 0.45). CONCLUSIONS: Antihypertensive monotherapy and dual combination drug therapy provided different ambulatory BP control and nighttime BP dip patterns. BB-based regimens provided lower daytime BP, whereas diuretic-based therapies provided lower nighttime BP, compared with other antihypertensive regimens.",
