  "title": "The predictive value of interarm systolic blood pressure differences in patients with vascular disease: Sub-analysis of the COMPASS trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Systolic blood pressure interarm difference (IAD) predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in primary prevention populations. We examined the predictive value of IAD and the effects of treatment with the combination of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin 100 mg once daily versus aspirin 100 mg once daily according to IAD in patients with chronic coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. METHODS: COMPASS trial patients with IAD <15 mmHg and IAD >15 mmHg were compared with respect to thirty-month incidence risk of: 1) composite of stroke, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death (MACE), 2) composite of acute limb-ischemia or vascular amputation (MALE), 3) composite of MACE or MALE, and 4) effects of treatment with the combination versus aspirin alone on these outcomes. RESULTS: 24,539 patients had IAD<15 mmHg and 2,776 had IAD ≥15 mmHg. Relative to patients with IAD ≥15 mm Hg, those with IAD<15 mmHg had similar incidence rates for all measured outcomes including the composite of MACE or MALE (HR 1.12 [95% CI: 0.95 to 1.31], p = 0.19), with the exception of stroke (HR 1.38 [95% CI: 1.02 to 1.88], p = 0.04). Compared to aspirin alone, the combination consistently reduced the composite of MACE or MALE in both IAD <15 mmHg (HR 0.74 [95% CI: 0.65-0.85], p < 0.0001, ARR = -23.1) and IAD>15 mmHg (HR 0.65 [95% CI: 0.44-0.96], p = 0.03; ARR = -32.6, p interaction = 0.53) groups. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike primary prevention populations, measuring IAD for risk stratification purposes does not appear to be useful in patients with established vascular disease.",
