  "abstract": "Fatigued driving contributes to a substantial number of motor vehicle accidents each year. Music listening is often employed as a countermeasure during driving in order to mitigate the effects of fatigue. Though music listening has been established as a distractor in the sense that it increases cognitive load during driving, it is possible that increased cognitive load is desirable under particular circumstances. For instance, during situations that typically result in cognitive underload, such as driving in a low-traffic monotonous stretch of highway, it may be beneficial for cognitive load to increase, thereby necessitating allocation of greater cognitive resources to the task of driving and attenuating fatigue. In the current study, we employed a song-naming game as a countermeasure to fatigued driving in a simulated monotonous environment. During the first driving session, we established that driving performance deteriorates in the absence of an intervention following 30min of simulated driving. During the second session, we found that a song-naming game employed at the point of fatigue onset was an effective countermeasure, as reflected by simulated driving performance that met or exceeded fresh driving behavior and was significantly better relative to fatigued performance during the first driving session.",
