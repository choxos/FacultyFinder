  "title": "Initial Outcomes of an Online Continuing Education Series Focused on Post-treatment Cancer Survivorship Care.",
  "abstract": "There is a growing number of post-treatment cancer survivors in the USA. Cancer survivors can have a variety of care needs and health care professionals must be prepared to meet these needs. The American Cancer Society (ACS) and the George Washington University (GW) Cancer Center developed The Cancer Survivorship E-Learning Series for Primary Care Providers (E-Learning Series) to address the need for cancer survivorship training and education among health care professionals with a focus on primary care. The GW Cancer Center analyzed evaluation data from 1341 learners who voluntarily completed a module pre- and post-assessment between April 15, 2013, and December 31, 2017, to assess differences in self-rated confidence, on a five-point Likert scale, to meet learning objectives. Descriptive statistics characterize the sample and paired samples t tests were used to assess any statistically significant differences from pre to post (p < 0.05). Most learners were nurses (75.19%) and a majority of learners worked in oncology (74.68%) followed by primary care (11.60%). At pre-assessment, the module with the lowest mean self-confidence rating was 3.16 (SD = 0.81) and the highest was 3.60 (SD = 0.73). At post-assessment, module means in self-confidence rating ranged from 4.08 (SD = 0.46) to 4.26 (SD = 0.56). All differences were statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Results highlight gaps in confidence among health care professionals regarding cancer survivorship care and the need for continuing education. There is also a need for additional uptake of the E-Learning Series among primary care providers. Results suggest that the E-Learning Series is an effective educational tool that increases learners' confidence in providing cancer survivorship care.",
