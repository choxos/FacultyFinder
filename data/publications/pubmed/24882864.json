  "title": "Development of criteria to distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis: a report from the GRAPPA 2013 Annual Meeting.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe a research project to develop simple clinical criteria to aid in the identification of inflammatory arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and spondylitis and distinguish these from non-inflammatory conditions. The criteria are particularly intended to aid non-rheumatologists, e.g., dermatologists, who need assistance identifying psoriatic arthritis in patients with psoriasis, but may be useful to all clinicians in properly diagnosing rheumatologic conditions. METHODS: The proposed research methodology includes the use of a nominal group exercise among expert clinicians and patient focus groups, Delphi exercises among clinicians and patients, application of criteria test sets to a small group of representative patients with inflammatory and non-inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions, and validation by application of optimal criteria sets to large groups of patients with inflammatory and noninflammatory conditions. RESULTS: Examples of elements to describe inflammatory conditions derived from a nominal group exercise conducted at the 2013 GRAPPA annual meeting are described, along with planned project activities. CONCLUSION: This project will lead to the development of practical criteria to aid in the diagnosis and appropriate clinical care of patients with chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal conditions.",
