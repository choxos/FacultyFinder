  "abstract": "Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that mediates a variety of cellular functions. Analogue-sensitive kinase technology was applied to the study of ZIPK signaling in coronary artery smooth muscle cells. ZIPK was engineered in the ATP-binding pocket by substitution of a bulky gatekeeper amino acid (Leu93) with glycine. Cell-permeable derivatives of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine provided effective inhibition of L93G-ZIPK (1NM-PP1, IC50 , 1.0 μM; 3MB-PP1, IC50 , 2.0 μM; and 1NA-PP1, IC50 , 8.6 μM) but only 3MB-PP1 had inhibitory potential (IC50 > 10 μM) toward wild-type ZIPK. Each of the compounds also attenuated Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) activity under experimental conditions found to be optimal for inhibition of L93G-ZIPK. In silico molecular simulations showed effective docking of 1NM-PP1 into ZIPK following mutational enlargement of the ATP-binding pocket. Molecular simulation of 1NM-PP1 docking in the ATP-binding pocket of ROCK was also completed. The 1NM-PP1 inhibitor was selected as the optimal compound for selective chemical genetics in smooth muscle cells since it displayed the highest potency for L93G-ZIPK relative to WT-ZIPK and the weakest off-target effects against other relevant kinases. Finally, the 1NM-PP1 and L93G-ZIPK pairing was effectively applied in vascular smooth muscle cells to manipulate the phosphorylation level of LC20, a previously defined target of ZIPK.",
