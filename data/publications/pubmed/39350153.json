  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The intestinal barrier encompasses physical and immunological components that act to compartmentalize luminal contents, such as bacteria and endotoxins, from the host. It has been proposed that an age-related decline of intestinal barrier function may allow for the passage of luminal contents into the bloodstream, triggering a low-grade systemic inflammation termed inflamm-aging. Although there is mounting evidence to support this hypothesis in model species, it is unclear if this phenomenon occurs in humans. In addition, despite being well-established that biological sex impacts aging physiology, its influence on intestinal barrier function and inflamm-aging has not been explored. RESULTS: In this study, we observed sex differences in markers of intestinal barrier integrity, where females had increased epithelial permeability throughout life as compared to males. With age, females had an age-associated increase in circulating bacterial products and metabolites such as LPS and kynurenine, suggesting reduced barrier function. Females also had age-associated increases in established markers of inflamm-aging, including peripheral blood monocytes as well as TNF and CRP. To determine if impaired barrier function was driving inflamm-aging, we performed a mediation analysis. The results show that the loss of intestinal barrier integrity was not the mediator of inflamm-aging in humans. Instead, persistent, low-grade inflammation with age preceded the increase in circulating bacterial products, which we confirmed using animal models. We found, as in humans, that sex modified age-associated increases in circulating monocytes in mice, and that inflammation mediates the loss of intestinal barrier function. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results suggest that higher basal intestinal permeability in combination with age-associated inflammation, increases circulating LPS in females. Thus, targeting barrier permeability in females may slow the progression of inflamm-aging, but is unlikely to prevent it.",
