  "title": "Gout-induced endothelial impairment: The role of SREBP2 transactivation of YAP.",
  "abstract": "Gout is a multifaceted inflammatory disease involving vascular impairments induced by hyperuricemia. Experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells treated with uric acid (UA), monosodium urate (MSU), or serum from gout patients showed increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes (ie, VCAM1, ICAM1, CYR61, CCNA1, and E2F1) with attendant increase in monocyte adhesion. Mechanistically, UA- or MSU-induced SREBP2 expression and its transcriptional activity. RNA sequencing analysis and real-time PCR showed the induction of YAP signaling and pro-inflammatory pathways in HUVECs transfected with adenovirus-SREBP2. The SREBP2 knockdown by siRNA partially abolished UA- or MSU-induced YAP activity, pro-inflammatory gene expression, and monocytes adhesion. Vascular intima from transgenic mice overexpressing SREBP2 in endothelium or mice with hyperuricemia exhibited activated YAP signaling and increased expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Betulin, an SREBP pharmacological inhibitor, attenuated the UA-, MSU-, or gout serum-induced endothelial cell inflammation and dysfunction. In the human study, endothelial cell function, assessed by EndoPAT, was negatively correlated with serum UA level among gouty patients and healthy controls. Collectively, UA or MSU causes endothelial dysfunction via SREBP2 transactivation of YAP. Betulin inhibition of SREBP2 may restrain gout-induced endothelial dysfunction.",
