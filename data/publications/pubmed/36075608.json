  "title": "[Selection and application of explanatory and pragmatic randomized controlled trials in clinical research of acupuncture].",
  "abstract": "In the view of the controversy that there is no efficacy difference between true and sham acupuncture in acupuncture randomized controlled trials (RCTs), it is analyzed that one of the reasons is that many clinical studies do not properly understand the design of RCT research and interpret the research results. Starting from the concept and coverage of explanatory RCT and pragmatic RCT, this study lists the application examples of two types of RCTs in the field of acupuncture from five aspects: research purpose and trial environment, subject selection, intervention measures, control measures and outcome evaluation, so as to provide some ideas for their application in clinical trials.",
