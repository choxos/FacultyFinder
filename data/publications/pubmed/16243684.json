  "title": "Levelling the playing field? Exploring the implications of managed competition for voluntary sector providers of long-term care in small town Ontario.",
  "abstract": "This paper considers how long-term care restructuring, under the rubric of managed competition, has increased pressure on voluntary sector providers of long-term care to elderly populations in small, rural places. Drawing on in-depth interviews with key-informants from non-profit organizations, we present a case study set in rural Ontario to develop a situated understanding of the impact of restructuring on voluntary sector providers of long-term care. We contend that managed competition (underway in Ontario since 1995) has constrained providers, eroded service choices, and reduced access to long-term care in rural areas leaving rural populations more disadvantaged than ever before when it comes to public service provisioning.",
