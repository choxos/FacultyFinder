  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach is the de facto standard framework for summarising evidence in systematic reviews and developing recommendations in clinical practice guidelines. METHODS: We describe how the GRADE approach is used in clinical practice guidelines, including key points and examples. The intended audience of this overview of GRADE is clinicians and researchers who are, or plan to be, involved in the development or assessment of clinical practice guidelines. RESULTS: We cover guideline endorsement and adaptation; guideline panels and sponsors; conflicts of interest; guideline questions and outcome prioritisation; systematic review creation, updating and re-use; rating the overall certainty of evidence; development of recommendations and implications; and peer review, publication, implementation and updating of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: This overview aims to help developers, assessors and users of clinical practice guidelines understand how trustworthy, high-quality guidelines are developed using the GRADE approach.",
