  "title": "Assessing a safety climate tool adapted to address respiratory illnesses in Canadian hospitals.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have shown an association between workplace safety climate scores and patient outcomes. This study aimed to investigate (1) performance of the hospital safety climate scale that was adapted to assess acute respiratory illness safety climate, (2) factors associated with safety climate scores, and (3) whether the safety scores were associated with following recommended droplet and contact precautions. METHODS: A survey of Canadian healthcare personnel participating in a cohort study of influenza during the 2010/2011-2013/2014 winter seasons. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used for analyses. RESULTS: Of the 1359 participants eligible for inclusion, 88% were female and 52% were nurses. The adapted items loaded to the same factors as the original scale. Personnel working on higher risk wards, nurses, and younger staff rated their hospital's safety climate lower than other staff. Following guidelines for droplet and contact precautions was positively associated with ratings of management support and absence of job hindrances. CONCLUSION: The adapted tool can be used to assess hospital safety climates regarding respiratory pathogens. Management support and the absence of job hindrances are associated with hospital staff's propensity and ability to follow precautions against the transmission of respiratory illnesses.",
