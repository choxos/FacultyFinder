  "title": "Incorporating equity, diversity, and inclusion into the epidemiology and biostatistics curriculum: A workshop report and implementation strategies recommendations.",
  "abstract": "There is an obligation among those teaching epidemiology to incorporate principles of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) into the curriculum. While there is a well-established literature related to teaching epidemiology, this literature rarely addresses critical aspects of EDI. To our knowledge, there is no working group or central point of discussion and learning for incorporating EDI into epidemiology teaching in Canada. To address this gap, we convened a workshop entitled \"Incorporating EDI into the epidemiology and biostatistics curriculum and classroom.\" The workshop discussed nine strategies to incorporate EDI in the epidemiology curriculum: positionality (or reflexivity) statements; opportunities for feedback; land acknowledgements; clarifying the purpose of collecting data on race and ethnicity, sex and gender, Indigeneity; acknowledging that race/ethnicity is a social construct, not a biological variable; describing incidence and prevalence of disease; demonstrating explicit bias using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs); critical appraisal of study population diversity; and admission criteria and considerations. Key take-aways from the workshop were the need to be more intentional when determining the validity of evidence, particularly with respect to historical context and the need to recognize that there is no single solution that will address EDI.",
