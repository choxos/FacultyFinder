  "abstract": "To investigate and comprehend the evolving research hotspots, cutting-edge trends, and frontiers associated with defensive medicine. The original data was collected from the Web of Science core collection and then subjected to a preliminary retrieval process. Following screening, a total of 654 relevant documents met the criteria and underwent subsequent statistical analysis. Software CiteSpace was employed for conducting a customized visual analysis on the number of articles, keywords, research institutions, and authors associated with defensive medicine. The defensive medicine research network was primarily established in Western countries, particularly the United States, and its findings and conceptual framework have significantly influenced defensive medicine research in other regions. Currently, quantitative methods dominated most studies while qualitative surveys remained limited. Defensive medicine research mainly focused on high-risk medical specialties such as surgery and obstetrics. Research on defensive medicine pertained to the core characteristics of its conceptual framework. An in-depth investigation into the factors that give rise to defensive medicine is required, along with the generation of more generalizable research findings to provide valuable insights for improving and intervening in defensive medicine.",
