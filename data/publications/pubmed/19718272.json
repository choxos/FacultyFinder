  "title": "The Development of a Culturally Sensitive Pediatric Pain Management Intervention for African American Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease.",
  "abstract": "This article describes a cognitive-behavioral pain management intervention for adolescents with sickle cell disease with particular emphasis on description of components that enhance its cultural sensitivity. To date, 25 participants have been randomized to the pain management intervention. Treatment expectation ratings at baseline and midpoint (after Session 2) and participant feedback regarding interest in, enjoyment of, and helpfulness of the intervention are presented. Preliminary data indicate that most of the participants have been engaged in and have responded well to the intervention. Challenges of the intervention are discussed.",
