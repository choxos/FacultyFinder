  "title": "The multifaceted roles of extracellular vesicles in osteonecrosis of the femoral head.",
  "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a severe disease characterized by bone tissue necrosis due to vascular impairment, often leading to joint collapse and requiring surgical intervention. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) serve as crucial mediators of intercellular communication, influencing osteogenesis, angiogenesis, and immune regulation. This review summarizes the dual role of EVs in both the pathogenesis of ONFH and post-necrosis bone repair, highlighting the impact of various EV-mediated signaling pathways on bone regeneration and the potential crosstalk among these pathways. Additionally, EVs hold promise as diagnostic biomarkers or contrast agents to complement conventional imaging techniques for ONFH detection. By elucidating the role of EVs in osteonecrosis and addressing the current challenges, we aspire to establish a foundation for the timely identification and treatment of ONFH. The translational potential of this article: This review comprehensively discusses the role of EVs in ONFH, providing innovative and promising insights for its diagnosis and treatment, which also establishes a theoretical foundation for the future clinical application of EVs in ONFH.",
