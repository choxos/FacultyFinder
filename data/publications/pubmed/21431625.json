  "title": "Antiemetic prophylaxis in thyroid surgery: a randomized, double-blind comparison of three 5-HT3 agents.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this double-blind randomized study was to compare the antiemetic efficacy of three 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 antagonists in terms of the incidence and intensity of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a homogenous group of female patients undergoing thyroidectomy. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 203 American Society of Anesthesiologists PS I-II female patients randomized into four groups to receive at induction of anesthesia an intravenous (IV) bolus of 5 ml solution of one of the following: normal saline (placebo), granisetron 3 mg, ondansetron 4 mg, or tropisetron 5 mg. Nausea and vomiting were evaluated at five time points: during the first hour in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and 6, 12, 18, and 24 h postoperatively. Nausea intensity was measured using a visual analogue scale score (0-10). RESULTS: Patients in the placebo group displayed a high incidence of nausea in the PACU and at 6, 12, and 18 h postoperatively (44, 60, 50, and 34%, respectively) and of vomiting (26, 42, 30 and 10%). The administration of granisetron reduced significantly the incidence of nausea at 6, 12, and 18 h (26, 18, and 2%, respectively) and vomiting at 6 and 12 h (10 and 6%, respectively). Ondansetron reduced significantly the incidence of nausea and vomiting only at 6 h postoperatively (28 and 12%, respectively). The administration of tropisetron did not affect the incidence of PONV compared to placebo. CONCLUSION: Among the female patients of this study undergoing thyroid surgery, granisetron 3 mg provided the best prophylaxis from PONV. Ondansetron 4 mg was equally effective, but its action lasted only 6 h, whereas tropisetron 5 mg was found ineffective.",
