  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Laryngeal transplantation offers the potential for patients without a larynx to recover their voice, which is critical in our communication age. We report clinical and functional outcomes from a laryngotracheal transplant. Widespread adoption of this technique has been slowed due to the ethical concerns of life-long immunosuppression after a nonvital organ transplant. Our patient was already on immunosuppressive medication from prior kidney-pancreas transplantation, and therefore was not exposed to added long-term risk. We describe the unique technical advances, clinical course, and rehabilitation of this patient and the implications for future laryngeal transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: A laryngotracheal transplantation was performed in a 51-year-old prior kidney-pancreas transplant recipient presenting with complete laryngotracheal stenosis. Surgical modifications were made in the previously described technique related to retrieval, vascular supply, and reinnervation. This resulted in a robustly vascularized organ with well-perfused long-segment tracheal transplant and early return of motor reinnervation. RESULTS: A multidisciplinary approach resulted in a successful transplant without evidence of rejection to date. Postoperatively, the patient continues to rely on a tracheotomy but has had the return of an oral and nasal airway, vocalization, smell, and taste, all experienced for the first time in 11 years. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that our methods may result in a successful laryngotracheal transplant. We describe the preparation, surgical technique, rehabilitation, and interventions employed in achieving optimal outcomes. This report contributes valuable information on this rarely performed composite transplant.",
