  "title": "Association of Household Utility of Cleaner Fuel With Lower Hypertension Prevalence and Blood Pressure in Chinese Adults.",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To investigate whether lower hypertension prevalence or blood pressure was associated with cleaner household fuel usage for cooking and heating among Chinese adults. Methods: We enrolled 44,862 Chinese adults at the baseline of the prospective urban and rural epidemiology (PURE) study in China during 2005-2009, as a subset of the PURE-global China site. Multilevel logistic regression and generalized linear mixed models were conducted to estimate the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and regression coefficient for hypertension and blood pressure respectively, while subgroup analysis by ambient PM2.5 concentration and location was also examined. Results: Compared with the least clean household solid fuel group, gas (AOR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.99) or electricity (AOR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.87) was associated with significantly lower levels of hypertension prevalence and blood pressure, and a similar pattern of the association was consistently observed among participants with high ambient PM2.5 exposure and those living in urban areas. Conclusion: Household utility of cleaner fuel type was associated with lower hypertension prevalence and blood pressure in Chinese adults. Our study urges the utilization of cleaner household energy to mitigate the burden of hypertension.",
