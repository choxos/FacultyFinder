  "title": "Impact of Non-viral Coinfections on Mortality of Severely Ill COVID-19 Patients in Dubai.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections may have been associated with secondary infection. Community-acquired or hospital-acquired such infections affect clinical outcomes. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the impact of these infections on clinical outcomes. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of all consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Dubai hospital. RESULTS: Patients with secondary non-viral infections (SNIs) have higher mortality than patients without SNIs (57.3% vs. 43.7%, p=0.037). Patients with SNIs had more days on mechanical ventilation (MV) 19(11-27) vs. 5(2-10) p<0.001, more LOSICU 22 (15-33) vs. 7 (2-11) p<0.001, and more length of stay in hospital (LOSH) 28 (18-45) vs. 11.5 (6-19), p<0.001. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that SNIs do not predict mortality. Linear logistic regression analysis showed patients with SNIs have increased length of stay in ICUs (LOSICUs), length of stay in hospitals (LOSHs), and prolonged needs for MV. CONCLUSION: SNIs are high in patients admitted to ICU for COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Although they do not impact mortality, they prolong the need for MV, LOSICU, and LOSH.",
