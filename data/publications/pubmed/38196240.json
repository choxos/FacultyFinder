  "abstract": "Pregnant individuals and parents have experienced elevated mental health problems and stress during COVID-19. Stress during pregnancy can be harmful to the fetus and detrimental to the parent-child relationship. However, social support is known to act as a protective factor, buffering against the adverse effects of stress. The present study examined whether (1) prenatal stress during COVID-19 was associated with parent-infant closeness at 6 months postpartum, and (2) social support moderated the effect of prenatal stress on the parent-infant relationship. In total, 181 participants completed questionnaires during pregnancy and at 6 months postpartum. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was conducted to assess whether social support moderated the effect of stress during pregnancy on parent-infant closeness at 6 months postpartum. Results indicated a significant interaction between prenatal stress and social support on parents' perceptions of closeness with their infants at 6 months postpartum (β = .805, p = .029); parents who experienced high prenatal stress with high social support reported greater parent-infant closeness, compared to those who reported high levels of stress and low social support. Findings underscore the importance of social support in protecting the parent-infant relationship, particularly in times of high stress, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
