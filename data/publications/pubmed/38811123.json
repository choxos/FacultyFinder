  "title": "Evaluation of Outcomes After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: What We Know, What We Have, and What to Consider.",
  "abstract": "Measurement of success following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) hinges on the appropriate use of high quality and meaningful outcome measures. We identified and categorized over 100 outcome measures for ACLR using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model. The ICF model is a useful framework to facilitate decisions about outcome selection and describe recovery following ACL injury. We outline key considerations when selecting outcome measures during study design (purpose, measurement properties, sample size, global assessment) or evaluating reported outcomes (measurement properties, sample size, magnitude/precision, clinical relevance, applicability), and discuss challenges in outcome measurement following ACLR.",
