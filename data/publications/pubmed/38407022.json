  "title": "Quantified Metabolomics and Lipidomics Profiles Reveal Serum Metabolic Alterations and Distinguished Metabolites of Seven Chronic Metabolic Diseases.",
  "abstract": "The co-occurrence of multiple chronic metabolic diseases is highly prevalent, posing a huge health threat. Clarifying the metabolic associations between them, as well as identifying metabolites which allow discrimination between diseases, will provide new biological insights into their co-occurrence. Herein, we utilized targeted serum metabolomics and lipidomics covering over 700 metabolites to characterize metabolic alterations and associations related to seven chronic metabolic diseases (obesity, hypertension, hyperuricemia, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver) from 1626 participants. We identified 454 metabolites were shared among at least two chronic metabolic diseases, accounting for 73.3% of all 619 significant metabolite-disease associations. We found amino acids, lactic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, triacylglycerols (TGs), and diacylglycerols (DGs) showed connectivity across multiple chronic metabolic diseases. Many carnitines were specifically associated with hyperuricemia. The hypercholesterolemia group showed obvious lipid metabolism disorder. Using logistic regression models, we further identified distinguished metabolites of seven chronic metabolic diseases, which exhibited satisfactory area under curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.848 to 1 in discovery and validation sets. Overall, quantitative metabolome and lipidome data sets revealed widespread and interconnected metabolic disorders among seven chronic metabolic diseases. The distinguished metabolites are useful for diagnosing chronic metabolic diseases and provide a reference value for further clinical intervention and management based on metabolomics strategy.",
