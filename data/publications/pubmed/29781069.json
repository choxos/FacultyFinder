  "abstract": "Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has been the cornerstone of antithrombotic management for patients undergoing percu-taneous coronary intervention (PCI). Despite low-quality evidence, triple antithrombotic therapy involving acetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, and warfarin or non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC) has been recommended in patients with concomitant atrial fibrillation undergoing PCI, who require long-term oral anticoagulation, although such a strategy is associated with a substantially increased risk of bleeding compared with DAPT. NOAC combined with P2Y12 inhibitor alone appears to be safer and as effective as triple therapy with warfarin in patients with acute coronary syndromes based on the results of recent randomised trials on dabigatran and rivaroxaban. The present review summarises the current data on various combinations of antithrombotic agents in terms of their efficacy and safety.",
