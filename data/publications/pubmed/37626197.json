  "title": "Toxicity of chromium to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in two soils: influence of soil properties and chromium form.",
  "abstract": "The toxicity of Cr to plants depends on Cr form and soil properties. Currently, the phytotoxicity differences of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) in different soils are not clear. In this study, the toxicity of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) to root growth and root morphology of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were compared in Shandong fluvo-aquic soil (SD soil) and Jiangxi red soil (JX soil) that is differing in soil properties. The toxicity thresholds of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) on wheat root elongation were determined by fitting the dose-effect curves. Results showed that the 10% and 50% root length inhibitory concentrations (EC10 and EC50) of Cr(III) were 53.1 and 125 times of Cr(VI) in SD soil and 8.11 and 1.36 times of Cr(VI) in JX soil, indicating that Cr(VI) was more toxic to wheat roots than Cr(III) in both soils and the toxicity discrepancy of the two forms of Cr was more prominent in SD soil. Cr(VI) exhibited higher toxicity in SD soil (alkaline) than in JX soil (acidic), whereas Cr(III) showed the opposite pattern. In addition, the ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid extractable Cr (EDTA-Cr) concentrations in soils were correlated well with the relative wheat root elongation (R[2]=0.854, P<0.01), indicating that soil EDTA-Cr concentration can be used as a predictor of Cr phytotoxicity. Both Cr(VI) and Cr(III) showed significant biphasic dose effects on wheat root morphology (root length, root surface area, root volume, and root tip number) in JX soil. These findings are helpful for the risk evaluation of Cr contamination in agricultural soils.",
