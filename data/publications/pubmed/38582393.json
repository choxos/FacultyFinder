  "title": "Exploring ncRNA-mediated regulation of EGFR signalling in glioblastoma: From mechanisms to therapeutics.",
  "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and deadly primary brain tumor type, with a discouragingly low survival rate and few effective treatments. An important function of the EGFR signalling pathway in the development of GBM is to affect tumor proliferation, persistence, and treatment resistance. Advances in molecular biology in the last several years have shown how important ncRNAs are for controlling a wide range of biological activities, including cancer progression and development. NcRNAs have become important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, and they may affect the EGFR pathway by either directly targeting EGFR or by modifying important transcription factors and downstream signalling molecules. The EGFR pathway is aberrantly activated in response to the dysregulation of certain ncRNAs, which has been linked to GBM carcinogenesis, treatment resistance, and unfavourable patient outcomes. We review the literature on miRNAs, circRNAs and lncRNAs that are implicated in the regulation of EGFR signalling in GBM, discussing their mechanisms of action, interactions with the signalling pathway, and implications for GBM therapy. Furthermore, we explore the potential of ncRNA-based strategies to overcome resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies, including the use of ncRNA mimics or inhibitors to modulate the activity of key regulators within the pathway.",
