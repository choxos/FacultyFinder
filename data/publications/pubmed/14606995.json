  "title": "An evaluation of rapid point-of-collection oral fluid drug-testing devices.",
  "abstract": "New technology is currently being marketed to rapidly test oral fluids for drugs of abuse at the point of collection (POC). There are no nationally accepted standards or cutoff concentrations for detecting drugs in oral fluids and for most analytes there are significant differences in cutoff concentrations across devices. Four devices were evaluated (OralLab), RapiScan, Drugwipe, and SalivaScreen) for their ability to meet manufacturers claims, and proposed federal standards for criminal justice and workplace programs. Human oral fluid fortified with known quantities of drug [drug(s) or metabolite(s)] was used to test these devices. Overall, the performance of these rapid POC oral fluid drug-testing devices was quite variable. Some devices performed well for the analysis of some drug classes but poorly for others. In general, most devices performed well for the detection of methamphetamine and opiates, but all performed poorly for the detection of cannabinoids. The ability to accurately and reliably detect cocaine and amphetamine was dependent on the individual device.",
