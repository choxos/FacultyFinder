  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In this study, we investigated the prevalence of depression, depression treatment, and symptom burden in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and examined their associations with the center for epidemiologic studies depression scale revised (CESD-R) scores. METHODS: The Prospective Registry in Scleroderma at Massachusetts General Hospital (PRISM) is a longitudinal registry of patients with SSc. Among participants with CESD-R score ≥ 16, indicating possible depression, a chart review was performed for mental health diagnoses and treatments. We examined the relation of demographic and clinical factors to the presence of mental health diagnoses or treatment using logistic regression. We evaluated the association of SSc symptoms and the COVID-19 pandemic with a CESD-R score using quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 214 patients enrolled in PRISM, 129 participants (38% diffuse and 59% limited) completed at least one CESD-R questionnaire. In the first survey, 29% had possible depression (CESD - R ≥ 16) and 16% had probable depression (CESD - R ≥ 23). Of 20 participants with probable depression, 90% received treatment for a mood disorder. In a multivariable logistic regression model among participants with CESD - R ≥ 16, none of the evaluated variables (CESD-R score, age, gender, employment status, race, and ethnicity) was associated with mental health diagnosis or treatment. Higher baseline dyspnea index, modified Rodnan skin score, and the University of California Los Angeles Scleroderma Clinical Trials Consortium Gastrointestinal total score and subscores were associated with higher CESD-R score. CONCLUSION: In this single-center cross-sectional study, 16% of participants had significant depressive symptoms. Dyspnea, extent of skin involvement, and gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with depression symptoms.",
