  "title": "When a Tooth Pulls the Heart Strings: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Post-dental Extraction.",
  "abstract": "Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress-induced cardiomyopathy, is a temporary left ventricular dysfunction caused by a catecholamine surge under severe stress. It's characterized by chest pain, non-specific ECG changes, and left ventricular apical ballooning observed during catheterization. We present a case of a 59-year-old postmenopausal female with a past medical history of asthma who arrived at the ED complaining of chest pain following dental extraction. The patient's abnormal ECG findings and elevated cardiac enzymes required cardiac catheterization, which revealed normal coronary vasculature but demonstrated left ventricular apical ballooning. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showed septal left ventricular hypertrophy, decreased ejection fraction (EF), and akinetic segments consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Secondary takotsubo cardiomyopathy induced by stress in the setting of dental procedures like a tooth extraction for a periapical dental abscess is rarely described in the literature. Our case serves as a reminder of the potential for stress-induced cardiomyopathy in postmenopausal women, especially those with undiagnosed underlying anxiety disorders, even following minimally invasive procedures.",
