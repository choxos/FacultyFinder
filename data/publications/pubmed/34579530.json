  "title": "Transition Metal-Free C-H Thiolation via Sulfonium Salts Using β-Sulfinylesters as the Sulfur Source.",
  "abstract": "We disclose a direct C(sp)-, C(sp[2])-, and C(sp[3])-H thiolation reaction using β-sulfinylesters as the versatile sulfur source. The key step of this protocol is chemoselective C-S bond cleavage of the sulfonium salts that are formed in situ from the corresponding alkenes, alkynes, and 1,3-dicarboxyl compounds with β-sulfinylesters. The successful capture of the acrylate byproduct supports a retro-Michael reaction mechanism.",
