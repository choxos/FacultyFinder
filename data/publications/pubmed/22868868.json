  "title": "EEG source imaging in epilepsy--practicalities and pitfalls.",
  "abstract": "EEG source imaging (ESI) is a model-based imaging technique that integrates temporal and spatial components of EEG to identify the generating source of electrical potentials recorded on the scalp. Recent advances in computer technologies have made the analysis of ESI data less time-consuming, and have rekindled interest in this technique as a clinical diagnostic tool. On the basis of the available body of evidence, ESI seems to be a promising tool for epilepsy evaluation; however, the precise clinical value of ESI in presurgical evaluation of epilepsy and in localization of eloquent cortex remains to be investigated. In this Review, we describe two fundamental issues in ESI; namely, the forward and inverse problems, and their solutions. The clinical application of ESI in surgical planning for patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy, and its use in source reconstruction together with invasive recordings, is also discussed. As ESI can be used to map evoked responses, we discuss the clinical utility of this technique in cortical mapping-an essential process when planning resective surgery for brain regions that are in close proximity to eloquent cortex.",
