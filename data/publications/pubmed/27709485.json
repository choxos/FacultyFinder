  "title": "Pediatric anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Treatment of pediatric anterior cruciate injuries have become an area of controversy sparking much debate about best management strategies. Delaying surgery until skeletal maturity has often been shown to result in unfavorable outcomes due to concomitant meniscal and chondral injuries in this population. There have been numerous techniques used to reconstruct the ACL in the skeletally immature patient; however, most studies are limited by small patient numbers and other methodological concerns. With recent publications reporting failure rates as high as 15-25 % and growth disturbances being uncommon but now reported within almost every technical category, patient and caregiver education become of paramount importance. Key principles will be outlined that may help to avoid some of the pitfalls that occur when dealing with this unique population.",
