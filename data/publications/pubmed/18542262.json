  "abstract": "A versatile mid-infrared hyperspectral imaging system is demonstrated by combining a broadly tunable external cavity quantum cascade laser and a microbolometer focal plane array. The tunable midinfrared laser provided high brightness illumination over a tuning range from 985 cm(-1) to 1075 cm(-1) (9.30-10.15 mum). Hypercubes containing images at 300 wavelengths separated by 0.3 cm(-1) were obtained in 12 s. High spectral resolution chemical imaging of methanol vapor was demonstrated for both static and dynamic systems. The system was also used to image and characterize multiple component liquid and solid samples.",
