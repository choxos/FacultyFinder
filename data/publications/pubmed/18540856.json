  "abstract": "A prognostic study about an orthopaedic implant is an investigation that studies both the short-and long-term success rates of a specific procedure and identifies factors that contribute to the longevity of the implant. This article identifies the steps a surgeon needs to take when critically evaluating literature on the prognosis of an implant they are intending to use. It is not only important to consider whether the study design is scientifically valid, whether the follow-up was long enough to justify accurate survival rates, and whether the estimates of survival were precise, but also whether the results of the study are applicable to the patient being treated by the surgeon.",
