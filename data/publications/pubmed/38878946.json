  "title": "Long-Term Functional Limitations and Predictors of Recovery After COVID-19: A Multicenter Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on post-severe COVID-19 functional trajectory, particularly considering premorbid status. We characterized 1-year functional recovery post-hospitalization for COVID-19, highlighting predictors of long-term recovery. METHODS: We enrolled adult patients with lab-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized for COVID-19 sequelae, from five major Ontario, Canada hospitals in a prospective cohort study. Assessments included telephone interviews on admission followed by telephone and in-person assessments at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-months post-discharge. The Activity-Measure for Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC) Mobility and Cognition scales were administered at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. Secondary outcomes included symptoms, spirometry, physical performance, dyspnea, fatigue, distress, anxiety and depression, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 254 patients (57.1% male) with a mean age of 60.0 (±13.1) years and an average hospital stay of 14.3 (±19.7) days agreed to participate. At 12 months, 55.3% demonstrated clinically important deficits in mobility and 38.8% had cognitive deficits compared to premorbid levels. Fatigue was reported in 44.2%, followed by difficulty walking long distances in 35.8% and dyspnea in 33.0%. Almost 40% of patients had an FEV1(% Pred) < 80% at 12 months, 60.3% had impairments in physical performance, and 44.5% had problems with anxiety or depression. Predictors of better mobility at 12 months included higher premorbid mobility status, male sex, shorter hospital stay, fewer comorbidities, and higher FEV1 (% pred) at the 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides compelling evidence of the long-term impact of COVID-19 on functional and cognitive status 1-year post-infection.",
