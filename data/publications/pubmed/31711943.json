  "title": "Assessment of functional ability of nonambulatory patients with obesity: after and before bariatric surgery.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Functional ability is often impaired as a direct consequence of severe obesity. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for severe obesity. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of weight loss after bariatric surgery on patients with impaired functional ambulatory abilities due to obesity. SETTINGS: A high-volume university-affiliated bariatric surgery center in India. METHOD: We conducted a prospective study in a cohort of nonambulatory patients with functional disabilities (bedridden, wheelchair-bound, or walker-dependent) who underwent bariatric surgery. Data on sex, body mass index, co-morbid conditions, the severity of pain, and types of limitations in functional abilities were collected at baseline and at 1 year after bariatric surgery and analyzed. RESULTS: Forty-five patients were enrolled in this study with 100% follow-up at 1 year. The mean age and body mass index of the patients were 54.7 ± 8.5 years and 54.2 ± 8.6 kg/m[2], respectively. Thirty-four (75.5%) were female, 27 (60%) were walker-dependent, 14 (31.1%) were wheelchair-bound, and 4 (8.9%) were bedridden. At baseline 88.8% and 75.5% patients had severe knee and back pain, respectively. The percentage of total weight loss was 22% and 31% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. At 1 year, 37 (82.2%) patients were ambulating independently, only 1 (2.2%) patient was still bedridden, and 7 (15.5%) patients were walker-dependent. Mild, moderate, and severe classification on all functional ability scales were significantly improved. CONCLUSION: Weight loss after bariatric surgery results in significant amelioration of knee and/or back pain with an improvement in functional abilities and quality of life.",
