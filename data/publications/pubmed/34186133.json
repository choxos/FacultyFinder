  "title": "Does a Positive Surgical Margin After Nephron Sparing Surgery Affect Oncological Outcome in Renal Cell Carcinoma? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "We systematically evaluated the impact of positive surgical margins (PSM) on oncological outcomes after partial nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. Forty-two studies comprising 101,153 subjects were included and five distinct meta-analyses were performed. PSM was associated with increased risk of local recurrence (hazard ratio (HR) 6.11-high certainty), metastasis (HR 3.29-moderate certainty), overall relapse (HR 2.25-high certainty), overall mortality (HR 1.30-moderate certainty), and may be associated with increased cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.91-low certainty). Patients with PSM should be counseled for the possibility of additional surgery, novel adjuvant therapies, and more rigorous surveillance.",
