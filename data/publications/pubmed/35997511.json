  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Changes to income and employment are key social determinants of health that have impacted many families during the COVID-19 pandemic. This research aimed to understand how changes to employment and income influenced family environments that contribute to early childhood development and health. METHODS: A concurrent triangulation mixed method design was used through a cross-sectional survey on early impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic involving families with young children in the Canadian Maritime provinces (n = 2158). Analyses included multivariate regression models to examine whether changes to employment and income predicted changes to Family access to resources and social support, parenting Abilities and self-care at home, and home Routines and Environments (FARE Change Scale). Content analysis was used to identify themes from the open-ended questions. RESULTS: Changes to employment and income early in the pandemic like no longer working but continued to receive salary, working fewer hours for the same salary earned before the pandemic, no longer working nor receiving salary, working fewer hours resulting in salary reduction, essential worker status and household income were significant predictors of FARE Change Scale when ethnicity/cultural background and province of residence are controlled (P < .05). Themes provided a description of family impacts, including shifting employment and income, finding time and capacity, feelings of guilt and the creation of new routines. CONCLUSION: Our study provides insight on the implications of public health restrictions, such as the importance of increased time for parents (through reduced work hours) and access to resources and social support to support child development and health.",
