  "title": "Measuring Outcomes in Cosmetic Abdominoplasty: The BODY-Q.",
  "abstract": "The BODY-Q is a condition-specific patient-reported outcome measure that enables a comprehensive assessment of outcomes that are specific to patients undergoing body contouring procedures such as abdominoplasty. The BODY-Q scales were designed to be responsive to the effects of abdominoplasty on health-related quality of life and appearance outcomes. The BODY-Q covers a range of content domains, and the independently functioning scales enable surgeons to tailor the BODY-Q to their needs. The application of the BODY-Q in cosmetic clinics internationally may give rise to better understanding of abdominoplasty outcomes and optimize the care delivered to patients undergoing these procedures.",
