  "title": "Understanding the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on infant/child health: multiethnic considerations, knowledge translation, and future directions for equitable health research.",
  "abstract": "A mother's intrauterine environment influences her health and that of her offspring, at birth and in the future. Herein, we present an overview of our Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)-funded grant \"Understanding the impact of maternal and infant nutrition on infant/child health\"-set within The NutriGen Birth Cohort Alliance. NutriGen is a consortium of four Canadian prospective birth cohorts representing >5000 mother-child pairs of diverse ethnic groups including South Asians, White Europeans, and Indigenous peoples. We summarize our objectives and main findings on outcomes of maternal diet, gestational diabetes, birth weight, cardiometabolic health, the microbiome, and epigenetic modifications. We append this work with 10 key messages when conducting multiethnic research and review our knowledge translation products. We describe the clinical impact of our research on maternal and child health and conclude with future directions on biomarker discovery, expansion to other ethnic groups, and interventions for high-risk populations.",
