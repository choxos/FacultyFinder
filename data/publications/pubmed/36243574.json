  "title": "Short- and Long-Term Outcomes for Ethnic Minorities in the United States After Liver Transplantation: Parsing the Hispanic Paradox.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionally affected by end-stage liver disease. Unfortunately, disparities in referrals to liver transplantation (LT), organ allocation, and posttransplant outcomes exist in this population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients over the age of 18 years undergoing LT in the United States using the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients from 2002 to 2016. We evaluated factors associated with patient and graft outcomes and explored the effect of race and ethnicity along with social variables. RESULTS: During the study time period, 78,999 patients received LT. Of these, 60,102 were non-Hispanic White (NHW), 7988 were African American (AA), and 10,909 were Hispanic. AA had significantly lower patient survival, graft survival, and death-censored graft survival at both 1 and 5 years when compared to NHW. Conversely, at 1 and 5 years, patient survival and graft survival were significantly higher for Hispanics compared to NWH. In addition, AA had significantly lower survival outcomes compared to Hispanics. On multivariate analysis after controlling for race/ethnicity, age, AA race, diagnosis, and deceased donor were independent risk factors for patient death and graft failure. CONCLUSIONS: Despite socioeconomic disadvantages seen among Hispanics, this population appears to have improved short- and long-term survival after LT compared to NHW and AA.",
