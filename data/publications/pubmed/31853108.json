  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine between premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to evaluate its relationship with time since onset of menopause. METHODS: The cross-sectional comparative study was conducted at Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from April 2017 to March 2018, and comprised individuals recruited from the Gynaecology and Obstetrics outpatient department of the Pakistan Railway Hospital in the city. The subjects were divided into two groups; pre-menopausal women in Group I and postmenopausal in Group II. Group II was subdivided into three categories according to time since onset of menopause. Serum asymmetric dimethylarginine levels were estimated in each subject. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 80 subjects, there were 40(50%) in Group I with a mean age of 36.25}6.8 years, 40(50%) in Group II with a mean age of49.83}4.35 years. There was a significant increase in mean asymmetric dimethylarginine levels in Group II compared to Group I (p<0.05). There was also a significant increase in asymmetric dimethylarginine levels with increase in duration since the onset of menopause (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine increased significantly after menopause.",
