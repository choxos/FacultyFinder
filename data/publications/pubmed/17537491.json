  "title": "UCN-01 in combination with topotecan in patients with advanced recurrent ovarian cancer: a study of the Princess Margaret Hospital Phase II consortium.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: UCN-01 is a staurosporine analogue shown to abrogate the G2 checkpoint through inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases. Preclinical evidence suggests synergy between UCN-01 and cytotoxic chemotherapy. Topotecan is an active agent in ovarian cancer. This phase II study was conducted to investigate the safety and efficacy of topotecan and UCN-01 in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. METHODS: A two-stage phase II trial was designed for patients with advanced ovarian cancer with progressive disease despite prior treatment with platinum and paclitaxel. Patients with advanced ovarian cancer were treated with topotecan, 1 mg/m(2) IV, days 1 to 5, and UCN-01 70 mg/m(2) on day 1 of the first cycle, and 35 mg/m(2) on day 1 of all subsequent cycles. Treatment was repeated on a 3-week cycle. The primary objective of this study was objective response rate while secondary objectives included rates of stable disease, duration of response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as toxicity. Tumor biopsy specimens were also collected where possible for molecular correlative studies. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients are evaluable for toxicity and efficacy. Three patients (10%) achieved a partial response. The median time to progression was 3.3 months (95% CI 1.5-NA), and the median overall survival was 9.7 months (95% CI: 7.5-15.3). The most common grade 3-4 toxicities were neutropenia (79%), anemia (41%), thrombocytopenia (14%), hyperglycemia (10%), and pain (10%). CONCLUSION: The combination of UCN-01 and topotecan is generally well tolerated, however, this combination is not considered to have significant antitumor activity against advanced ovarian cancer.",
