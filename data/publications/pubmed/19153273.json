  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery is a major health issue. Lacking effective therapies, risk factor modification may offer a means of preventing this complication. The objective of the present study was to identify and determine the prognostic importance of such risk factors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Data from a multicenter cohort of 3500 adult patients who underwent cardiac surgery at 7 hospitals during 2004 were analyzed (using multivariable logistic regression modeling) to determine the independent relationships between 3 thresholds of AKI (>25%, >50%, and >75% decrease in estimated glomerular filtration rate within 1 week of surgery or need for postoperative dialysis) with death rates, as well as to identify modifiable risk factors for AKI. The 3 thresholds of AKI occurred in 24% (n=829), 7% (n=228), and 3% (n=119) of the cohort, respectively. All 3 thresholds were independently associated with a >4-fold increase in the odds of death and could be predicted with several perioperative variables, including preoperative intra-aortic balloon pump use, urgent surgery, and prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass. In particular, 3 potentially modifiable variables were also independently and strongly associated with AKI. These were preoperative anemia, perioperative red blood cell transfusions, and surgical reexploration. CONCLUSIONS: AKI after cardiac surgery is highly prevalent and prognostically important. Therapies aimed at mitigating preoperative anemia, perioperative red blood cell transfusions, and surgical reexploration may offer protection against this complication.",
