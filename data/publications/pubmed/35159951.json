  "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) occurs when two alleles of mutated hemoglobin (HbS or HbC) are inherited (HbSS and HbSC) rather than one (HbAS or HbAC), which indicates a person carries the sickle cell trait. The high prevalence of these two alleles in Africa have been associated with reduced malaria susceptibility. Recent in vitro research has been shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-451a and let-7i-5p are differentially expressed in HbSS erythrocytes compared to healthy controls (HbAA) and are overexpressed in Plasmodium-infected malaria erythrocytes. However, these miRNAs have not been fully examined in the plasma of people with different sickle hemoglobin genotypes. Plasma circulating miRNAs are commonly encapsulated in extracellular vesicles, such as exosomes, and are thought to play a role in disease development. Circulating exosomal miR-451a and let-7i-5p were quantified from individuals with various hemoglobin genotypes (HbAA, HbAS, HbAC, HbSS, HbSC, and HbCC) with (+) and without (-) malaria. The results showed a higher level of exosomal let-7i-5p and miR-451a in HbSS-. Exosomal let-7i-5p and miR-451a levels were lower in HbSS+ compared to other genotypes. Based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROCs), both exosomal miRNAs may be useful disease biomarkers for SCD with malaria. Finally, miR-451a and let-7i-5p modulate genes involved in inflammation, making them potential biomarkers of pathogenesis for both diseases.",
