  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: CD36 is involved in oxidant stress, hyperlipidemia, and thrombosis in the pathology of stroke. CD 36 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were reported to be associated with abnormalities of serum FA, triglyceride level and to increase risk of metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. Based on these finding we hypothesized that CD36 is an important candidate gene of stroke; therefore, we set out a case-control study to explore the association of CD36 SNPs with ischemic stroke. METHODS: We enrolled 374 patients with atherothrombotic stroke as cases and 1,013 people without stroke as controls. CD36 rs3211842, rs3211870, rs1761667, rs9784998, and rs10499859 loci were detected by PCR-ligase detection reaction. RESULTS: Only rs1761667 (P=0.042) and rs10499859 (P=0.038) polymorphisms were associated with cases of ischemic stroke. Under a dominant genetic model, logistic regression analysis revealed a 1.34-fold increased risk (95% CI 1.05-1.72) of ischemic stroke with rs1761667 A than non-A carriers (P=0.020); the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was 1.38 (95% CI 1.06-1.78) after adjusting for the covariates age, gender, body mass index (BMI), cigarette smoking, hypertension, and diabetes. For rs10499859, the risk was increased 1.36-fold for G than non-G carriers (P=0.016), and the AOR was 1.39 (95% CI 1.08-1.81) (P=0.012). The 5 SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium. CD36 SNPs may have no association with plasma lipid levels and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) expression. CONCLUSION: CD36 rs1761667 and rs10499859 may indicate genetic susceptibility to ischemic stroke among Chinese Han.",
