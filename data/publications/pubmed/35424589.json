  "title": "Effective utilization of magnetic nano-coupled cloned β-xylanase in saccharification process.",
  "abstract": "The β-xylanase gene (DCE06_04615) with 1041 bp cloned from Thermotoga naphthophila was expressed into E. coli BL21 DE3. The cloned β-xylanase was covalently bound to iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles coated with silica utilizing carbodiimide. The size of the immobilized MNPs (50 nm) and their binding with β-xylanase were characterized by Fourier-transform electron microscopy (FTIR) (a change in shift particularly from C-O to C-N) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (spherical in shape and 50 nm in diameter). The results showed that enzyme activity (4.5 ± 0.23 U per mL), thermo-stability (90 °C after 4 hours, residual activity of enzyme calculated as 29.89% ± 0.72), pH stability (91% ± 1.91 at pH 7), metal ion stability (57% ± 1.08 increase with Ca[2+]), reusability (13 times) and storage stability (96 days storage at 4 °C) of the immobilized β-xylanase was effective and superior. The immobilized β-xylanase exhibited maximal enzyme activity at pH 7 and 90 °C. Repeated enzyme assay and saccharification of pretreated rice straw showed that the MNP-enzyme complex exhibited 56% ± 0.76 and 11% ± 0.56 residual activity after 8 times and 13 times repeated usage. The MNP-enzyme complex showed 17.32% and 15.52% saccharification percentage after 1[st] and 8[th] time usage respectively. Immobilized β-xylanase exhibited 96% residual activity on 96 days' storage at 4 °C that showed excellent stability.",
