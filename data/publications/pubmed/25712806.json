  "title": "Feasibility of Transseptal Puncture Using a Nonfluoroscopic Catheter Tracking System.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radiation exposure in the electrophysiology lab is a major occupational hazard to the electrophysiologists. A catheter localization system (MediGuide Technology, St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) allows the integration of electroanatomical mapping and x-ray imaging, and has been shown to be effective in reducing radiation exposure during several electrophysiological procedures. We intended to evaluate the feasibility of this catheter tracking system to guide transseptal (TS) access. METHODS: The feasibility of performing TS puncture with MediGuide (MDG) was assessed in a prospective observational study in 16 patients undergoing radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation. These patients were compared to 16 matched patients undergoing similar procedures during the same time frame using conventional approach. There were no differences in mean age, gender distribution, and body mass index between the two groups. Total duration of fluoroscopic exposure during TS puncture was compared between the two groups. RESULTS: All patients underwent successful TS puncture. Fluoroscopy time for double TS puncture using the MDG system was significantly lower than the control group (0.48 ± 0.17 minutes vs. 5.9 ± 0.65 minutes; P < 0.0001). No major complications occurred during the procedures in either group. CONCLUSIONS: TS puncture can be successfully performed using MDG, and results in significant reduction in radiation exposure.",
