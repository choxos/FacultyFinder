  "title": "A Scoping Review of Evidence-Based Interventions for Adolescents with Depression and Suicide Related Behaviors in Low and Middle Income Countries.",
  "abstract": "Depression is the number one cause of disability for adolescents. Moreover, depression is the strongest predictor for suicide, which is the second cause for death among adolescents worldwide. A total of 22 RCTs conducted in 14 different LMICs have been reviewed. This is a significant effort to provide mental health services for adolescents in LMICs. However, considering that 2/3 of the world's countries meet criteria for LMIC status and 75% of suicides occur in LMICs, more research addressing both understanding and intervention/prevention of depression and suicide must be conducted in these countries.",
