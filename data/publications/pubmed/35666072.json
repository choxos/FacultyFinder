  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess stakeholder ratings of health indicators and subgroup analyses in systematic reviews used to update the Canadian Clinical Practice Guideline for Managing Paediatric Obesity. METHODS: Stakeholders (caregivers of children with obesity and Clinical Practice Guideline Steering Committee members) completed an online survey between April 2020 and March 2021. Participants rated importance of health indicators and subgroup analyses for behavioural and psychological, pharmacotherapeutic, and surgical interventions for managing paediatric obesity from not important to critically important using Grading, Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. RESULTS: No health indicators or subgroup analyses were rated not important by the 30 caregivers and 17 Steering Committee members. Across intervention types, stakeholders rated anxiety, depression, health-related quality of life, serious adverse events, plus age and weight status subgroups as critically important. CONCLUSION: Stakeholder ratings will inform data reporting and interpretation to update Canada's Clinical Practice Guideline for Managing Paediatric Obesity.",
