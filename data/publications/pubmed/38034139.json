  "title": "Partially Reversible Bilateral Papilledema in a Patient Using Anastrozole: A Case Study.",
  "abstract": "Anastrozole is an endocrine-modifying agent used in the treatment of estrogen-sensitive breast cancer in the postmenopausal breast cancer population. Anastrozole is known for its side effect profile which includes an increased risk of osteoporosis. However, emerging evidence in the literature in the form of case studies demonstrates several potential ocular side effects due to the use of the medication. In our study, a 66-year-old female using anastrozole suffered severe bilateral papilledema that resolved after cessation of the medication. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the use of anastrozole and its impact on ocular health leading to deleterious side effects, such as papilledema.",
