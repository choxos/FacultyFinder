  "title": "Multiomics Based Association Mapping in Wheat Reveals Genetic Architecture of Quality and Allergenic Related Proteins.",
  "abstract": "Wheat is an important staple crop since its proteins contribute to human and animal nutrition and are important for its end-use quality. However, wheat proteins can also cause adverse human reactions for a large number of people. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) on 114 proteins quantified by LC-MS-based proteomics and expressed in an environmentally stable manner in 148 wheat cultivars with a heritability > 0.6. For 54 proteins, we detected quantitative trait loci (QTL) that exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold and explained 17.3âˆ’84.5% of the genotypic variance. Proteins in the same family often clustered at a very close chromosomal position or the potential homeolog. Major QTLs were found for four well-known glutenin and gliadin subunits, and the QTL segregation pattern in the protein encoding the high molecular weight glutenin subunit Dx5 could be confirmed by SDS gel-electrophoresis. For nine potential allergenic proteins, large QTLs could be identified, and their measured allele frequencies open the possibility to select for low protein abundance by markers as long as their relevance for human health has been conclusively demonstrated. A potential allergen was introduced in the beginning of 1980s that may be linked to the cluster of resistance genes introgressed on chromosome 2AS from Triticum ventricosum. The reported sequence information for the 54 major QTLs can be used to design efficient markers for future wheat breeding.",
