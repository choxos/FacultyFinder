  "title": "Gut microbiota as the critical correlation of polycystic ovary syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
  "abstract": "Gut microbiota forms a symbiotic relationship with the host and maintains the ecological balance of the internal and external environment of the human body. However, dysbiosis of the gut microbiota and immune deficiency, as well as environmental changes, can destroy the host-microbial balance, leading to the occurrence of a variety of diseases, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity. Meanwhile, diseases can also affect gut microbiota, forming a vicious cycle. The role of the intestinal microbiota in different diseases have been proven by several studies; however, as a common target of PCOS and T2DM, there are few reports on the treatment of different diseases through the regulation of intestinal microbiota as the critical correlation. This review analyzed the common mechanisms of intestinal microbiota in PCOS and T2DM, including the dysbiosis of gut microbiota, endotoxemia, short-chain fatty acids, biotransformation of bile acids, and synthesis of amino acid in regulating insulin resistance, obesity, chronic inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The possible therapeutic effects of probiotics and/or prebiotics, fecal microbiota transplantation, bariatric surgery, dietary intervention, drug treatment, and other treatments targeted at regulating intestinal microbiota were also elucidated.",
