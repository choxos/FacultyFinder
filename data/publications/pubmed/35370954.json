  "title": "The Long-Term Effects of Non-Pharmacological Interventions on Diabetes and Chronic Complication Outcomes in Patients With Hyperglycemia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at examining the long-term effects of non-pharmacological interventions on reducing the diabetes incidence among patients with prediabetes and chronic complications events among patients with hyperglycemia (pre-diabetes and diabetes) by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science Core Collection were searched for studies published between January 1990 and November 2021, looking for RCTs to evaluate the effects of non-pharmacological interventions on preventing the incidence of diabetes and chronic complications in comparison with medical therapy, placebo, or usual diabetes care. Two independent reviews extracted relevant data and quality assessment. Any discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. RESULTS: In total, 20 articles involved 16 RCTs (follow-up ranged from 2 to 30 years) were included. Pooled analysis of intervention studies demonstrated clearly that non-pharmacological interventions have a significant effect on reducing the diabetes events in patients with prediabetes (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.54, 0.71). Pooled analysis of extended follow-up studies showed that non-pharmacological interventions could effectively reduce the diabetes incidence in patients with prediabetes (RR 0.78; 95% CI 0.63, 0.96). Meta-regression and subgroup analysis indicates that the diabetes incidence of the long-term group (duration > 3 years) was clearly reduced by 0.05% compared with the relatively short-term group (duration â‰¤ 3 years). The incidence of microvascular complications in patients with hyperglycemia was effectively lowered by non-pharmacological interventions (RR 0.60; 95% CI 0.43, 0.83). CONCLUSION: Non-pharmacological interventions have a long-term effect on reducing the diabetes incidence among prediabetic patients and effectively preventing microvascular complications on hyperglycemia.
