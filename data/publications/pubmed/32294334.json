  "abstract": "Limited information is available about the performance of bioabsorbable-polymer drug-eluting stents in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. Patients treated with these stents presenting with acute myocardial infarction are at higher risk of adverse events compared with stable patients. Further clinical trials are needed to fully understand the role of bioabsorbable-polymer drug-eluting stents in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction.",
