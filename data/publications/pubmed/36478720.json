  "title": "Assessment of risk, landscape epidemiology and management strategies to combat alveolar echinococcosis in the rural communities of Hunza, Pakistan.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Human alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is a neglected zoonotic disease. Prevalence of AE in humans is reported in Pakistan as a result of poor economic and sanitary conditions, close proximity to wildlife and limited knowledge of AE. Studies on the prevalence and transmission of AE have been limited, especially for rural Pakistan. The study objectives were to identify knowledge, attitudes and practices relating to AE, to determine awareness of the disease, and to identify knowledge about possible risk factors of infections involving the landscape epidemiological attributes of rural villages in Hunza, one of the districts of Gilgit-Baltistan, a region of Pakistan that borders China. METHODS: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among the general population of Hunza to establish the level of awareness, knowledge, attitudes, practices, landscape epidemiology, and disease management and control relating to AE in rural areas of Hunza. Data were collected by questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 387 questionnaires was received. Statistical analysis showed that the population's knowledge about the disease was poor. The attitudes and practices of the participants indicated that their risk of infection was low. Knowledge of landscape epidemiology of the disease was poor but knowledge about AE disease management was good. The attitudes of residents toward disease treatment and control strategies were positive, although the overall knowledge of participants about prevention of infection was poor. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of AE is poor among the residents of Hunza, Pakistan. Our study demands continued and strengthened awareness of the changes to lifestyle and practices associated with AE, not only in the study locality but throughout other areas of Pakistan.",
