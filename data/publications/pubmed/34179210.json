  "title": "Arthroscopy Association of Canada Position Statement on Exercise for Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review of Guidelines.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Exercise is widely regarded to improve pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) through building supportive muscle mass, facilitating weight loss, and through the other beneficial effects associated with it. PURPOSE: To explore literature that presents clinical guidelines for the use of exercise in the treatment of knee OA to inform an evidence-based position statement for the Arthroscopy Association of Canada. STUDY DESIGN: Position statement. METHODS: PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were searched for guidelines commenting on the role of exercise for knee OA. The search was limited to guidelines published in the last 10 years. Articles were screened for relevance, focusing on recently published research with clinical guidelines. Inclusion criteria involved all articles providing clinical guidelines for exercise and knee OA. RESULTS: Eight guidelines were identified. All eight recommended exercise as an important component of treatment for knee OA, with 6/8 strongly recommending it. CONCLUSION: Exercise is an effective and important component of the non-pharmacological management of knee OA. The Arthroscopy Association of Canada strongly recommends the use of exercise in the management of knee OA.",
