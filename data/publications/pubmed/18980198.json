  "title": "Characterization of interfacial chemistry of adhesive/dentin bond using FTIR chemical imaging with univariate and multivariate data processing.",
  "abstract": "Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) chemical imaging can be used to investigate molecular chemical features of the adhesive/dentin interfaces. However, the information is not straightforward and is not easily extracted. The objective of this study was to use multivariate analysis methods, principal component analysis, and fuzzy c-means clustering and to analyze spectral data in comparison with univariate analysis. The spectral imaging data collected from both the adhesive/healthy dentin and adhesive/caries-affected dentin specimens were used and compared. The univariate statistical methods such as mapping of intensities of specific functional group do not always accurately identify functional group locations and concentrations because of more or less band overlapping in adhesive and dentin. Apart from the ease with which information can be extracted, multivariate methods highlight subtle and often important changes in the spectra that are difficult to observe using univariate methods. The results showed that the multivariate methods gave more satisfactory, interpretable results than univariate methods and were conclusive in showing that they can discriminate and classify differences between healthy dentin and caries-affected dentin within the interfacial regions. It is demonstrated that the multivariate FTIR imaging approaches can be used in the rapid characterization of heterogeneous, complex structure.",
