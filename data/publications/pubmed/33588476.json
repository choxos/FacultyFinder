  "title": "[Association between management factors and herd status regarding Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus infection - An analysis in the course of a voluntary PRRSV control program in Saxony and Thuringia].",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In Saxony and Thuringia, federal states of Germany with a low density of commercial pig farms, a voluntary program aims at controlling porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection. This targets the eradication of the infection on a herd level which has previously been achieved in a subset of herds. The presented study aimed at identifying management factors related with a positive or a negative PRRSV antibody (AB status) or PRRSV genome status (PCR status) on a herd level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data were collected in 82 farms in a region implementing a voluntary PRRSV control program. The test findings for the years 2011 to 2018 were compiled for each year and associated with the interrogated parameters. A generalized linear mixed model was used to identify factors associated with the AB and PCR status. RESULTS: The variables \"separation of contaminated and non-contaminated areas on the loading ramp\" (p = 0.012), \"separation of gilts and sows\" (p = 0.017) and \"recording of visitors in a book\" (p = 0.046) were negatively associated with the PCR status. In contrast, \"separation of gilts and finishers\" (p = 0.044) as well as the existence of \"separated alleyways\" (p = 0.042) were positively related to the PCR status. \"Vaccination against PRRSV\" was positively associated with the AB status and the PCR status (p = 0.005 and p = 0.001, respectively). In numerous variables, a low variability was observed. CONCLUSION: Certain biosecurity measures to control the movement of animals (separation of contaminated and not contaminated areas on the loading ramp) or people (recording of visitors) contribute to a successful reduction of PRRSV infections and a negative herd status. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A combination of different measures may reduce PRRSV spread within pig herds. Breaking the infection cycle in gilts, either by separation of gilts from older sows or immunization, may be considered as a key aspect, presumably additionally supported by keeping gilts together with fattening pigs.",
