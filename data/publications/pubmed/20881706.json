  "title": "The reliability and acceptability of the Multiple Mini-Interview as a selection instrument for postgraduate admissions.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Multiple Mini-Interview (MMI) is useful in selecting undergraduate medical trainees. Postgraduate applicant pools have smaller numbers of more homogeneous candidates that must be actively recruited while being assessed. This paper reports on the MMI's use in assessing residency candidates. METHOD: Canadian and international medical graduates to three residency programs--obstetrics-gynecology and pediatrics (McMaster University) and internal medicine (University of Alberta)--underwent the MMI for residency selection (n = 484) in 2008 and 2009. Reliability was determined and candidates and interviewers completed an exit survey assessing acceptability. RESULTS: Overall reliability of the MMI was acceptable, ranging from 0.55 to 0.72. Using 10 stations would increase reliability to 0.64-0.79. Eighty-eight percent of candidates believed they could accurately portray themselves, while 90% of interviewers believed they could reasonably judge candidates' abilities. CONCLUSIONS: The MMI provides a reliable way to assess residency candidates that is acceptable to both candidates and assessors across a variety of programs.",
