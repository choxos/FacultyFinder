  "title": "Effectiveness of a Self-Administered Computerized Mental Health Screening Tool in the Emergency Department.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine the effectiveness of a self-administered computerized mental health screening tool in a general acute care emergency department (ED). METHODS: Changes in patient care (diagnosis of a past-year psychiatric disorder, request for psychiatric consultation, psychiatric referral at discharge, or transfer to psychiatric facility) and patient ED return visits (3 months after discharge vs. 3 months before) were assessed among ED physicians (N=451) who received patients' computerized screening reports (N=207) and those who did not (N=244). All patients received copies of screening results. RESULTS: The computerized mental health screening tool identified previously undiagnosed psychiatric problems. However, no statistically significant differences were found in physician care or patient ED return visits. CONCLUSIONS: Computerized mental health screening did not result in further psychiatric diagnoses or treatment; it also did not significantly reduce patient ED return visits. Collaboration among EDs and mental health treatment agencies, organizations, and researchers is needed to facilitate appropriate treatment referrals and linkage.",
