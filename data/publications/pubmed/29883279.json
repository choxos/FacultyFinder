  "title": "The effectiveness of consultation for clinicians learning to deliver motivational interviewing with fidelity.",
  "abstract": "Despite the emerging literature documenting gains in clinician competence following consultation, little empirical work has examined consultation as an implementation strategy. To this end, the present study examined consultation in the context of implementing motivational interviewing in four community child and youth mental health organizations. We used qualitative methods with a dual goal: to describe the consultation process and to explore trainees' perspectives on consultation. Participants included 22 clinicians and 9 supervisors who received monthly, group, phone-based consultation for seven months following training in motivational interviewing. Analyses showed that consultation was perceived as effective because it helped to \"keep motivational interviewing alive,\" fulfilled a profound learning function through collaboration and connection with others, and served as protected time for reflection on practice change. Our findings contribute to a body of knowledge about consultation elements that appear to be effective when implementing research-supported interventions in child and youth mental health.",
