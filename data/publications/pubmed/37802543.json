  "title": "Trustworthy evidence-based versus untrustworthy guidelines: detecting the difference.",
  "abstract": "Guidelines are essential tools in healthcare decision-making. Trustworthy guidelines inform clinicians not only on the direction (against or in favour) and strength (strong or weak/conditional) of recommendations but also on the certainty of the underlying evidence. Developing trustworthy guidelines requires panellists with clinical and methodological expertise who consider patients' values and preferences. Adherence to trustworthiness standards remains variable; clinicians should, therefore, be able to distinguish trustworthy from untrustworthy guidelines. In this paper, we offer eight domains of disparities between trustworthy evidence-based guidelines and less trustworthy guidelines.",
