  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that lncRNAs, widely transcribed from genomes, play pivotal regulatory roles in a variety of biological processes, but their function in regulating spermatogenesis in human males is rarely reported. METHODS: QRT-PCR was adopted to detect HOTTIP expression level in testicular tissues from hypospermatogenesis (Hypo) patients or controls. The proliferation levels of NT2 and 293T were measured via CCK-8 and EdU detection. Meanwhile, luciferase reporter gene assay and bioinformatics analysis were carried out to identify a target of HOTTIP. Additionally, the underlying mechanism of HOTTIP's function was investigated using western blotting and RIP analysis. RESULTS: The research results manifested that the expression of HOTTIP in testicular tissues from Hypo patients was prominently reduced in comparison with that in control testicular tissues. Interestingly, it was noted that HOTTIP exhibited a high expression in testicular embryonal carcinoma cell line NT2 compared with that in normal control cell line 293T. It was denoted in cell function evaluation that cell proliferation was impeded by downregulated HOTTIP but evidently stimulated by overexpressed HOTTIP. Moreover, HOTTIP was capable of positively modulating HOXA13 expression via the competitive binding to miR-128-3p. CONCLUSION: Therefore, HOTTIP acting as ceRNAs to promote testicular embryonal carcinoma cell proliferation.",
