  "title": "Partnering with Patients to Enhance Access to Kidney Transplantation and Living Kidney Donation.",
  "abstract": "Kidney transplantation gives many patients with kidney failure a longer and healthier life. Unfortunately, some transplant-eligible patients will never receive one. In this paper, we describe how patients and researchers collaborated on new strategies and programs to enhance access to kidney transplantation and living kidney donation. These efforts led to the creation of the Transplant Ambassador Program (TAP). TAP is a patient-led program that helps connect patients who have kidney failure to individuals who have successfully received a kidney transplant or donated a kidney. We also detail barriers, facilitators and lessons learned from engaging patients in research.",
