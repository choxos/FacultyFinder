  "abstract": "Mesenchymal hamartoma of the chest wall is a rare benign tumor that usually occurs in infants and children. The clinical presentations and imaging features are atypical and difficult to differentiate from malignant tumors. In this article, we present a case with a large mesenchymal hamartoma tumor of the chest wall. A large right-sided chest wall mass was discovered in a 6-month-old boy by his mother. Chest X-ray revealed a thoracic mass with well-defined margins on the right side that expanded into the right ribs. Chest computed tomography showed that the mass originated from the thoracic wall. The patient underwent complete removal of the mass, and histopathology results confirmed a mesenchymal hamartoma.",
