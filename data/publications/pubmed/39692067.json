  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Humanitarian settings are underserved by HIV self-testing (HIV-ST). METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of HIV-ST (Arm 1), HIV-ST alongside edutainment comics (Arm 2), and edutainment comics (Arm 3), compared with the standard of care (SOC), in increasing HIV testing with refugee youth aged 16-24 in the Bidi Bidi Refugee Settlement, Uganda. Intervention effects on HIV testing at 3-month follow-up (T2) were assessed using generalized estimating equation models alongside open-ended questions. RESULTS: Retention was 98% (n = 117/120) at T2. In adjusted analyses compared with the SOC, HIV testing changes from baseline to T2 were highest in Arm 2 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 8.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.87-24.97), followed by Arm 3 (aOR: 4.14; 95% CI: 1.58-10.87), with no significant differences in Arm 1. CONCLUSION: HIV self-testing is feasible for refugee youth in Uganda and can be supplemented with edutainment comics to advance HIV prevention efforts.",
