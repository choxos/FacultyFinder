  "title": "Derivation and Validation of an Electronic Health Record Penicillin Allergy De-Labeling Prevalence Measure.",
  "abstract": "With no standard method to capture penicillin allergy de-labeling prevalence across populations, we developed and validated a simple penicillin allergy de-labeling prevalence measure from electronic health records that achieved perfect sensitivity (100.0%), high specificity (99.4%), and strong agreement with a comprehensive algorithm that included free-text manual review (kappa = .997).",
