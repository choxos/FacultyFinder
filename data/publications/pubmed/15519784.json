  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The Intergroup 0099 trial (INT 0099) for locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) has set a standard of practice. This retrospective review documents our institutional experience with this regimen. METHODS AND MATERIALS: For all NPC patients treated between January 1998 and December 2002 with the INT 0099 regimen, compliance, toxicity, weight change, and feeding tube use were recorded. Patients were grouped by therapy completion status and by feeding tube status. RESULTS: Of 78 consecutive patients, 75 were evaluable. Compliance with radiotherapy was excellent. Only 43% and 61% of patients received all cycles of concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy, respectively. Patients who successfully completed therapy had a higher average baseline weight and were more likely to have had a prophylactic feeding tube. Forty of 75 patients had a feeding tube inserted and were analyzed as two groups. Patients with prophylactic insertion (n = 23) had a more gradual drop in weight, and recovered to a greater degree at 1 year (93.6% vs. 87.2%), than those with a feeding tube inserted therapeutically during treatment (n = 17). CONCLUSIONS: The INT 0099 regimen was generally delivered with modifications to the chemotherapy component, as in the original trial. The prophylactic insertion of a feeding tube may facilitate therapy completion and weight recovery in some patients.",
