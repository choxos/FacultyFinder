  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Self-management interventions for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer are needed. The present study reports on the acceptability and feasibility of delivering survivorship care plans (SCPs) and an accompanying app to AYA. PROCEDURE: AYA (n = 224) ages 15-29 who completed treatment for cancer were randomized and received a digital SCP only or an SCP plus a mobile app intended to enhance self-management. For 16 weeks, the app delivered one to two daily messages complementing information in their SCP and tailored based on age, treatment, and health goal. Data are presented on feasibility, self-reported acceptability (including satisfaction and perceived benefits) and its relationship to app engagement (for those in app group), and feedback from qualitative interviews conducted with 10 AYA. RESULTS: The SCP and app proved feasible as evidenced by high recruitment and retention, access to technology, time analysis, moderate app engagement, and minimal technical issues. However, 12% reported never reading the SCP and 8% never used the app. The app and SCP were acceptable to AYA, and SCP acceptability ratings did not differ between groups. For those with the app, acceptability was positively related to message engagement. AYA recommended enhanced individualization and design features of the SCP and app. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of tailored SCPs and mobile health interventions for most AYA, as well as the need for further refinement and research. Delivery of SCPs and digital interventions are acceptable and feasible to AYA survivors, and may help promote health-related knowledge and survivorship self-management.",
