  "title": "Nephele: a cloud platform for simplified, standardized and reproducible microbiome data analysis.",
  "abstract": "MOTIVATION: Widespread interest in the study of the microbiome has resulted in data proliferation and the development of powerful computational tools. However, many scientific researchers lack the time, training, or infrastructure to work with large datasets or to install and use command line tools. RESULTS: The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has created Nephele, a cloud-based microbiome data analysis platform with standardized pipelines and a simple web interface for transforming raw data into biological insights. Nephele integrates common microbiome analysis tools as well as valuable reference datasets like the healthy human subjects cohort of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP). Nephele is built on the Amazon Web Services cloud, which provides centralized and automated storage and compute capacity, thereby reducing the burden on researchers and their institutions. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: https://nephele.niaid.nih.gov and https://github.com/niaid/Nephele. CONTACT: darrell.hurt@nih.gov.",
