  "title": "Histone H3K36I mutation in a metastatic histiocytic tumor of the skull and response to sarcoma chemotherapy.",
  "abstract": "Recurrent somatic missense mutations in histone H3 genes have been identified in subsets of pediatric cancers. H3K36 histone mutations have recently been recognized as oncogenic drivers in rare subsets of malignant soft tissue sarcomas but have not been reported in histiocytic neoplasms. Currently, the histological and molecular spectrum, as well as the clinical behavior of H3K36-mutant soft tissue malignancies, is largely unknown. We describe a pediatric patient with a HIST1H3B K36I-mutant histiocytic tumor arising in the skull. After the failure of upfront therapy for histiocytosis and development of widely disseminated metastatic disease, the patient had an exceptional response to empiric chemotherapy and remains in complete disease remission for more than 5 years. Our report expands the histological spectrum of H3K36M/I-mutant soft tissue malignancies to histiocytic neoplasms and indicates that multiagent sarcoma-like chemotherapy can be highly effective even in the setting of widely disseminated metastatic disease.",
