  "title": "Comparison of Dabigatran Plus a P2Y12 Inhibitor With Warfarin-Based Triple Therapy Across Body Mass Index in RE-DUAL PCI.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Body mass index (BMI) affects drug levels of nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. We sought to assess whether BMI affected outcomes in the RE-DUAL PCI trial. METHODS: RE-DUAL PCI (NCT02164864) evaluated the safety and efficacy of a dual-antithrombotic-therapy regimen using dabigatran (110 mg or 150 mg twice daily and a P2Y12 platelet antagonist) in comparison with triple therapy of warfarin, aspirin, and a P2Y12 platelet inhibitor in 2725 patients with atrial fibrillation who had undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We compared the risk of first International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)-defined major or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding events (primary endpoint) and the composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic embolism, or unplanned revascularization (main efficacy endpoint) in relation to baseline BMI. RESULTS: Median (range) BMI was 28.1 (14-66) kg/m[2]. Dabigatran dual therapy versus warfarin triple therapy had relevantly and similarly lower rates of bleeding at both 110 mg and 150 mg twice-daily doses, irrespective of BMI. Thromboembolic event rates appeared consistent across categories of BMI, including those <25 and ≥35 kg/m[2] (P for interaction: 0.806 and 0.279, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in bleeding with dabigatran dual therapy compared with warfarin triple therapy in patients here evaluated appears consistent across BMI categories.",
