  "abstract": "The existing literature examining the correlates of depression in individuals with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by inconsistent results. The aim of the current study was to replicate and extend the literature by exploring whether various clinical and demographic factors are related to the occurrence of depression in a large sample (N = 243) of individuals with OCD (M age = 33.00; SD = 12.47; 74% female). Individuals with OCD who had elevated comorbid depressive symptoms [Patient Health Questionnaire-9 item (PHQ-9) ≥10] scored significantly higher on all OCD symptom subtypes (p range < .001-.048), had greater obsessive and compulsive severity (ps < .001), scored higher on perfectionism (p < .001), and had higher disgust sensitivity and propensity scores (ps < .001) compared with individuals who did not have comorbid depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 < 10). Of these variables, obsession severity (β = 0.22, p = .004), OCD contamination subtype (β = 0.16, p = .032) and perfectionism (β = 0.25, p < .001) were found to be associated with depressive symptoms on the PHQ-9. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of factors which are associated with depression comorbidity in individuals with OCD.",
