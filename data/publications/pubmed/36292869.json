  "title": "Biotic Potential Induced by Different Host Plants in the Fall Armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).",
  "abstract": "Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a polyphagous insect pest of many important crops. To evaluate the influence of host plants on the biology and survival of the Pakistani population of S. frugiperda, we examined life table parameters of S. frugiperda raised on maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice. The development rate was significantly higher on the maize crop than on the other three host plants. Different larval diets affected development time and fecundity. S. frugiperda attained the fastest larval development (16 days) on maize and the slowest development (32.74 days) on rice. Adult females from maize-fed larvae laid 1088 eggs/female, those from sorghum-fed larvae laid 591.6 eggs/female, those from wheat-fed larvae laid 435.6 eggs/female, and those from rice-fed larvae laid 49.6 eggs/female. Age stage-specific parameters also indicated the higher fecundity, higher life expectancy, and higher survival of S. frugiperda on maize plants than on the other three hosts. Larval diets had a significant varying effect on the finite and intrinsic increase rates, reflecting that maize was the most suitable diet. The findings of the present study are useful for predicting population dynamics especially in areas cultivating Poaceae crops, except maize, to develop sustainable integrated pest management strategies for this pest.",
