  "title": "Physiological and biochemical responses of two spring wheat genotypes to non-hydraulic root-to-shoot signalling of partial and full root-zone drought stress.",
  "abstract": "Non-hydraulic root-sourced signal (nHRS) is so far affirmed to be a unique positive early-warning response to drying soil, however its physiological and agronomic implications are still unclear. We designed two contrast methods to induce nHRS in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes released in different decades under pot-culture conditions. Partial root-zone stress (PS) was performed using the method of split-root alternative water supply (one half wetting and the other drying) to induce the continuous operation of nHRS, and full root-zone stress (FS) was subjected to whole root system to periodic operation of nHRS. nHRS-mediated signalling increased abscisic acid (ABA) production and triggered ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which, thereby, led to up-regulation of antioxidant defense system. Cytokinin synthesis reduced during drought stress while proline and malodialdehyde (MDA) content were increased. Regardless of drought treatment methods and wheat genotype, a significant decrease in grain yield, root biomass and above-ground biomass (p < 0.05) was observed, without significant changes in root-to-shoot ratio. Harvest index was increased, proposing that more energy was allocated to reproductive organs during the action of nHRS. Moreover, higher water use efficiency was witnessed in PS. The data suggest that nHRS triggered ABA accumulation, thereby closing stomata, and reducing water use and also decreases the production of ROS and improves the antioxidant defence enzymes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. This survey of different-decade genotypes suggests that advances in grain yield and drought tolerance would be made by targeted selection for a wheat genetic resource.",
