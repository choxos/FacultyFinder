  "title": "Overcoming barriers in eating disorder care: advances, gaps, and recommendations for equitable assessment and treatment.",
  "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of topics discussed by clinicians and researchers invited to speak at the Canadian Nutrition Society's Thematic Conference 2023, which was centered on advances in research and practice in the assessment and treatment of disordered eating and eating disorders. Presenters emphasized the importance of understanding how systemic factors such as racism, weight stigma, and COVID-19 affect the assessment and treatment of eating disorders, and proposed strategies for addressing these inequities. In this paper, we provide actionable recommendations for clinicians working with individuals with eating disorders; professional development, cultural competence, and equitable assessment and treatment practices are discussed.",
