  "title": "Phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase target subunit by integrin-linked kinase.",
  "abstract": "A mechanism proposed for regulation of myosin phosphatase (MP) activity is phosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase target subunit (MYPT1). Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is associated with the contractile machinery and can phosphorylate myosin at the myosin light-chain kinase sites. The possibility that ILK may also phosphorylate and regulate MP was investigated. ILK was associated with the MP holoenzyme, shown by Western blots and in-gel kinase assays. MYPT1 was phosphorylated by ILK and phosphorylation sites in the N- and C-terminal fragments of MYPT1 were detected. From sequence analyses, three sites were identified: a primary site at Thr(709), and two other sites at Thr(695) and Thr(495). One of the sites for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was Ser(694). Assays with the catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase indicated that only the C-terminal fragment of MYPT1 phosphorylated by zipper-interacting protein kinase, and ILK inhibited activity. The phosphorylated N-terminal fragment activated phosphatase activity and phosphorylation by PKA was without effect. Using full-length MYPT1 constructs phosphorylated by various kinases it was shown that Rho kinase gave marked inhibition; ILK produced an intermediate level of inhibition, which was considerably reduced for the Thr(695)-->Ala mutant; and PKA had no effect. In summary, phosphorylation of the various sites indicated that Thr(695) was the major inhibitory site, Thr(709) had only a slight inhibitory effect and Ser(694) had no effect. The findings that ILK phosphorylated both MYPT1 and myosin and the association of ILK with MP suggest that ILK may influence cytoskeletal structure or function.",
