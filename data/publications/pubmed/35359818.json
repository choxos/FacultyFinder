  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS), although commonly used in clinical practice, is not currently included in training programs for respiratory therapists (RTs). In fact, given its ubiquity and clinical utility, RTs in Ontario, Canada, are changing their mandate to incorporate POCUS into their daily patient assessment. Therefore, we conducted a scoping review of the literature, aiming to describe the current evidence of POCUS training and methods of curriculum delivery for RTs to inform an evidence-based program design. METHOD: We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science from inception to 8 July 2020. We included all studies reporting on RT training in POCUS. Documents included English language, full-text reports of all study designs. Title and abstract screening, full-text review, and data abstraction were done independently and in duplicate. RESULTS: Seven studies met our inclusion criteria, including four full texts and three abstracts; all were prospective and single-center studies, except one multicenter study. Reports were from nine different countries. Studies described cardiac, lung, and procedural ultrasonography use. The majority used a combination of educational methods; didactic talks, hands-on sessions, and practical assessments being the most common methods. There was a median of 11 participants enrolled in a training session. The instructors were physicians from various specialties such as critical care, pulmonology, and radiology. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review identified seven papers that explored different methods of a POCUS curriculum delivery for RTs. From the interventions outlined, teaching POCUS skills to RTs seems feasible. However, further work needs to be done to solidify a POCUS curriculum specific to RTs and examine the impact on patient-related outcomes.",
