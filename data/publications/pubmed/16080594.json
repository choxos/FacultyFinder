  "title": "Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and adult height.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: A cross-sectional survey was performed to evaluate the association between H. pylori and adult height. METHODS: H. pylori infection was assessed using a 13C-urea breath test and height measured by a research nurse using a stadiometer in participants between the ages of 40-49 years. RESULTS: Height was measured in 2932/3682 participants that attended and were evaluable. H. pylori infected women were 1.4 cm shorter than uninfected women (95% confidence interval, CI = 0.7-2.1 cm) and this statistically significant difference persisted after adjusting for age, ethnicity, childhood and present socio-economic status (H. pylori positives 0.79 cm shorter; 95%CI: 0.05-1.52 cm). H. pylori positive men were 0.7 cm shorter than uninfected men but this did not reach statistical significance (95% CI: -0.1-1.5 cm). CONCLUSION: Although H. pylori infection is associated with reduced adult height in women, this maybe due to residual confounding.",
