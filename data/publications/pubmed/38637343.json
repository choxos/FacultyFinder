  "title": "Impact of childhood nephrotic syndrome on obesity and growth: a prospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with nephrotic syndrome are at risk of obesity and growth impairment from repeated steroid treatment. However, incidence and risk factors for obesity and short stature remain uncertain, which is a barrier to preventative care. Our aim was to determine risk, timing, and predictors of obesity and short stature among children with nephrotic syndrome. METHODS: We evaluated obesity and longitudinal growth among children (1-18 years) enrolled in Insight into Nephrotic Syndrome: Investigating Genes, Health, and Therapeutics. We included children with nephrotic syndrome diagnosed between 1996-2019 from the Greater Toronto Area, Canada, excluding congenital or secondary nephrotic syndrome. Primary outcomes were obesity (body mass index Z-score ≥  + 2) and short stature (height Z-score ≤ -2). We evaluated prevalence of obesity and short stature at enrolment (< 1-year from diagnosis) and incidence during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models determined the association between nephrotic syndrome classification and new-onset obesity and short stature. RESULTS: We included 531 children with nephrotic syndrome (30% frequently relapsing by 1-year). At enrolment, obesity prevalence was 23.5%, 51.8% were overweight, and 4.9% had short stature. Cumulative incidence of new-onset obesity and short stature over median 4.1-year follow-up was 17.7% and 3.3% respectively. Children with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent nephrotic syndrome within 1-year of diagnosis were at increased risk of new-onset short stature (unadjusted hazard ratio 3.99, 95%CI 1.26-12.62) but not obesity (adjusted hazard ratio 1.56, 95%CI 0.95-2.56). Children with ≥ 7 and ≥ 15 total relapses were more likely to develop obesity and short stature, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is common among children with nephrotic syndrome early after diagnosis. Although short stature was uncommon overall, children with frequently relapsing or steroid dependent disease are at increased risk of developing short stature. Effective relapse prevention may reduce steroid toxicity and the risk of developing obesity or short stature.",
