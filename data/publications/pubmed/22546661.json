  "title": "Candida tropicalis infection in a term neonate with gall bladder masses and infective endocarditis.",
  "abstract": "Candida endocarditis is extremely rare in term neonates, and gall bladder involvement due to candidemia has never been reported amongst neonates and infants. A term, appropriate for gestational age neonate developed Candida tropicalis blood stream infection in second week of life. He was started on conventional amphotericin B. However, he failed to show any clinical improvement, and candidemia keep on persisting. Repeat sanctuary sites screening revealed multiple echogenic masses in heart (vegetations) and gall bladder. On changing the treatment to liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole, he recovered clinically, echogenic masses in gall bladder disappeared, and intracardiac vegetations decreased in size.",
