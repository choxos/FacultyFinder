  "title": "Mobilization patterns of patients after an acute myocardial infarction: a pilot study.",
  "abstract": "This study was aimed to identify the mobilization patterns of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients during their first three days in the coronary care unit (CCU) by performing a prospective observational pilot study design. The study included 31 diagnosed AMI patients admitted to three CCUs. Mobilization patterns classified as bed rest, semi-fowler, transfer to chair, and standing/walking were documented by CCU nurses for 72 consecutive hours after patient admission to the CCU. Of 2,232 possible mobilization periods (72 hr × 31 patients), 1,385 recorded observations of mobilization (62%) were obtained. Bed rest and semi-fowler positions were the most common mobilization patterns; together they accounted for 70% of the documented positions over the first 72 hr in the CCU. Patients who experience an uncomplicated AMI spend the majority of their first 72 hr in CCU in bed.",
