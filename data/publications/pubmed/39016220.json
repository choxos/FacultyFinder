  "title": "A multi-institutional feasibility lead-in trial of lymphatic mapping with SPECT-CT for evaluating contralateral disease in lateralized oropharynx cancer using 99m-technetium sulfur colloid.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphatic mapping with SPECT-CT has been demonstrated to accurately define lymphatic drainage patterns in oropharyngeal cancer but there has yet to be a study demonstrating its feasibility across multiple institutions. METHODS: Twelve adult patients with lateralized oropharyngeal carcinoma (T1-T3) who were planned for definitive or adjuvant radiotherapy without contralateral nodal disease underwent injection of 99-m technetium sulfur colloid followed by static planar lymphoscintigraphy to verify tracer migration, and SPECT-CT acquired at 30 ± 15 min (optional) and 3 h (±1 h) (mandatory time-point). RESULTS: All 12 patients completed the study with 7/12 patients having the injections performed under local anesthetic and 5 patients requiring general anesthetic. There were no tracer migration failures and there were no serious adverse events or complications encountered. Four out of 12 patients (33%) showed contralateral drainage patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Lymphatic mapping with SPECT-CT of lateralized oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma can be performed safely across multiple institutions.",
