  "abstract": "AIMS: Psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety, after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are rife. Such disorders can make important impacts on patients. We aimed to evaluate the value of the surgical approach, associated with other medical therapies in decreasing depression and anxiety in a group of patients scheduled for CABG in our center. METHODS: In a prospective study, all patients scheduled for CABG in a 6-month period were selected consecutively to enter a two-stage study. The patients were interviewed using Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Rating Scales before and 4 weeks after the operations. RESULTS: Mean age of men in the anxiety group (68 patients) was significantly lower than that of women. Mean anxiety scores before and after the operations were 8.9 ± 4.7 and 6.7 ± 4.4, respectively (P = 0.026). Mean age of women in the depression group (55 patients) was more than that of men (P = 0.04). Mean scores of depression before and after the operations were 13.30 ± 7.59 and 11.2 ± 7.19, respectively (P = 0.027). Men's scores of anxiety and depression were decreased significantly more than those in women after operations. CONCLUSION: CABG surgery can decrease the level of anxiety and depression in patients scheduled for surgery in a short-term follow-up. This effect is more prominent in men than women.",
