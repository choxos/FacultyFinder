  "title": "Feasibility and acceptability of a pilot tailored text messaging intervention for adolescents and young adults completing cancer treatment.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite cure, adolescents and young adults (AYA) who complete cancer treatment remain at risk for numerous physical and psychological late effects. However, engagement in recommended follow-up care, knowledge of cancer treatment history and risks, and adoption of health promoting behaviors are often suboptimal. The pilot randomized controlled trial assessed the feasibility and acceptability of a text messaging intervention (THRIVE; Texting Health Resources to Inform, motiVate, and Engage) designed to promote well-being, and health knowledge and behaviors. METHODS: Sixty-one AYA who recently completed cancer therapy enrolled and were randomized to receive THRIVE (n = 31) or an AYA survivor handbook (n = 30). Participants from both groups completed baseline measures and follow-up surveys 16 weeks later. AYA randomized to THRIVE received one to two health-related text messages per day over 16 weeks. RESULTS: THRIVE demonstrated a high level of acceptability and feasibility. Exploratory analyses highlighted promising improvements in knowledge, fruit/vegetable intake, and perceptions of health vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging is an acceptable and feasible intervention approach for improving well-being and health of AYA survivors. Future research is needed to test the impact of text messaging in a larger trial, including whether or not such an intervention can improve clinical outcomes, such as survivors' engagement in follow-up care.",
