  "title": "A case of necrotizing fasciitis with a LRINEC score of zero: clinical suspicion should trump scoring systems.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a potentially lethal infection involving the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia. The Laboratory Risk Indicator for Necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score has been proposed as a way of using abnormal laboratory values to distinguish between severe cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis. OBJECTIVES: The utility of the LRINEC system, including a review of current literature on this scoring system, is discussed. CASE REPORT: A case of a 37-year-old man is presented. As part of the diagnostic work-up, appropriate laboratory tests necessary to calculate a LRINEC score were obtained. Despite a LRINEC score of 0, NF was later confirmed at surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Although the LRINEC score has been proposed as a robust way of identifying patients with early NF, it failed to detect NF in the patient reported here. NF should thus remain primarily a disease of clinical suspicion, and this suspicion should trump the LRINEC score.",
