  "title": "Incidence and Risk Factors of Chronic Postoperative Pain in Same-day Surgery: A Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The amount of same-day surgery has increased markedly worldwide in recent decades, but there remains limited evidence on chronic postsurgical pain in this setting. METHODS: This study assessed pain 90 days after ambulatory surgery in an international, multicenter prospective cohort study of patients at least 45 yr old with comorbidities or at least 65 yr old. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. Chronic postsurgical pain was defined as a change of more than 1 point in self-rated average pain at the surgical site between baseline and 90 days, and moderate to severe chronic postsurgical pain was defined as a score greater than 4 in self-rated average pain at the surgical site at 90 days. Risk factors for chronic postsurgical pain were identified using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Between November 2021 and January 2023, a total of 2,054 participants were included, and chronic postsurgical pain occurred in 12% of participants, of whom 93.1% had new chronic pain at the surgical site (i.e., participants without pain before surgery). Moderate to severe chronic postsurgical pain occurred in 9% of overall participants. Factors associated with chronic postsurgical pain were active smoking (odds ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.76), orthopedic surgery (odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.24 to 9.7), plastic surgery (odds ratio, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.97 to 9.2), breast surgery (odds ratio, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.29 to 5.8), vascular surgery (odds ratio, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.09 to 6.7), and ethnicity (i.e., for Hispanic/Latino ethnicity, odds ratio, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.68 to 6.9 and for First Nations/native persons, odds ratio, 4.0; 95% CI, 1.05 to 15.4). CONCLUSIONS: Persistent postsurgical pain after same-day surgery is common, is usually moderate to severe in nature, and occurs mostly in patients without chronic pain before surgery.",
