  "abstract": "Femoroacetabular impingement has been established as an impactful cause of hip pain and dysfunction in the young active individual. Improving evidence from well-conducted studies will continue to refine indications and outcomes and perhaps lead to more questions, such as: \"How was the capsule managed?\" \"What was the patient compliance rate with rehabilitation?\" \"What was the impact of surgical morphology correction on clinical outcome?\" \"Did cartilage status impact clinical outcome?\" and \"Was there a noticeable learning curve reflected in outcomes?\" These are all important questions that should be addressed in future studies.",
