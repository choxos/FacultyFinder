  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Brain metastases of pediatric germ cell tumors are uncommon, and there is limited information regarding their incidence, clinical presentation, response to treatment, and influence on survival. METHODS: The authors reviewed the experience with brain metastases from pediatric germ cell tumors at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) over a 40-year period. RESULTS: Between March 1962 and February 2002, 16 of 206 patients with germ cell tumors (7.8%) had brain metastases at the time of initial presentation (n = 2), later in the course of the illness (n = 12), or at autopsy (n = 2). Twelve of 16 patients (75%) had symptoms referable to the brain (nausea/emesis, headaches, or seizures), and 14 (88%) had pulmonary metastases at the time brain metastases were identified. Patients with brain metastases were more likely to have an extragonadal primary tumor (P = 0.013), advanced-stage disease at initial presentation (P = 0.016), and choriocarcinoma within the primary tumor (P < 0.001). The incidence of brain metastases was significantly lower in the second 2 decades of the study period (5 of 135 patients [3.7%]) than in the first 2 decades (11 of 71 patients [15.5%]; P = 0.005). Two of the 16 patients in the current study are long-term survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Brain metastases are uncommon in childhood germ cell tumors, and their incidence appears to be decreasing. In the current study, most patients with such metastases were symptomatic and had pulmonary metastases at the time brain metastases were identified. Patients with the highest risk of developing brain metastases include those with extragonadal tumors, those with high disease stage at initial presentation, and those with choriocarcinoma as a component of the primary tumor. The probability of survival is poor, although a small proportion of patients may become long-term survivors.",
