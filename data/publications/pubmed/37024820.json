  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate potential impact factors associated with corneal biomechanical properties in Chinese myopia and further to investigate quantifying corneal biomechanics in clinical work. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-five eyes from 181 healthy myopic subjects with a mean age of 25.1 ± 9.4 were recruited in this study. Each patient carried out a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including corneal hysteresis(CH), corneal resistance factor(CRF), central corneal thickness(CCT), axial length(AL), intraocular pressure(IOP), spherical equivalence(SE) and corneal curvature (K). CH and CRF were measured with the ocular response analyzer(ORA). To analyze the corneal biomechanical characteristics of myopia patients and their association with other parameters. RESULT: The multiple linear regression analysis showed that CH was positively associated with CCT, and corneal curvature (all with P < 0.05) and negatively associated with SE and AL)(all with P < 0.05); CRF was positively correlated with CCT, corneal curvature and IOP(all with P < 0.05), but negatively correlated with SE and AL(all with P < 0.05). The CH and CRF values in children group were both higher than adults group (≥ 18 years old) (P < 0.05), but it attributed to that the CCT of children was thicker than adults. Excluding factor of CCT, there was no significant difference in CH and CRF between children group and adult group. Excluding factor of CCT, there was no significant difference in CH and CRF among different stage of age (age 18-48). CONCLUSION: The CCT played the most important role of affecting the CH and CRF. The SE, corneal curvature, AL and IOP had a certain influence on corneal biomechanics. Whether the CH and CRF values of individual patient are normal in clinical work, it should refer to the CH and CRF values corresponding CCT sectional range and SE.",
