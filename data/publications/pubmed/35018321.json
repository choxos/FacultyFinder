  "title": "Building and Advancing Coalition Capacity to Promote Health Equity: Insights from the Health Equity Collective's Approach to Addressing Social Determinants of Health.",
  "abstract": "This article presents the structure and function of the Health Equity Collective in developing a systemic approach to promoting health equity across the Greater Houston area. Grounded in Kania and Kramer's five phases of collective impact for coalition building, The Collective operationalizes its mission through its backbone team, steering committees, and eight workgroups; each has goals that mutually reinforce and advance its vision. To date, Phase I (generating ideas), Phase II (initiating action), and Phase III (organizing for impact) have been completed. Phases IV (implementation) and Phase V (sustainability) are currently underway.",
