  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Evidence-based decision-making and practice recommendations are commonly based on findings from quantitative studies or reviews. In the present study, we provide an overview of how to incorporate findings from qualitative research into the evidence-based decision-making process. METHODS: To illustrate how qualitative evidence can be integrated into the decision-making process, we have outlined a clinical nutrition scenario and the process for sourcing credible evidence to inform decision-making. A qualitative health research study was selected and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skill Programme (CASP) appraisal tool for qualitative research. Based on the results of the critical appraisal, the study quality is considered, and we discuss whether the qualitative evidence can be applied to practice. RESULTS: A detailed description of how the qualitative findings can be used conceptually and instrumentally in practice to address the clinical nutrition scenario is provided. CONCLUSIONS: Developing skills in critically appraising findings from qualitative studies will increase awareness and utilisation of this type of evidence in practice and policy, with a goal to ensure that patient/client perceptions are considered, leading to enhanced person-centred care or systems.",
