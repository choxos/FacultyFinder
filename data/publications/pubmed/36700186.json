  "title": "Use of Sacubitril/Valsartan Prior to Primary Prevention Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator Implantation.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) are an adjunct to guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. The uptake of sacubitril/valsartan in this population is not well described. We report the uptake and factors associated with sacubitril/valsartan use in patients with left ventricular dysfunction undergoing ICD implantation. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with left ventricular dysfunction who underwent de novo primary prevention ICD implantation between October 2015 and December 2021 (n = 422) at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Pre-procedure sacubitril/valsartan use was determined. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors associated with sacubitril/valsartan use. A Bayesian estimator of abrupt change was employed to determine a time period in which a change in the rate of sacubitril/valsartan use occurred. RESULTS: Loop diuretic use (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20) and higher severity of New York Heart Association class symptoms (OR = 1.62) were associated with sacubitril/valsartan use. Sacubitril/valsartan use increased during the study period, to 59% in December 2021. This increase was larger among those aged ≥ 65 years (OR = 1.09). A change in the rate of sacubitril/valsartan use occurred 3 years after drug approval, 1 year after provincial drug coverage became available, and 6 months after being strongly recommended in clinical guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary cohort of ICD patients, sacubitril/valsartan use increased between 2015 and 2021, notably in those aged ≥ 65 years and after government drug coverage became available. Understanding barriers to sacubitril/valsartan use in ICD patients is recommended to improve clinical outcomes and survival in this population.",
