  "abstract": "Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) have higher rates of obesity compared to children with typical motor development, and, as a result may be at increased risk for developing metabolic syndrome (MetS). The purpose of this study was to determine the presence of MetS and its components among children with and without DCD. This nested case-control study classified 63 children scoring below the 16th percentile on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC-2) as probable DCD (pDCD), and 63 controls, all of whom scored above the 16th percentile. Metabolic syndrome was defined using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Eleven children met the criteria for MetS; 8 (72.3%) with pDCD and 3 (27.3%) controls (p = 0.115). Abdominal obesity was found in 39 (30.9%) of children, 29 (46.0%) with pDCD and 10 (15.9%) controls (p < 0.01). Serum triglycerides were higher in pDCD compared to controls, 91.9 mg/dl (63.1) vs. 67.7 mg/dl (33.3) in the control group, p = 0.001. Blood pressure was also significantly higher in the pDCD group, mean systolic BP (110 vs. 105 mmHg, p = 0.01) and mean diastolic BP (69 vs. 65 mmHg, p = 0.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the groups for other components of MetS. The higher prevalence of abdominal obesity and elevated triglycerides and blood pressure in children with pDCD may put them at risk of meeting all criteria of MetS earlier then their peers.",
