  "title": "Effect of the GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise Program on Physical Function in Older Adults.",
  "abstract": "GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise is a therapeutic dance program for older adults with cognitive or mobility impairments. Using a pre-/posttest study design, we investigated the effect of 12 weeks of dance on the short performance physical battery (SPPB). In 107 participants aged 61-93 (mean 76.1, SD = 7.0; 20% men), over 90% had multifrailty and/or cognitive impairment. The mean attendance rate was 18/24 classes (75%). A substantial minimal clinically important difference (>0.4) occurred for SPPB total (+0.53, SD = 2.04, p = .002) and chair stands (+0.45, SD = 0.92, p < .001). Individuals with baseline SPPB â‰¤8 points (n = 38)-indicative of sarcopenia and physical frailty-had the most marked improvement (SPPB total: +1.45, SD = 1.97, p < .001; balance: +0.65, SD = 1.27, p = .006; chair stands: +0.68, SD = 0.97, p < .001). GERAS DANcing for Cognition and Exercise may be a promising rehabilitation intervention to improve daily physical function.",
