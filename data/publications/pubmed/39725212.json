  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) affects different patient populations that require unique considerations in their management. However, no HS guidelines for these populations exist. OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence-based consensus recommendations for patients with HS in 7 special patient populations: (i) pregnancy, (ii) breastfeeding, (iii) pediatrics, (iv) malignancy, (v) tuberculosis infection, (vi) hepatitis B or C infection, and (vii) HIV disease. METHODS: Recommendations were developed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system to ascertain level of evidence and selected through a modified Delphi consensus process. RESULTS: One hundred eighteen expert consensus statements are provided for the management of patients with HS across these 7 special patient populations.",
