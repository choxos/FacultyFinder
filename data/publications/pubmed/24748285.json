  "title": "Atypical hip pain: coexistence of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and osteoid osteoma.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this article was to emphasize the importance of including less common causes of hip pain in a differential diagnosis, particularly when clinical and radiographic variables are atypical. This article presents the case of a 52-year-old patient with a history of progressive hip pain resulting from the coexistence of both a femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and an intraarticular osteoid osteoma. The intraarticular osteoid osteoma was initially overlooked due to its unremarkable features on radiographic and resonance imaging. Consequently, the patient was surgically treated for FAI with only partial relief. An osteolytic nidus characteristic of osteoid osteoma was discovered only 1.5 years following surgery. The patient was subsequently treated for osteoid osteoma with anti-inflammatories, after which his pain began to resolve. The patient was completely pain free after 7 months. Level of evidence V.",
