  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of artemisinin-based combination and monotherapy by community members and the administrative practices of health professionals in treating malaria in Ghana. METHOD: This study is a community-based cross-sectional survey in 11 rural and urban areas in southern Ghana. Using the interviewer method, close-ended questionnaires were administered to community members. Similar questionnaires were also administered in health facilities, community pharmacies and licensed chemical shops. RESULTS: A total of 1085 individuals comprising 959 non-health professionals and 126 health professionals were interviewed. Fifty-seven per cent of the community members visit pharmacies/drug stores as the first point of call when they suspect malaria. According to the participating drug sellers, artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the most prescribed/sold anti-malarial drug (59.2%), followed by dihydroartemisinin (35%), sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (33.0%) and artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) (27.2%). The majority of customers who visit pharmacies or drug stores without prescription have their anti-malarial drug selected by the shop attendant; in situations like that, dihydroartemisinin and artesunate monotherapies are sold just as AS-AQ and AL. Chloroquine is still sold by some drug vendors, 5 years after its proscription. CONCLUSION: Whereas the use of AS-AQ and AL are acceptable, the frequent use of dihydroartemisinin and artesunate monotherapy threatens the future of ACTs.",
