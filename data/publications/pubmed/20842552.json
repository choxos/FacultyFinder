  "title": "New and emerging anticoagulant therapies for venous thromboembolism.",
  "abstract": "Anticoagulation therapy remains the cornerstone for prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. Currently available parenteral anticoagulants, such as heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux, are used widely for short-term therapy, but the need for parenteral administration limits their utility for long-term use. Vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, are the only oral anticoagulants available for long-term use. Although effective, these drugs produce a variable anticoagulant response and require routine coagulation monitoring and frequent dose adjustments. New anticoagulants that can be given in fixed doses without monitoring have been developed to overcome the limitations of existing agents. These drugs are in advanced stages of development and have the potential to streamline the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism.",
