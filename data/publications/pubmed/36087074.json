  "abstract": "Although inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] affects an increasingly diverse patient population, most patients in IBD clinical trials are White. Acknowledging current barriers and taking meaningful action is required at multiple levels to improve racial diversity across clinical trials in IBD. Ultimately, improving racial diversity in trials can in turn improve the care received by the diverse patients seen in clinical practice.",
