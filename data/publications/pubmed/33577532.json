  "title": "Burst-mode dual-comb spectroscopy.",
  "abstract": "We introduce a new, to the best of our knowledge, modality of dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) that enables a simplified and powerful new approach for time-resolved measurements with increased acquisition rates. This \"burst mode\" form of DCS relies on the multiplexing of each probe pulse into a short train of pulses. With this approach we demonstrate a time-resolved series of absorption-based spectroscopic measurements of a laser-induced plasma using only a single laser ablation shot and identify 22 Nd lines not previously reported in the literature. The transmission spectra spanned 3.1 THz and were acquired at an effective acquisition rate of 25 kHz with 40 µs time resolution. This simple modification to ∼100MHz level dual-comb systems provides a flexible approach for studying transient and low-duty-cycle events such as laser-induced plasmas, combustion, and explosive reactions.",
