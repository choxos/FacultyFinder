  "title": "The RNA m5C modification in R-loops as an off switch of Alt-NHEJ.",
  "abstract": "The roles of R-loops and RNA modifications in homologous recombination (HR) and other DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair pathways remain poorly understood. Here, we find that DNA damage-induced RNA methyl-5-cytosine (m5C) modification in R-loops plays a crucial role to regulate PARP1-mediated poly ADP-ribosylation (PARylation) and the choice of DSB repair pathways at sites of R-loops. Through bisulfite sequencing, we discover that the methyltransferase TRDMT1 preferentially generates m5C after DNA damage in R-loops across the genome. In the absence of m5C, R-loops activate PARP1-mediated PARylation both in vitro and in cells. Concurrently, m5C promotes transcription-coupled HR (TC-HR) while suppressing PARP1-dependent alternative non-homologous end joining (Alt-NHEJ), favoring TC-HR over Alt-NHEJ in transcribed regions as the preferred repair pathway. Importantly, simultaneous disruption of both TC-HR and Alt-NHEJ with TRDMT1 and PARP or Polymerase Î¸ inhibitors prevents alternative DSB repair and exhibits synergistic cytotoxic effects on cancer cells, suggesting an effective strategy to exploit genomic instability in cancer therapy.",
