  "title": "Exploration of metformin as novel therapy for osteoarthritis: preventing cartilage degeneration and reducing pain behavior.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metformin could activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) which was postulated as a potential therapeutic target for osteoarthritis. This study aimed to examine the effects of metformin on cartilage and pain in osteoarthritis mouse model. METHODS: Eighty 10-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were randomized to 6 groups: non-operation, sham-operation, destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-operation with intragastric saline/metformin, and DMM-operation with intraarticular saline/metformin. Articular cartilage degeneration was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and graded using the scoring system recommended by Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI). Mechanical withdrawal threshold and hind paw weight distribution were measured to assess the pain-related behavior. Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blot analysis were conducted to examine the anabolic and anti-catabolic effect of metformin and the role of AMPK in mediating its effects on interleukin-1Î² stimulated primary mice chondrocytes. RESULTS: Compared with mice receiving intragastric and intraarticular saline, mice in both intragastric and intraarticular metformin displayed attenuated articular cartilage degeneration, indicated by less cartilage damage under SEM and significantly lower OARSI scores. A higher paw withdrawal threshold and a decreased weight-bearing asymmetry were observed in the intragastric and intraarticular metformin mice compared with their corresponding saline groups in DMM model of osteoarthritis. In vitro experiments showed that metformin not only decreased the level of matrix metalloproteinase 13, but also elevated type II collagen production through activating AMPK pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Metformin attenuates osteoarthritis structural worsening and modulates pain, suggesting its potential for osteoarthritis prevention or treatment.",
