  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to construct a comprehensive framework of research dissemination and utilization that is useful for both health policy and clinical decision-making. ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT: The framework illustrates that the process of the adoption of research evidence into health-care decision-making is influenced by a variety of characteristics related to the individual, organization, environment and innovation. The framework also demonstrates the complex inter-relationships among these characteristics as progression through the five stages of innovation namely, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation occurs. Finally, the framework integrates the concepts of research dissemination, evidence-based decision-making and research utilization within the diffusion of innovations theory. METHODS: During the discussion of each stage of the innovation adoption process, relevant literature from the management field (i.e., diffusion of innovations, organizational management and decision-making) and health-care sector (i.e., research dissemination and utilization and evidence-based practice) is summarized. Studies providing empirical data contributing to the development of the framework were assessed for methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: The process of research dissemination and utilization is complex and determined by numerous intervening variables related to the innovation (research evidence), organization, environment and individual.",
