  "title": "A phase II study of cediranib, an oral VEGF inhibitor, in previously untreated patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: A two stage multi-institution Phase II study was undertaken by the Princess Margaret Hospital Consortium to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of oral cediranib, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2, in patients with previously untreated advanced malignant melanoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between May 2006 and April 2008, 24 patients (median age 65 years) with advanced malignant melanoma were treated with oral cediranib. Cediranib was given on a continuous, oral once daily schedule of 45 mg, on a 28 day cycle. RESULTS: Of the 17 patients evaluable for response, there was stable disease in 8 patients, and progressive disease in 9 patients, with no objective responses seen. Only 2 patients had stable disease >/= 6 months, thus the study was terminated at the end of stage 1 accrual. The overall median survival was 9.9 months, and the median time to progression was 3.5 months. The most frequent non-hematologic adverse events were hypertension (78%), fatigue (69%), diarrhea (69%) and anorexia and nausea (each 57%). CONCLUSIONS: Although 2 patients had stable disease at 6 months, the short median time to progression and lack of any objective responses indicate that single agent cediranib at this dose and schedule is not sufficiently active to warrant study continuation.",
