  "title": "Magnesium and Fracture Risk in the General Population and Patients Receiving Dialysis: A Narrative Review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Magnesium is an essential mineral for bone metabolism, but little is known about how magnesium intake alters fracture risk. We conducted a narrative review to better understand how magnesium intake, through supplementation, diet, or altering the concentration of dialysate magnesium, affects mineral bone disease and the risk of fracture in individuals across the spectrum of kidney disease. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Peer-reviewed clinical trials and observational studies. METHODS: We searched for relevant articles in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. The methodologic quality of clinical trials was assessed using a modified version of the Downs and Black criteria checklist. KEY FINDINGS: The role of magnesium intake in fracture prevention is unclear in both the general population and in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. In those with normal kidney function, 2 meta-analyses showed higher bone mineral density in those with higher dietary magnesium, whereas 1 systematic review showed no effect on fracture risk. In patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, a higher concentration of dialysate magnesium is associated with a lower concentration of parathyroid hormone, but little is known about other bone-related outcomes. In 2 observational studies of patients receiving hemodialysis, a higher concentration of serum magnesium was associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. LIMITATIONS: This narrative review included only articles written in English. Observed effects of magnesium intake in the general population may not be applicable to those with chronic kidney disease particularly in those receiving dialysis.",
