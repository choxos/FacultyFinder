  "abstract": "Pathological changes in the biomechanical environment are implicated in the progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Stiffened matrix augments fibroblast proliferation and differentiation and activates TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β1). Stiffened matrix impairs the synthesis of the antifibrogenic lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and reduces the expression of the rate-limiting prostanoid biosynthetic enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). We now show that prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES), the final enzyme in the PGE2 biosynthetic pathway, is expressed at lower levels in the lungs of patients with IPF. We also show substantial induction of COX-2, PTGES, prostaglandin E receptor 4 (EP4), and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) expression in human lung fibroblasts cultured in soft collagen hydrogels or in spheroids compared with conventional culture on stiff plastic culture plates. Induction of COX-2, cPLA2, and PTGES expression in spheroid cultures was moderately inhibited by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor SB203580. The induction of prostanoid biosynthetic enzyme expression was accompanied by an increase in PGE2 levels only in non-IPF-derived fibroblast spheroids. Our study reveals an extensive dysregulation of prostanoid biosynthesis and signaling pathways in IPF-derived fibroblasts, which are only partially abrogated by culture in soft microenvironments.",
