  "title": "Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Cardiac Surgery: No Left Atrial Appendage Shall Remain Untouched.",
  "abstract": "The Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study III randomized 4,811 patients with atrial fibrillation and a CHA2DS2VASc score â‰¥2 undergoing cardiac surgery to surgical left atrial appendage occlusion or no occlusion. At a mean follow-up of 3.8 years, stroke or systemic embolism was reduced by 33% in the occlusion group with no evidence of early or late adverse effects. This review discusses the implication of these findings.",
