  "title": "A Feeding Adequacy Scale for Children With Bronchiolitis: Prospective Multicenter Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the measurement properties of the Feeding Adequacy Scale (FAS) in young children hospitalized with bronchiolitis. METHODS: Multicenter cohort study of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis at children's and community hospitals in Ontario, Canada. Caregivers and nurses completed the FAS, a 10-cm visual analog scale anchored by \"not feeding at all\" (score 0) and \"feeding as when healthy\" (score 10). The main outcome measures were feasibility, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the FAS. RESULTS: A total of 228 children were included with an average (SD) age of 6.3 (5.4) months. Completing the FAS was feasible for caregivers and nurses, with no floor or ceiling effects. Test-retest reliability was moderate for caregivers (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] 2,1 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.80) and good for nurses (ICC 2,1 0.75; 95% CI 0.62-0.83). Interrater reliability between 1 caregiver and 1 nurse was moderate (ICC 1,1 0.55; 95% CI 0.45-0.64). For construct validity, the FAS was negatively associated with length of hospital stay and positively associated with both caregiver and nurse readiness for discharge scores (P values <.0001). The FAS demonstrated clinical improvement from the first FAS score at admission to the last FAS score at discharge, with significant differences between scores for both caregivers and nurses (P values for paired t test <.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results provide evidence of the feasibility, reliability, validity, and responsiveness of caregiver-completed and nurse-completed FAS as a measure of feeding adequacy in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis.",
