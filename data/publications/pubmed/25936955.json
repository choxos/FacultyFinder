  "title": "Association of lipid profile alterations with severe forms of dengue in humans.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have shown a relationship between circulating lipids and dengue virus infection; however, the association of altered lipid profiles with severe dengue remains little studied. The aim of this study was to determine the association between circulating lipid content and severe dengue and/or platelet counts. Ninety-eight patients (2-66 years old) classified as having dengue without warning signs (DNWS), dengue with warning signs (DWWS), or severe dengue (SD) and 62 healthy individuals were studied. Blood samples were tested for NS1, anti-dengue IgM, platelet content, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (T), high-density lipoproteins (HDL), low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). Lipid alterations were observed mainly in patients with SD. Increased T and VLDL was observed in SD, and increased HDL was observed in DWWS and SD. Decreased TC was found in all forms of dengue, and the lowest LDL values were found in SD. Platelet counts were significantly decreased in DWWS and SD when compare to DNWS. A positive correlation (p = 0.019) between LDL values and platelet counts and a negative correlation (p = 0.0162) between VLDL values and platelet counts were found. Lipid profile alterations were associated with severe dengue.",
