  "title": "Perioperative randomised controlled trials: to pilot or not to pilot?",
  "abstract": "The science of pilot trials is evolving, and understanding of their role in medical research is increasing. Perioperative randomised controlled trials often test interventions that are inherently multidisciplinary and complex; therefore, there might be compelling reasons to conduct pilot studies to assess feasibility and inform trial design. As pilot studies themselves require resources, investigators should not squander this opportunity; they should design them so that they properly address the sources of uncertainty regarding the success of the definitive trial.",
