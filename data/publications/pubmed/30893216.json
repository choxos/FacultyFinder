  "title": "Short Versus Long InterTAN Fixation for Geriatric Intertrochanteric Hip Fractures: A Multicentre Head-to-Head Comparison.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine if geriatric intertrochanteric hip fracture patients achieve equivalent postoperative functional status after management with either a short (180-200 mm) or a long (260-460 mm) InterTAN intramedullary device. DESIGN: Retrospective review of a prospective randomized control trial. SETTING: Four Level I Trauma Centers. PATIENTS/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred eight patients with OTA/AO classification 31A-1 and 31A-2 intertrochanteric hip fractures were included in the study. INTERVENTION: Internal fixation using an IT device. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Primary outcomes included Functional Independence Measure and Timed Up and Go. Secondary outcomes included blood loss, surgical time, length of stay, adverse events, and mortality. RESULTS: Seventy-one short and 37 long IT patients met study inclusion criteria. Demographics were similar between groups. There was no difference in Functional Independence Measure or Timed Up and Go scores between the 2 IT groups at any of the time points collected. Mean operative time was lower in the short IT group than in the long IT group (60 vs. 73 minutes; P = 0.021). A higher proportion of long IT patients had reamed constructs (95% vs. 48% short IT, P < 0.001). Postoperative blood loss was significantly higher in the long IT group without a significant influence on the number of patients requiring transfusion (P = 0.582) or average units transfused (P = 0.982). There was no significant difference in the proportion of postoperative adverse events between the 2 cohorts despite a higher number of peri-implant femur fractures in the short IT group than in the long IT group (5 vs. 1, P = 0.350). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative functional status was not influenced by the length of IT device in the management of geriatric intertrochanteric hip fractures. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level III.
