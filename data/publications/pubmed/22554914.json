  "title": "Case study methodology in nurse migration research: an integrative review.",
  "abstract": "The migration of nurses combined with a global nursing shortage affects the supply of nurses and access to health services in many countries. The purpose of this article was to conduct an integrative review of case study methodology (CSM) in nurse migration research. Findings identify where studies using CSM have been conducted, by whom, and the themes explored. More studies using CSM are required to answer the important \"how\" and \"why\" questions related to nurse migration. Nurses should take a leadership role in this research.",
