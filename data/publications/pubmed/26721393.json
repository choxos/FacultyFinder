  "title": "Abnormal myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 phosphorylation and actin polymerization contribute to impaired myogenic regulation of cerebral arterial diameter in the type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat.",
  "abstract": "The myogenic response of cerebral resistance arterial smooth muscle to intraluminal pressure elevation is a key physiological mechanism regulating blood flow to the brain. Rho-associated kinase plays a critical role in the myogenic response by activating Ca[2+] sensitization mechanisms: (i) Rho-associated kinase inhibits myosin light chain phosphatase by phosphorylating its targeting subunit myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 (at T855), augmenting 20 kDa myosin regulatory light chain (LC20) phosphorylation and force generation; and (ii) Rho-associated kinase stimulates cytoskeletal actin polymerization, enhancing force transmission to the cell membrane. Here, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal Rho-associated kinase-mediated myosin light chain phosphatase regulation underlies the dysfunctional cerebral myogenic response of the Goto-Kakizaki rat model of type 2 diabetes. Basal levels of myogenic tone, LC20, and MYPT1-T855 phosphorylation were elevated and G-actin content was reduced in arteries of pre-diabetic 8-10 weeks Goto-Kakizaki rats with normal serum insulin and glucose levels. Pressure-dependent myogenic constriction, LC20, and myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1 phosphorylation and actin polymerization were suppressed in both pre-diabetic Goto-Kakizaki and diabetic (18-20 weeks) Goto-Kakizaki rats, whereas RhoA, ROK2, and MYPT1 expression were unaffected. We conclude that abnormal Rho-associated kinase-mediated Ca[2+] sensitization contributes to the dysfunctional cerebral myogenic response in the Goto-Kakizaki model of type 2 diabetes.",
