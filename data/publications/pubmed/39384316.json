  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The predicted prevalence of people with dementia (PWD) in Germany has risen to 1.8 million since 2010. In the near future, we will see the approval of antibody therapies. The study aims to demonstrate the recent anti-dementia medication prescriptions and diagnosis prevalence. METHODS: Data from 357 general practitioner (GP) and 71 specialist practices (SP) (1.1 Mio. patients) were analyzed to demonstrate the prevalence of dementia diagnoses and anti-dementia drug prescriptions between 2010 and 2021. RESULTS: The diagnosis prevalence of PWD (Alzheimer's dementia) remained relatively constant in GP practices at 1.0-1.3% (0.19-0.21%). Among SP, the prevalence increased from 4.9% (2.8%) to 5.9% (3.6%). The anti-dementia prescription rate decreased in GP (from 0.14% to 0.10%) and increased in SP practices (from 2.1% to 2.4%). DISCUSSION: The diagnosis and prescription rate, especially in GP practices, remained below the prevalence forecasts and the expected prescriptions.",
