  "title": "Remimazolam as the Primary Agent for Sedation During Cardiac Catheterization in Three Patients With Comorbid Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities.",
  "abstract": "General anesthesia or procedural sedation may be required to ensure immobility, facilitate completion of the procedure, and ensure patient comfort during diagnostic or therapeutic procedures in the cardiac catheterization suite. Although propofol and dexmedetomidine are two of the more commonly chosen agents, concerns regarding their impact on inotropic, chronotropic or dromotropic function may limit their applicability based on underlying patient comorbid conditions. We present three patients with comorbid conditions involving pacemaker (natural or implanted) function or cardiac conduction which impacted the choice of agent for procedural sedation during procedures in the cardiac catheterization suite. Remimazolam, a novel ester-metabolized benzodiazepine, was used as the primary agent for sedation in an effort to limit detrimental effects on chronotropic and dromotropic function which may be seen with propofol or dexmedetomidine. Remimazolam's potential utility in procedural sedation is discussed, previous reports of its use are reviewed, and dosing algorithms are presented.",
