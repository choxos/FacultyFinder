  "title": "Streptomyces geranii sp. nov., a novel endophytic actinobacterium isolated from root of Geranium carolinianum L.",
  "abstract": "A novel endophytic actinomycete, designated A301[T], was isolated from the root of Geranium carolinianum Linn collected from Mount Emei in China and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Growth occurred at 10-37 Â°C, pH 6-11 and in the presence of 0-5 % NaCl (w/v). Strain A301[T] contained ll-diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The whole-cell hydrolysates included galactose and ribose. The predominant menaquinones were MK-9(H6) and MK-9(H8). The major cellular fatty acids were C15 : 0, C16 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0. The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, two unidentified phospholipids, three unidentified lipids and two unidentified aminophospholipids. Strain A301[T] shared the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to Streptomyces cinereorubersubsp. fructofermentans NBRC 15396[T] (98.1 %) and Streptomyces turgidiscabies ATCC 700248[T] (98.1 %). The DNA-DNA relatedness values between strain A301[T] and the two above-mentioned members of the genus Streptomyces were 42.6 % and 47.2 %, respectively. The G+C content of the DNA was 70.5 mol%. On the basis of the polyphasic approach and DNA-DNA hybridization data, strain A301[T] represents a novel species within the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces geranii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is A301[T] (=CGMCC 4.7422[T]=JCM 32177[T]).",
