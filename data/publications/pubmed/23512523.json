  "title": "Hepatoprotective potential of new steroid against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury.",
  "abstract": "The present study was designed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of newly isolated stigmast-4, 20 (21), 23-trien-3-one (STO) against carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury in Wistar albino rats. Hepatotoxicity was induced by the administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of CCl4 (0.5 mL/kg CCl4 in olive oil) in experimental rats. Three different doses (2.5, 5.0, and 10 mg/kg, p.o) of STO was administered to the test groups during whole experimental protocol. Changes in the activity of serum ALT, AST, ALP, TB, and TP, anti-oxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and LPO were studied in CCl4-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The altered levels of serum ALT, AST, ALP, TB, and TP restored toward normalization significantly by STO in a dose dependant manner. The biochemical observations were supplemented with histopathological examination of rat liver sections. Meanwhile, it also produced a significant and dose-dependent reversal of CCl4-diminished activity of anti-oxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and the reduced CCl4-elevated level of LPO. STO significantly prevented the increased levels of serum markers, also suppressed the free radical processes by scavenging hydroxyl radicals. It also modulates the levels of LPO and markedly increases the endogenous anti-oxidant enzymes level in CCl4-induced hepatic injury.",
