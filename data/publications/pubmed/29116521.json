  "title": "High-Throughput IgG Reformatting and Expression.",
  "abstract": "We have recently described a one-step zero-background IgG reformatting method that enables the rapid reformatting of phage-displayed antibody fragments into a single-mammalian cell expression vector for full IgG expression (Chen et al. Nucleic Acids Res 42:e26, 2014). The strategy utilizes our unique positive selection method, referred to as insert-tagged (InTag) positive selection, where a positive selection marker (e.g. chloramphenicol-resistance gene) is cloned together with the antibody inserts into the expression vector. The recombinant clones containing the InTag adaptor are then positively selected without cloning background, thus bypassing the need to plate out cultures and screen colonies. This IgG reformatting method is rapid and can be automated and performed in a high-throughput (HTP) format. The use of InTag positive selection with the Dyax Fab-on-phage antibody library is demonstrated. We have further optimized the protocol for IgG reformatting since the initial publication of this method (Chen et al. Nucleic Acids Res 42:e26, 2014) and also updated the transient transfection protocol using Expi293F cells, which are described herein.",
