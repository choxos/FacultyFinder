  "title": "Pulmonary endemic mycoses.",
  "abstract": "While rare, the likelihood of encountering a case of a pulmonary endemic mycosis (PEM) in the UK is increasing. Diagnosis may be challenging, often leading to considerable delay to appropriate treatment. Clinical suspicion must be present for respiratory disease, particularly in the immunocompromised or in those not responding to empiric treatment approaches, and an extended travel history should be obtained. This article summarises the epidemiology of PEM, key clinical features, diagnostic strategies and management.",
