  "title": "A two-day workshop reviewing Canadian provincial and national HIV care cascade indicators, reporting, challenges, and recommendations.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The HIV care cascade is an indicators-framework used to assess achievement of HIV clinical targets including HIV diagnosis, HIV care initiation and retention, initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and attainment of viral suppression for people living with HIV. METHODS: The HIV Care Cascade Research Development Team at the CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network Clinical Care and Management Core hosted a two-day virtual workshop to present HIV care cascade data collected nationally from local and provincial clinical settings and national cohort studies. The article summarizes the workshop presentations including the indicators used and available findings and presents the discussed challenges and recommendations. RESULTS: Identified challenges included (1) inconsistent HIV care cascade indicator definitions, (2) variability between the use of nested UNAIDS's targets and HIV care cascade indicators, (3) variable analytic approaches based on differing data sources, (4) reporting difficulties in some regions due to a lack of integration across data platforms, (5) lack of robust data on the first stage of the care cascade at the sub-national level, and (6) inability to integrate key socio-demographic data to estimate population-specific care cascade shortfalls. CONCLUSION: There were four recommendations: standardization of HIV care cascade indicators and analyses, additional funding for HIV care cascade data collection, database maintenance and analyses at all levels, qualitative interviews and case studies characterizing the stories behind the care cascade findings, and employing targeted positive-action programs to increase engagement of key populations in each HIV care cascade stage.",
