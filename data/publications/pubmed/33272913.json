  "title": "Prospective Cohort Study of Renin-Angiotensin System Blocker Usage after Hospitalized Acute Kidney Injury.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The risk-benefit ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker therapy after AKI may be altered due to concerns regarding recurrent AKI. We evaluated, in a prospective cohort, the association between use (versus nonuse) of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and the subsequent risk of AKI and other adverse outcomes after hospitalizations with and without AKI. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: We studied 1538 patients recently discharged from the hospital who enrolled in the multicenter, prospective ASSESS-AKI study, with approximately half of patients experiencing AKI during the index hospitalization. All participants were seen at a baseline visit 3 months after their index hospitalization and were categorized at that time on whether they were using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or not. We used multivariable Cox regression, adjusting for demographics, comorbidities, eGFR, urine protein-creatinine ratio, and use of other medications, to examine the association between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use and subsequent risks of AKI, death, kidney disease progression, and adjudicated heart-failure events. RESULTS: The use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers was 50% (386/769) among those with AKI during the index hospitalization and 47% (362/769) among those without. Among those with AKI during the index hospitalization, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use was not associated with a higher risk of recurrent hospitalized AKI (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.69 to 1.13). Associations between angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use and death, kidney disease progression, and adjudicated heart-failure events appeared similar in study participants who did and did not experience AKI during the index hospitalization (all interaction P values >0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The risk-benefit ratio of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker therapy after hospital discharge appears to be similar regardless of whether AKI occurred during the hospitalization.",
