  "title": "Variability in Cardiac Biomarkers during Hemodialysis: A Prospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The effect of hemodialysis on cardiac biomarkers is unclear. We sought to evaluate the degree and causes of intradialytic variability of high sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), galectin-3 (gal-3), and heart-type fatty acid binding protein (hFABP). METHODS: hs-TnI, gal-3, and hFABP were prospectively measured pre-dialysis and post-dialysis for 1 week every month for 6 months in 178 prevalent adult hemodialysis patients at a single center in Hamilton, Canada. The degree of change from pre-dialysis to post-dialysis for each cardiac biomarker was estimated with multilevel linear regression models. RESULTS: The median change in the concentration of hs-TnI during hemodialysis was -1 ng/L (interquartile range [IQR] -1 to 2 ng/L) while gal-3 and hFABP changed by -36.3 ng/mL (IQR -27.7 to -46.8 ng/mL) and -19.41 ng/mL (IQR -13.61 to -26.87 ng/mL), respectively. The median (IQR) percentage intradialytic changes for hs-TnI, gal-3, and hFABP were 2.6% (-4.4% to 12.5%), -59.8% (-54.7% to -64.8%) and -35.3% (-28.4% to -42.1%), respectively. Ultrafiltration was associated with an increase in concentration of hs-TnI, gal-3, and hFABP (mean 0.99 ng/L, 1.05 ng/mL, and 1.9 ng/mL per L ultrafiltration, respectively, P < 0.001). Both gal-3 and hFABP concentrations decreased in association with the volume of blood processed (P < 0.001) and with hemodialysis treatment time (P  = 0.02 and P  = 0.04) while hs-TnI concentration decreased only in association with hemodialysis treatment time (P  < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Ultrafiltration volume and hemodialysis treatment time influenced hs-TnI, gal-3, and hFABP concentrations during hemodialysis and should be considered when interpreting their measurement.",
