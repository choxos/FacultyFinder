  "title": "Effect of Ocrelizumab on B- and T-Cell Receptor Repertoire Diversity in Patients With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis From the Randomized Phase III OPERA Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The B cell-depleting anti-CD20 antibody ocrelizumab (OCR) effectively reduces MS disease activity and slows disability progression. Given the role of B cells as antigen-presenting cells, the primary goal of this study was to evaluate the effect of OCR on the T-cell receptor repertoire diversity. METHODS: To examine whether OCR substantially alters the molecular diversity of the T-cell receptor repertoire, deep immune repertoire sequencing (RepSeq) of CD4[+] and CD8[+] T-cell receptor β-chain variable regions was performed on longitudinal blood samples. The IgM and IgG heavy chain variable region repertoire was also analyzed to characterize the residual B-cell repertoire under OCR treatment. RESULTS: Peripheral blood samples for RepSeq were obtained from 8 patients with relapsing MS enrolled in the OPERA I trial over a period of up to 39 months. Four patients each were treated with OCR or interferon β1-a during the double-blind period of OPERA I. All patients received OCR during the open-label extension. The diversity of the CD4[+]/CD8[+] T-cell repertoires remained unaffected in OCR-treated patients. The expected OCR-associated B-cell depletion was mirrored by reduced B-cell receptor diversity in peripheral blood and a shift in immunoglobulin gene usage. Despite deep B-cell depletion, longitudinal persistence of clonally related B-cells was observed. DISCUSSION: Our data illustrate that the diversity of CD4[+]/CD8[+] T-cell receptor repertoires remained unaltered in OCR-treated patients with relapsing MS. Persistence of a highly diverse T-cell repertoire suggests that aspects of adaptive immunity remain intact despite extended anti-CD20 therapy. TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: This is a substudy (BE29353) of the OPERA I (WA21092; NCT01247324) trial. Date of registration, November 23, 2010; first patient enrollment, August 31, 2011.",
