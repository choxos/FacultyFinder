  "title": "Moving forward on both systematic reviews and deliberative processes.",
  "abstract": "Systematic reviews are increasingly seen as helpful \"knowledge support\" for managers and policy makers, and deliberative processes are starting to be seen as promising, locally contextualized \"decision support.\" Increases to the flow of systematic reviews should be complemented by efforts to facilitate the retrieval, and adapt the presentation, of the available stock of systematic reviews. Research and other evidence should be combined in transparent ways to facilitate cross-context learning. The challenge for managers and policy makers in moving forward will be to avoid the confusion that comes from the branding of both systematic reviews and deliberative processes.",
