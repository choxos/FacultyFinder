  "title": "Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater from dormitory buildings in a university campus: comparison with individual testing results.",
  "abstract": "Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) for monitoring COVID-19 has been largely used to detect the spread of the disease at the community level. From February to December 2022, we collected 24-h composite sewage samples from dormitory buildings in George Mason University (Fairfax, Virginia, USA) housing approximately 5,200 resident students. SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction was achieved using an automated system based on magnetic nanoparticles. Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed using reverse transcription quantitative PCR based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) N1 and N2 assays. From the 362 samples collected, 86% showed positive detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Wastewater monitoring was able to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 96% of the samples from buildings housing students with COVID-19. Over the period of study, we observed significant correlations between the SARS-CoV-2 concentration (copy number mL[-1]) in wastewater and the number of positive cases on campus based on individual saliva testing. Although several reports have been published on the wastewater monitoring of COVID-19 in university campuses, our study is one of the very few that provides results that were obtained during the last phase of the pandemic (roughly the year 2022), when the large majority of students were vaccinated and back on campus.",
