  "title": "Ultrastructure of differentiated malpighian tubules from cockroach nymphs during the molting cycle.",
  "abstract": "Differentiated Malpighian tubules of Periplaneta americana nymphs consist of four distinct regions. The distal, middle, and proximal regions are similar to the same regions in adult tubules. However, the transparent portion of the middle region was found to have ultrastructural characteristics different from those of the longer opaque segment of the middle region and the two other tubule regions. This newly distinguished region is called the lower middle region. Transitional zones, areas where cells show characteristics of two adjacent regions, are apparent between the distal and middle regions and between the middle and lower middle regions. The middle region of primary tubules undergoes an increase in autophagic activity and a modification of its basal infoldings and microvilli shortly before each molt. An increase in autophagic activity is also observed in the lower middle region near the time of molting.",
