  "title": "Physical Activity, Heart Rate Variability, and Ventricular Arrhythmia During the COVID-19 Lockdown: Retrospective Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) increase with stress and national disasters. Prior research has reported that VA did not increase during the onset of the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020, and the mechanism for this is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to report the presence of VA and changes in 2 factors associated with VA (physical activity and heart rate variability [HRV]) at the onset of COVID-19 lockdown measures in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) followed at a regional cardiac center in Ontario, Canada with data available for both HRV and physical activity between March 1 and 31, 2020, were included. HRV, physical activity, and the presence of VA were determined during the pre- (March 1-10, 2020) and immediate postlockdown (March 11-31) period. When available, these data were determined for the same period in 2019. RESULTS: In total, 68 patients had complete data for 2020, and 40 patients had complete data for 2019. Three (7.5%) patients had VA in March 2019, whereas none had VA in March 2020 (P=.048). Physical activity was reduced during the postlockdown period (mean 2.3, SD 1.6 hours vs mean 2.1, SD 1.6 hours; P=.003). HRV was unchanged during the pre- and postlockdown period (mean 91, SD 30 ms vs mean 92, SD 28 ms; P=.84). CONCLUSIONS: VA was infrequent during the COVID-19 pandemic. A reduction in physical activity with lockdown maneuvers may explain this observation.",
