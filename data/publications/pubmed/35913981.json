  "title": "Crude and adjusted comparisons of cesarean delivery rates using the Robson classification: A population-based cohort study in Canada and Sweden, 2004 to 2016.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Robson classification has become a global standard for comparing and monitoring cesarean delivery (CD) rates across populations and over time; however, this classification does not account for differences in important maternal, fetal, and obstetric practice factors known to impact CD rates. The objectives of our study were to identify subgroups of women contributing to differences in the CD rate in Sweden and British Columbia (BC), Canada using the Robson classification and to estimate the contribution of maternal, fetal/infant, and obstetric practice factors to differences in CD rates between countries and over time. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a population-based cohort study of deliveries in Sweden (January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2016; n = 1,392,779) and BC (March 1, 2004 to April 31, 2017; n = 559,205). Deliveries were stratified into Robson categories and the CD rate, relative size of each group and its contribution to the overall CD rate were compared between the Swedish and the Canadian cohorts. Poisson and log-binomial regression were used to assess the contribution of maternal, fetal, and obstetric practice factors to spatiotemporal differences in Robson group-specific CD rates between Sweden and BC. Nulliparous women comprised 44.8% of the study population, while women of advanced maternal age (≥35 years) and women with overweight/obesity (≥25 kg/m2) constituted 23.5% and 32.4% of the study population, respectively. The CD rate in Sweden was stable at approximately 17.0% from 2004 to 2016 (p for trend = 0.10), while the CD rate increased in BC from 29.4% to 33.9% (p for trend < 0.001). Differences in CD rates between Sweden and BC varied by Robson group, for example, in Group 1 (nullipara with a term, single, cephalic fetus with spontaneous labor), the CD rate was 8.1% in Sweden and 20.4% in BC (rate ratio [RR] for BC versus Sweden = 2.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.49 to 2.56, p < 0.001) and in Group 2 (nullipara, single, cephalic fetus, term gestation with induction of labor or prelabor CD), the rate of CD was 37.3% in Sweden and 45.9% in BC (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.25, p < 0.001). The effect of adjustment for maternal characteristics (e.g., age, body mass index), maternal comorbidity (e.g., preeclampsia), fetal characteristics (e.g., head position), and obstetric practice factors (e.g., epidural) ranged from no effect (e.g., among breech deliveries; Groups 6 and 7) to explaining up to 5.2% of the absolute difference in the CD rate (Group 2: adjusted CD rate in BC 40.7%, adjusted RR = 1.09, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.12, p < 0.001). Adjustment also explained a substantial fraction of the temporal change in CD rates among some Robson groups in BC. Limitations of the study include a lack of information on intrapartum details, such as labor duration as well as maternal and perinatal outcomes associated with the observed differences in CD rates. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we found that several factors not included in the Robson classification explain a significant proportion of the spatiotemporal difference in CD rates in some Robson groups. These findings suggest that incorporating these factors into explanatory models using the Robson classification may be useful for ensuring that public health initiatives regarding CD rates are evidence informed.",
