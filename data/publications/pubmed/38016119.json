  "abstract": "The Canadian health system is reeling following the COVID-19 pandemic. Strains have become growing cracks, with long emergency department wait times, shortage of human health resources, and growing dissatisfaction from both clinicians and patients. To address long-needed health system reform in Canada, a modernization of training is required for the next generation health leaders. The Canadian Institutes of Health Research Health System Impact Fellowship (HSIF) is an example of a well-funded and connected training program which prioritizes embedded research and embedding technically trained scholars with health system partners. The program has been successful in the scope and impact of its training outcomes as well as providing health system partners with a pool of connected and capable scholars. Looking forward, integrating aspects of evidence synthesis from both domestic and international sources and adapting a general contractor approach to implementation within the HSIF could help catalyze learning health system reform in Canada.",
