  "abstract": "KEY POINTS: Is performing a large definitive trial to establish the optimal anticoagulation strategy in dialysis recipients with atrial fibrillation feasible? One hundred fifty-one patients at 28 dialysis centers were enrolled and randomized to apixaban (n=51), warfarin (n=52), or no oral anticoagulation (n=48). Despite coronavirus disease–related pauses, recruitment was completed in 30 months, with 83% of participants completing follow-up in their assigned treatment arm. BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation is common in individuals receiving dialysis. The role of oral anticoagulation in this population is uncertain given its exclusion from previous seminal clinical trials. Our objective was to determine the feasibility of performing a large definitive trial to establish the optimal anticoagulation strategy in individuals with atrial fibrillation receiving dialysis. METHODS: The Strategies for the Management of Atrial Fibrillation in Patients Receiving Dialysis trial was a parallel-group, open-label, allocation-concealed, pilot randomized control trial that took place at 28 centers in Canada and Australia. The trial included adults (18 years or older) undergoing dialysis with a history of nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who met the CHADS-65 criteria. Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to receive dose-adjusted warfarin, apixaban 5 mg twice daily, or no oral anticoagulation and followed for 26 weeks. The primary outcomes evaluated the following measures of feasibility: (1) recruitment of the target population within 2 years from the start of the trial and (2) adherence of >80% of randomized patients to the allocated treatment strategy at the conclusion of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included stroke and bleeding. RESULTS: From December 2019 to June 2022, 151 patients were enrolled and randomized to apixaban (n=51), warfarin (n=52), or no oral anticoagulation (n=48). Allowing for pauses related to the coronavirus disease pandemic, recruitment was completed in 30 months, and 123 (83%) of participants completed follow-up in their allocated treatment arm. There was one adjudicated stroke event. Eight participants had a major bleeding event (four warfarin, two apixaban, two no oral anticoagulation). Death occurred in 15 participants (nine warfarin, two apixaban, four no oral anticoagulation). Time in the therapeutic range for warfarin recipients was 58% (interquartile range, 47%–70%). CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated the feasibility of recruitment and adherence in a trial that compared different anticoagulation strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation receiving dialysis.
