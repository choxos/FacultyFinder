  "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric condition that results in significant distress and impairment, and high societal costs. OCD is widely considered to be a chronic condition, however, our understanding of the chronicity of the disorder, and the incidence of spontaneous remission, has largely relied on longitudinal studies of individuals who have received treatment. The aim of the current study is to examine symptom improvement and rate of spontaneous remission in individuals with OCD who were assigned to a no-treatment control group within a randomized controlled trial using a meta-analytic approach. Twelve studies (n = 282; mean age = 35.52; 60.03 % female) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled within-group effect size was negligible (g = -0.14; 95 % CI [-0.25, -0.04]) and only 4 % of participants demonstrated spontaneous remission across an average of 10.92 weeks (event rate = 0.04; [95 % CI: 0.01, 0.11]). Sample size and duration of OCD symptoms significantly moderated the effect size for symptom change. No moderators were found for symptom remission. The findings add to the small body of literature demonstrating that OCD has a chronic and unremitting course without treatment.",
