  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: We report the identification of 3,6-dihydroxy-1,2-benzisoxazole (DHB) in a screen of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus, whose symbiotic relationship with eukaryotic nematodes favors secondary metabolites that meet several requirements matching those for clinically useful antibiotics. DHB is produced by Photorhabdus laumondii and is selective against the Gram-negative species Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter baumannii. It is inactive against anaerobic gut bacteria and nontoxic to human cells. Mutants resistant to DHB map to the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway. DHB binds to 4-hydroxybenzoate octaprenyltransferase (UbiA) and prevents the formation of 4-hydroxy-3-octaprenylbenzoate. Remarkably, DHB itself is prenylated, forming an unusable chimeric product that likely contributes to the toxic effect of this antimicrobial. DHB appears to be both a competitive enzyme inhibitor and a prodrug; this dual mode of action is unusual for an antimicrobial compound. IMPORTANCE: The spread of resistant pathogens has led to the antimicrobial resistance crisis, and the need for new compounds acting against Gram-negative pathogens is especially acute. From a screen of Photorhabdus symbionts of nematodes, we identified 3,6-dihydroxy-1,2-benzisoxazole (DHB) that acts against a range of Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. DHB had previously been isolated from other bacterial species, but its mechanism of action remained unknown. We show that DHB is unique among antimicrobials, with dual action as an inhibitor of an important enzyme, UbiA, in the biosynthesis pathway of ubiquinone and as a prodrug. DHB is a mimic of the natural substrate, and UbiA modifies it into a toxic product, contributing to the antimicrobial action of this unusual antibiotic. We also uncover the mechanism of DHB selectivity, which depends on a particular fold of the UbiA enzyme.",
