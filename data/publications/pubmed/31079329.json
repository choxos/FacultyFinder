  "title": "Inhibition of Hyperuricemia and Gouty Arthritis in BALB/c Mice Using Copper Oxide Nanoparticles.",
  "abstract": "Nanoparticles are known for their unique properties and are being utilized in various disciplines of sciences. Their nanosize enables them to higher exposure and higher availability when given orally. Gout is an inflammatory disease caused by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition into the joints. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles on hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in mice. In this research, synthesized copper oxide nanoparticles of size ranging from 30 to 50 nm were administered orally to mice having gouty arthritis and hyperuricemia. Various biochemical markers were conducted to determine the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles. It was observed that the mice treated with CuO NPs at various concentrations showed a significant (0.001) decrease in the serum uric acid levels in comparison with the negative control. Furthermore, creatinine levels were also normal in comparison with the control mice. Measurement of synovial joints also revealed that mice administered with CuO NPs had reduced inflammation of synovial joints in comparison with the negative control. From this research, it was concluded that copper oxide nanoparticles have potential in the treatment of hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis by decreasing serum uric acid and inflammation in synovial joints.",
