  "title": "Effects of pumpless extracorporeal lung assist on hemodynamics, gas exchange and inflammatory cascade response during experimental lung injury.",
  "abstract": "Pumpless extracorporeal lung assist (pECLA) has been reported to efficiently remove the systemic CO2 production and provide mild to moderate oxygenation, thereby allowing for ventilator settings and modes prioritizing oxygenation and lung protection. However, an adequate bypass flow, the capacity to provide respiratory support and the effect on the inflammatory cascade response and tissue perfusion require further study to be determined. After induction of acute lung injury (ALI) by oleic acid injection, pECLA was implemented in 12 anaesthetized and mechanically ventilated dogs for 48 h. Improved oxygenation [partial oxygen pressure (PaO2) and oxygen saturation (SaO2) was measured by arterial blood gas analysis, and increased by 29 and 18%, respectively] and CO2 elimination (partial CO2 pressure decreased by 43.35%) were obtained after pECLA implementation. A maximum arterio-venous shunt flow of up to 25% of the foundational CO resulted in stable hemodynamics. The pECLA procedure did not elicit any further increase in the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-Î±, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and endothelin-1 compared with that in the group subjected to oleic acid injection only. In addition, the pECLA procedure had no effect on lactate levels and urine production. In conclusion, pECLA is an efficient and promising strategy for providing a mild to moderate oxygenation and adequate decarboxylation, while avoiding excessive inflammatory cascade response and tissue hypoperfusion in an experimental ALI model.",
