  "title": "German Translation and Linguistic Validation of the LIMBâ€‘Q: A Patient-reported Outcome Measure for Lower Extremity Trauma.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lower extremity trauma can have a significant impact on a patient's quality of life. The LIMB-Q is a recently developed and validated patient-reported outcome measure that assesses patient-specific outcomes and experience of health care. The aim of this study was to translate and linguistically validate the LIMB-Q from English to German. METHODS: The translation was performed by combining World Health Organization and Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research guidelines. The process consisted of forward translations, a backward translation, expert panel meetings, cognitive debriefing interviews with patients, and several rounds of discussion and reconciliation with the creators of LIMB-Q. The goal was to obtain a culturally and conceptually accurate translation of LIMB-Q into German for use in Switzerland. RESULTS: From the two forward translations, there was one primary discrepancy between the two translators that was discussed to determine the most conceptually accurate translation. From the backward translations, there were 63 items that required discussion and re-translation. Nine patients participated in the cognitive debriefing interviews, which led to three items being modified. The translation process led to a linguistically validated and conceptually equivalent German version of the LIMB-Q. CONCLUSIONS: The German (Switzerland) version of LIMB-Q is now available. This will offer a valuable tool for lower extremity trauma research and clinical care in German-speaking populations.",
