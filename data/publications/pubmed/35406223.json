  "title": "Formulation of Piperine Nanoparticles: In Vitro Breast Cancer Cell Line and In Vivo Evaluation.",
  "abstract": "Piperine (PPN), one of the most investigated phytochemicals, is known to have excellent therapeutic efficacy against a variety of ailments including breast cancer. However, its physicochemical properties such as poor aqueous solubility restrict its clinical application. Therefore, the present investigation was designed to develop PPN encapsulated lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles (PPN-LPHNPs) to overcome the limitation. The developed PPN-LPHNPs were optimized by the three-factor, three-level Boxâˆ’Behnken design (33-BBD). The optimized PPN-LPHNPs were then evaluated for their drug release profile, cytotoxicity assay against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and gastrointestinal stability as well as colloidal stability. In addition, the optimized PPN-LPHNPs were evaluated for ex vivo intestinal permeation and in vivo pharmacokinetic in albino Wistar rats. As per the results, the optimized PPN-LPHNPs showed a small average particles size of <160 nm with a low (<0.3) polydispersity index, and highly positive surface charge (>+20 mV). PPN-LPHNPs revealed excellent gastrointestinal as well as colloidal stability and sustained release profiles up to 24 h. Furthermore, PPN-LPHNPs revealed excellent cytotoxicity against both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cancer cells compared to the free PPN. Moreover, animal studies revealed that the PPN-LPHNPs exhibited a 6.02- and 4.55-fold higher intestinal permeation and relative oral bioavailability, respectively, in comparison to the conventional PPN suspension. Thus, our developed LPHNPs present a strong potential for improved delivery of PPN.",
