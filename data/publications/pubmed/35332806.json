  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inpatient management and outcomes of patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with a history of heart failure (HF) have not been well characterized. METHODS: Hospitalizations for AMI from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2015-2018) were categorized according to a preexisting diagnosis of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), or absence of HF. Utilization of invasive management and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS: Among 2,434,639 hospitalizations with an AMI, 19.8% had a history of HFrEF and 11.9% had a history of HFpEF. Coronary angiography and PCI respectively were performed significantly less among patients with HF (36.6% and 17.4% in HFpEF, 51.1% and 24.6% in HFrEF, and 64.4% and 42.3% among patients without HF, all p < 0.0001). Mortality was more common among patients with HFrEF (10.3%) and HFpEF (8.3%) when compared to patients without a history of HF (6.4%), p < 0.0001. CONCLUSION: HF is a common preexisting comorbidity among patients presenting with AMI and is associated with lower utilization of invasive procedures and higher complications including mortality, particularly among those with HFrEF.",
