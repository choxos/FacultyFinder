  "title": "Predictors of outcome at 2-year follow-up after arthroscopic treatment of femoro-acetabular impingement.",
  "abstract": "Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) is a common cause of hip pain and dysfunction in the young and active population. Despite reports of good short-term outcomes following treatment for FAI, less is known about the possible preoperative predictors of treatment outcome. The purpose of this study was to identify predictors of treatment outcome, using a patient-reported outcome measurement score (PROM) validated for use in a young and active population undergoing arthroscopic surgery for FAI. Patients were prospectively enrolled and analysed using the PROM International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12) preoperatively and at a 2-year follow-up. Predictors of treatment outcome chosen for analysis were age, gender, duration of symptoms until surgery, level of cartilage damage, preoperative score and FAI type. A total of 198 patients, 122 males and 76 females (M: 61.6%, F: 38.4%), with a mean age of 41 ± 12.1 years, were analysed. The preoperative iHOT-12 score correlated with the postoperative iHOT-12 score at the 2-year follow-up. For one iHOT-12 point positive difference preoperatively, an additional 0.65 points were gained postoperatively at the 2-year follow-up (P ≤ 0.001). Age, gender, symptom duration until surgery, level of cartilage damage and FAI type did not have a statistically significant correlation to the postoperative score. Preoperative hip function as measured by the iHOT-12 is a potential predictor of outcome following FAI surgery relative to other factors.",
