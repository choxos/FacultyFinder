  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Systematic scoping review, focusing on randomized clinical trials of recent research addressing tree nut allergy. RECENT FINDINGS: This review addresses published, unpublished, and re-analyzed studies on tree nut allergy definition, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy. SUMMARY: The importance of tree nut allergy spans nations, economies, and cultures. While broad themes in epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy are emerging, the next major advance in tree nut allergy will require large, robust studies to deliver results important to patients and families.",
