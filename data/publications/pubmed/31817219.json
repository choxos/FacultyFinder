  "title": "Surgical Management of Hepatoblastoma and Recent Advances.",
  "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is the most common childhood liver malignancy. The management of hepatoblastoma requires multidisciplinary efforts. The five-year overall survival is approximately 80% in developed countries. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for hepatoblastoma, and meticulous techniques must be employed to ensure safe and effective local control surgeries. Additionally, there have been several advances from both pediatric and adult literature in the way liver tumor surgery is performed. In this review, we highlight important aspects of liver surgery for hepatoblastoma, the management of metastatic disease, and the most current technical advances in performing these procedures in a safe and effective manner.",
