  "title": "Investigating the Associations Between Child Autistic Symptoms, Socioeconomic Context, and Family Life: A Pilot Study.",
  "abstract": "Objective: The day-to-day experience of families with an Autistic child may be shaped by both, child characteristics and available resources, which often are influenced by the socioeconomic context of the family. Using a socioecological approach, this study explored the quantitative associations between child autistic symptoms, family socioeconomic status, and family life. Methods: Data came from the Pediatric Autism Research Cohort-PARC Study (pilot). Parents of children with a recent diagnosis of autism completed a set of assessments, including the Autism Family Experience Questionnaire, Autism Impact Measure, and a Sociodemographic Questionnaire. A series of multiple, iterative linear regression models were constructed to ascertain quantitative associations between child autistic symptoms, socioeconomic context, and family life. Results: A total of 50 children (mean age: 76 months; SD: 9.5 months; and 84% male) with data on the variables of interest were included in the analysis. The frequency of child autistic symptoms was associated with family life outcomes (p = 0.02 and R [2] = 24%). Once autistic symptom frequency, symptom impact, and sociodemographic variables were considered, parents of higher educational attainment reported worse family life outcomes compared to their lesser-educated counterparts. This cumulative regression model had considerable explanatory capability (p = 0.01, R [2] = 40%). Conclusion: This study demonstrates the utility of using a socioecological approach to examine the dynamic interplay between child characteristics and family circumstances. Our findings suggest that family life for parents (of an autistic child) who have obtained higher education is reported (by the parents themselves) as less satisfactory compared to that of parents without higher education, once adjusted for the autistic symptom frequency of child, symptom impact, and income. These findings can inform the design and delivery of more family-centered care pathways during the years following a diagnosis of autism.",
