  "title": "Social determinants of health and the transition from advanced chronic kidney disease to kidney failure.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The transition from chronic kidney disease (CKD) to kidney failure is a vulnerable time for patients, with suboptimal transitions associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Whether social determinants of health are associated with suboptimal transitions is not well understood. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 1070 patients with advanced CKD who were referred to the Ottawa Hospital Multi-Care Kidney Clinic and developed kidney failure (dialysis or kidney transplantation) between 2010 and 2021. Social determinant information, including education level, employment status and marital status, was collected under routine clinic protocol. Outcomes surrounding suboptimal transition included inpatient (versus outpatient) dialysis starts, pre-emptive (versus delayed) access creation and pre-emptive kidney transplantation. We examined the association between social determinants of health and suboptimal transition outcomes using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: The mean age and estimated glomerular filtration rate were 63 years and 18 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively. Not having a high school degree was associated with higher odds for an inpatient dialysis start compared with having a college degree {odds ratio [OR] 1.71 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-2.69]}. Unemployment was associated with higher odds for an inpatient dialysis start [OR 1.85 (95% CI 1.18-2.92)], lower odds for pre-emptive access creation [OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34-0.82)] and lower odds for pre-emptive kidney transplantation [OR 0.48 (95% CI 0.24-0.96)] compared with active employment. Being single was associated with higher odds for an inpatient dialysis start [OR 1.44 (95% CI 1.07-1.93)] and lower odds for pre-emptive access creation [OR 0.67 (95% CI 0.50-0.89)] compared with being married. CONCLUSIONS: Social determinants of health, including education, employment and marital status, are associated with suboptimal transitions from CKD to kidney failure.",
