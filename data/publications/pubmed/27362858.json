  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pharmacogenetic relationship between CFH haplotypes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with response to ranibizumab treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study involving 70 treatment-naive nAMD patients. Patients were genotyped for CFH haplotypes and SNPs in the C3, ARMS2, and mtDNA genes. Visual acuity and central macular thickness were assessed at baseline and during 6 monthly follow-up visits. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between genotypes and a gain of ≥15 letters at the 6-month endpoint after adjusting for potential confounders. RESULTS: CFH haplotypes were associated with a gain of ≥15 letters at the 6-month endpoint (p = 0.046). Patients expressing protective haplotypes were more likely to achieve a gain of ≥15 letters relative to the greatly increased risk haplotypes [OR 6.58 (95% CI: 1.37, 31.59)]. CONCLUSION: CFH is implicated in nAMD patient treatment response to ranibizumab.",
