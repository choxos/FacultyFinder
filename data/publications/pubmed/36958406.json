  "title": "Editorial: The Importance of Screening for Developmental Disorders and Demonstrating Improved Health Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Screening for emotional, behavioral, and developmental disorders is generally considered to be a valuable activity in the child and youth developmental and mental health service sectors. The premise is that screening allows for early identification, which in turn allows for early intervention, which in turn leads to better long-term outcomes. While the hypothesized causal chain from screening to outcomes may seem long, the evidence base to support this aspiration is growing. In this issue of the Journal, the article by Rah et al.[1] provides an important piece of the puzzle to support screening for developmental disorders in early childhood in particular and has a number of important lessons for the field.",
