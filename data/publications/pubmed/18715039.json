  "abstract": "An efficient stereocontrolled route to the spirocyclic perhydrohistrionicotoxin derivative (+/-)-2,7,8-epi-PHTx (4) is described. The reaction of 2-butyl-3-(methoxymethoxy)cyclohexanone oxime with 2,3-bis(phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-butadiene gives rise to a 7-oxa-1-azanorbornane cycloadduct in high yield. The formation of the bicyclic isoxazolidine arises from conjugate addition of the oxime onto the diene to give a transient nitrone which then undergoes an intramolecular dipolar cycloaddition. Treatment of the cycloadduct with 5% Na/Hg results in reductive nitrogen-oxygen bond cleavage to furnish an azaspiro[5.5]undecane. Elaboration to the dihydropyridin-4(1H)-one 24 was followed by stereoselective conjugate addition using n-pentyl cuprate to give azaspirocycle 25. The stereochemistry of the product was deduced from an X-ray crystal structure of the corresponding N-tosylhydrazone derivative. The dominant factor controlling the stereochemistry of the conjugate addition is the A(1,3)-strain present in the planar vinylogous amide. A stereoelectronically preferred axial attack by the organocuprate at the beta-position leads to the observed diastereoselectivity. Azaspirocycle 25 was transformed into 2,7,8-epi-PHTx (4) in five additional steps. Utilizing this tandem conjugate addition/dipolar cycloaddition cascade, we have also successfully synthesized azaspiro[5.5]undecane 36, which had previously been converted into (+/-)-perhydrohistrionicotoxin (2), thereby completing a formal total synthesis of this alkaloid.",
