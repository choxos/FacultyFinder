  "title": "Anatomical variations of the carpal tunnel structures.",
  "abstract": "There are many anatomical variations in and around the carpal tunnel that affect the nerves, tendons and arteries in this area. Awareness of these variations is important both during the clinical examination and during carpal tunnel release. The purpose of the present review is to highlight recognized anatomical variations within the carpal tunnel including variation in nerve anatomy, tendon anatomical variants, vascular anatomical variations and muscle anatomical variations.",
