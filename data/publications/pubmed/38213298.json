  "title": "Is It Time to Incorporate Liquid Biopsy into High-Risk Cancer Surveillance Protocols in Li-Fraumeni Syndrome?",
  "abstract": "In the first prospective study evaluating circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for early cancer detection, Wong, Luo, and colleauges demonstrate the feasibility of liquid biopsy as an augmentation to current surveillance protocols for patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, an inherited cancer predisposition associated with high cancer risk in both pediatric and adult populations. Though additional clinical validation in larger cohorts is needed, this research highlights that a multimodal approach is likely necessary to improve the sensitivity of liquid biopsy assays for early cancer detection. See related article by Wong, Lou et al., p. 104 (9).",
