  "abstract": "There is growing consensus for upskilling the health care workforce on gender-responsive strategies to more effectively connect and respond to men during health care encounters. To inform health practitioner education, the primary aim of this study was to gain insights from a diverse sample of men in Australia on their experiences and expectations when engaging with health care practitioners. Thirty-two men (18-70 years, median 33) participated in eight online focus group discussions. A combined deductive and inductive thematic analysis was undertaken to reconcile their expectations with prior published approaches for practitioners to engage men in care and identify new themes. Participants desired a genuine relationship, signaled by upfront and informal communication, active listening, and enquiry. In structuring treatment, participants sought transparency and respect for autonomy. Regarding the therapeutic alliance, avoiding gender stereotyping and empathetic, sensitive, and holistic care were valued by men. These expectations for how practitioners engage with men in care were reflected in their advice for health practitioner student training and aligned with approaches published previously. Participant insights were synthesized into four outcomes, for men, of successful engagement: legitimize the relationship to build trust, create a safe space to facilitate disclosure, empower men, and assess and treat the whole man through a biopsychosocial lens. In conclusion, men seek authentic connection and a caring style that allows them to legitimize and forge an ongoing relationship with their practitioner. These outcomes of successful engagement are key to developing consumer-informed health practitioner education and competencies on gender-responsive health care for men.",
