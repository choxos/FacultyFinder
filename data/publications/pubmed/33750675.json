  "abstract": "We reported a case of a 32 years old male presenting with a perforating gunshot injury in craniocerebral region 3 h after the assault. The bullet entered above the right zygomatic arch, travelling through the coronal plane, and exited from the left zygomatic arch. The patient was fully conscious at presentation and developed facial nerve palsy during his hospital stay. Non-contrast CT scan of the head revealed fractures of the right orbit, bilateral maxilla, bilateral pterygoid plates, ethmoid air cells, vomer and left zygoma, and without any cerebral damage. He was treated conservatively and the facial palsy was resolved. The patient survived without any complications. Such case has not been described in the available literature till date.",
