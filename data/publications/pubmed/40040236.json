  "title": "Additional Bioactive Silvestrol Analogs from the Roots of Aglaia perviridis Collected in Vietnam.",
  "abstract": "The tropical plant Aglaia perviridis is known to produce cyclopenta[b]benzofuran and other types of rocaglate derivatives including silvestrol (3) and 5â€´-episilvestrol (4) that are of current pharmacological interest. In the present work, further investigation of A. perviridis roots collected in Vietnam has yielded two new rocaglate acetonide derivatives (1 and 2) and a known pentanor-3,4-seco-dammarane triterpenoid (7) found for the first time as a natural product, in addition to four known rocaglates (3-6). The structures of compounds 1 and 2 were confirmed by partial synthesis experiments, and their potential occurrence as extraction artifacts was investigated by targeted selective ion monitoring using UHPLC-MS. All compounds obtained were evaluated against a panel of four human cancer cell lines, in which the six rocaglate derivatives (1-6) tested all showed submicromolar potencies.",
