  "title": "Role of zolpidem in the management of insomnia.",
  "abstract": "Insomnia is a common condition that affects one's ability to sleep comfortably and consequently to work effectively. Its etiology is multifactorial and involves plethora of risk factors. Consequences can vary from mild sleepiness to more sever psychiatric disturbances and ischemic stroke. Despite several diagnostic criteria it is poorly diagnosed and less often treated. Benzodiazepines formed the mainline therapy for many years till the advent of newer nonbenzodiazepine group of drugs including zolpidem. Zolpidem is an imidazo-pyridine compound that enhances the GABA(A) receptor function by interaction with Omega-1 receptor subtype. Its pharmacokinetic profile allows the patients to use it later in the night when having trouble falling asleep without any residual cognitive impairment the next morning. It has rapid onset of action, improves total sleep duration, and reduces night-time awakenings. Its adverse effect profile is satisfactory as it appears to have low addiction potential. This review will focus on the current role of zolpidem in the management of insomnia.",
