  "title": "LuCl3/B(C6F5)3 Cocatalyzed Reductive Deoxygenation of Ketones, Aldehydes, Alcohols, and Ethers to Alkanes with Pinacolborane.",
  "abstract": "This report describes the LuCl3/B(C6F5)3 cocatalyzed reductive deoxygenation of 67 ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, and ethers to alkanes under mild conditions. The strategy tolerates reactive amino, hydroxyl, nitro, halogen, vinyl, and ester functional groups, and the results demonstrate rare chemoselective deoxygenation of α,β-unsaturated ketones. Isotopic labeling experiments, control experiments, and derivatization studies are used to elucidate the reaction mechanism.",
