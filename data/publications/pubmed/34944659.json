  "title": "Current Overview on Therapeutic Potential of Vitamin D in Inflammatory Lung Diseases.",
  "abstract": "Inflammatory lung disorders (ILDs) are one of the world's major reasons for fatalities and sickness, impacting millions of individuals of all ages and constituting a severe and pervasive health hazard. Asthma, lung cancer, bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COPD all include inflammation as a significant component. Microbe invasions, as well as the damage and even death of host cells, can cause and sustain inflammation. To counteract the negative consequences of irritants, the airways are equipped with cellular and host defense immunological systems that block the cellular entrance of these irritants or eliminate them from airway regions by triggering the immune system. Failure to activate the host defense system will trigger chronic inflammatory cataracts, leading to permanent lung damage. This damage makes the lungs more susceptible to various respiratory diseases. There are certain restrictions of the available therapy for lung illnesses. Vitamins are nutritional molecules that are required for optimal health but are not produced by the human body. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D) is classified as a vitamin, although it is a hormone. Vitamin D is thought to perform a function in bone and calcium homeostasis. Recent research has found that vitamin D can perform a variety of cellular processes, including cellular proliferation; differentiation; wound repair; healing; and regulatory systems, such as the immune response, immunological, and inflammation. The actions of vitamin D on inflammatory cells are dissected in this review, as well as their clinical significance in respiratory illnesses.",
