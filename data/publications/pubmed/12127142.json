  "title": "Expression of SNAP-25 during mammalian retinal development: thinking outside the synapse.",
  "abstract": "The SNARE complex is the core machinery required for vesicle fusion events. Numerous structural, functional, and genetic studies have led to a better understanding of mechanisms that regulate vesicle fusion events during neural development. Studies using the mammalian retina as a model system have increased our understanding of the dynamic patterns of expression of SNARE proteins. In particular, the SNARE complex protein SNAP-25 is expressed in a dynamic fashion during the development of cholinergic amacrine cells in a number of mammalian species. SNAP-25 is also likely to play a crucial role during the development of vertebrate photoreceptors. The integration of comparative studies examining SNARE proteins, such as SNAP-25, provides a powerful approach for the study of CNS development.",
