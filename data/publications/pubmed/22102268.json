  "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a prothrombotic drug reaction caused by platelet-activating antibodies. HIT sera often activate platelets without needing heparin-such heparin-\"independent\" platelet activation can be associated with HIT beginning or worsening despite stopping heparin (\"delayed-onset HIT\"). We address important issues in HIT diagnosis and therapy, using a recent cohort of HIT patients to illustrate influences of heparin type; triggers for HIT investigation; serological features of heparin-independent platelet activation; and treatment. In our cohort of recent HIT cases (N = 13), low-molecular-weight heparin (dalteparin) was a common causative agent (N = 8, 62%); most patients were diagnosed after HIT-thrombosis had occurred; and danaparoid was the most frequently selected treatment. Heparin-independent platelet activation was common (7/13 [54%]) and predicted slower platelet count recovery (>1 week) among evaluable patients (5/5 vs 1/6; P = 0.015). In our experience with argatroban-treated patients, HIT-associated consumptive coagulopathy confounds anticoagulant monitoring. Our observations provide guidance on practical aspects of HIT diagnosis and management.",
