  "title": "Clostridioides difficile infection in mechanically ventilated critically ill patients: A nested cohort study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a serious complication of critical illness. The objective of the study was to determine its incidence, prevalence, timing, severity, predictors, and outcomes. METHODS: We performed a prospective nested cohort study of CDI within a randomized trial comparing Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to placebo. We adjudicated cases of CDI using standardized definitions, assessed timing (pre-ICU, in ICU, post-ICU) and severity. We analyzed risk factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2650 patients, 86 were diagnosed with CDI during 90,833 hospital-days (0.95/1000 hospital-days); CDI prevalence was 3.2%. CDI incidence varied in timing; 0.3% patients had CDI pre-ICU, 2.2% in the ICU; an 0.8% developed CDI post-ICU. Relapse or recurrence of CDI was documented in 9.3% patients. Infections were mild/moderate in severity. Complications included septic shock (26.7%), organ failure (16.3%), and toxic megacolon requiring colectomy (1.2%). No risk factors for CDI were identified. CDI was not associated with hospital mortality. The duration of hospital stay was longer for those who had CDI compared those who did not, CONCLUSION: CDI was uncommon, severity was mild to moderate and not associated with mortality however CDI was associated with a longer hospital stay.",
