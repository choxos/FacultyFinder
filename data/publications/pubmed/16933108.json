  "abstract": "This article aims at discussing the six papers included in this special issue on innovations in Problem-based learning (PBL). The papers address different aspects related to the implementation and the development of PBL. This discussion article highlights the relevance of the theme explored by each of the papers, the contributions emerging from the study to what is already known about that topic, and its limitations, particularly those that suggest directions for future research. Emphasis is given to new insights brought by the papers for better understanding tutorial group processes and self-study phase in PBL. The contributions provided by the papers are discussed in the light of pertinent literature and also in relation to their companion articles in this issue when indicated.",
