  "title": "Development of end stage renal disease following an acute cardiac event.",
  "abstract": "We determined the rate and risk factors for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in consecutive patients discharged after a cardiac event in a large, unbiased Canadian cohort that receives universal health coverage. A total of 8236 adults hospitalized over a 2 year period were followed for up to 7.5 years and the incidence of ESRD and mortality determined. Of these, 113 reached ESRD (stage 5). Patients with moderate (stage 3) and severe (stage 4) renal insufficiency were more likely to develop ESRD than those patients at stage 1 or 2. However, patients with moderate renal insufficiency were 78.6 times more likely to die than to develop ESRD. Absolute rates of progression to ESRD per 100-patient years were 0.08 at stages 1 and 2, 0.17 at stage 3 and 4.27 at stage 4. Age, diabetes, hypertension and congestive heart failure also predicted ESRD. We found that patients with stage 4 disease are at high risk of ESRD after a cardiac admission while those at stage 3 are far more likely to die than to develop ESRD.",
