  "title": "G9a controls placental vascular maturation by activating the Notch Pathway.",
  "abstract": "Defective fetoplacental vascular maturation causes intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). A transcriptional switch initiates placental maturation, during which blood vessels elongate. However, the cellular mechanisms and regulatory pathways involved are unknown. We show that the histone methyltransferase G9a, also known as Ehmt2, activates the Notch pathway to promote placental vascular maturation. Placental vasculature from embryos with G9a-deficient endothelial progenitor cells failed to expand owing to decreased endothelial cell proliferation and increased trophoblast proliferation. Moreover, G9a deficiency altered the transcriptional switch initiating placental maturation and caused downregulation of Notch pathway effectors including Rbpj Importantly, Notch pathway activation in G9a-deficient endothelial progenitors extended embryonic life and rescued placental vascular expansion. Thus, G9a activates the Notch pathway to balance endothelial cell and trophoblast proliferation and coordinates the transcriptional switch controlling placental vascular maturation. Accordingly, G9A and RBPJ were downregulated in human placentae from IUGR-affected pregnancies, suggesting that G9a is an important regulator in placental diseases caused by defective vascular maturation.",
