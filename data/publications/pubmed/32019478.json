  "title": "Neoleukin-2 enhances anti-tumour immunity downstream of peptide vaccination targeted by an anti-MHC class II VHH.",
  "abstract": "Cancer-specific mutations can lead to peptides of unique sequence presented on MHC class I to CD8 T cells. These neoantigens can be potent tumour-rejection antigens, appear to be the driving force behind responsiveness to anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD1/L1-based therapies and have been used to develop personalized vaccines. The platform for delivering neoantigen-based vaccines has varied, and further optimization of both platform and adjuvant will be necessary to achieve scalable vaccine products that are therapeutically effective at a reasonable cost. Here, we developed a platform for testing potential CD8 T cell tumour vaccine candidates. We used a high-affinity alpaca-derived VHH against MHC class II to deliver peptides to professional antigen-presenting cells. We show in vitro and in vivo that peptides derived from the model antigen ovalbumin are better able to activate naive ovalbumin-specific CD8 T cells when conjugated to an MHC class II-specific VHH when compared with an irrelevant control VHH. We then used the VHH-peptide platform to evaluate a panel of candidate neoantigens in vivo in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. None of the candidate neoantigens tested led to protection from tumour challenge; however, we were able to show vaccine-induced CD8 T cell responses to a melanoma self-antigen that was augmented by combination therapy with the synthetic cytokine mimetic Neo2/15.",
