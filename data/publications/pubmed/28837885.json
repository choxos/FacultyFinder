  "abstract": "AIMS: To quantify whether insulin therapy, and concomitant weight gain, affects recreational physical activity and TV viewing time using data from the Outcomes Reduction with an Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial. METHODS: 12,537 insulin-na√Øve individuals with dysglycaemia were randomised to receive either basal insulin glargine or standard care and followed for a median of 6.2years. Complete recreational physical activity and TV viewing time questionnaires across baseline, 2year follow-up and study end were available for 8954 participants. Differences between groups at follow-up were assessed by analysis of covariance. RESULTS: At follow-up, there was no difference in physical activity or TV viewing time between those taking insulin glargine and those receiving standard care, despite body weight increasing by 1.66 (7.56) kg in the insulin glargine group and reducing by -0.65 (7.90) kg in the standard care group (P<0.001). The dose of insulin glargine was not associated with changes in physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest weight gain, insulin glargine did not adversely impact recreational physical activity levels within an international cohort with dysglyaemia.
