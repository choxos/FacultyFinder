  "title": "COVID-19-positive cancer patients undergoing active anticancer treatment: An analysis of clinical features and outcomes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer patients, particularly those on active anticancer treatment, are reportedly at a high risk of severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and death. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients diagnosed with COVID-19 whilst on anticancer treatment in a developing country. METHODS: This is a retrospective observational study of all adult cancer patients at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, Pakistan, from March 15, 2020 to July 10, 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 within 4 weeks of receiving anticancer treatment, where a purposive sampling was performed. Cancer patients who did not receive anticancer treatment and clinical or radiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were excluded. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality after 30 days of COVID-19 test. Data was analyzed with SPSS version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Categorical parameters were computed using chi-square test, keeping p value < 0.05 as significant. RESULTS: A total of 201 cancer patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. The median age of patients was 45 (18-78) years. Mild symptoms were present in 162 (80.6%) patients, whereas severe symptoms were present in 39 (19.4%) patients. The risk of death was statistically significant (p < .05) amongst patients with age greater than 50 years, metastatic disease, and ongoing palliative anticancer treatment. Anticancer treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery) received within preceding 4 weeks had no statistically significant (p > .05) impact on mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In cancer patients with COVID-19, mortality appears to be principally driven by age, advanced stage of the disease, and palliative intent of cancer treatment. We did not identify evidence that cancer patients on chemotherapy are at significant risk of mortality from COVID-19 correlating to those not on chemotherapy.",
