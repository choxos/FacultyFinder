  "title": "Angiosarcoma of the Pancreas in a Pediatric Patient With an Activating KDR-Internal Tandem Duplication: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.",
  "abstract": "Pancreatic angiosarcoma is an exceedingly rare malignancy accounting for <1% of pancreatic neoplasms. A very limited number of pancreatic angiosarcomas have been reported in the literature without any cases described in children. We present the case of a 17-year-old female diagnosed with angiosarcoma of the pancreas following pancreaticoduodenectomy for a pancreatic mass, initially presumed to be a solid pseudopapillary neoplasm of the pancreas. The angiosarcoma was found to have a novel activating internal tandem duplication in the KDR gene (KDR-internal tandem duplication). We discuss the current literature on this disease process. This is the first reported case of pancreatic angiosarcoma in a pediatric patient and the first with an activating KDR-internal tandem duplication.",
