  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Total Knee Replacement Surgery (TKR) is one of the most common elective orthopedic operations. Postoperative pain after total knee replacement, remains a challenge. In this retrospective observational study, we evaluated the effectiveness of 3-in-1 nerve block in patients after total knee arthroplasty compared to standard opioid treatment, and we state the reasons why this approach should still be considered. METHODS: To evaluate the effectiveness of the 3-in-1 nerve block, we assessed the acute pain service archive and compared the values of the visual analog scale, by separating patients into two groups according to the analgesic regimen they received as per local protocols. In group A, patients received 0.25% bupivacaine through a 3 in 1 block catheter and additional meperidine IM if needed, while in group B they received meperidine every six hours. RESULTS: Our analysis showed the statistically significant better effectiveness of 3-in-1 nerve block with bupivacaine administration in postoperative TKR pain control compared to repeated administration of meperidine. CONCLUSION: The results of our study suggest that 3-in-1 nerve block with bupivacaine is an option that must always be considered in order to alleviate post-operative pain after TKR.",
