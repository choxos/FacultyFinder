  "abstract": "This chapter conducts an in-depth exploration of the impact of musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders and injuries, with a specific emphasis on their consequences within the older population demographic. It underscores the escalating demand for innovative interventions in MSK tissue engineering. The chapter also highlights the fundamental role played by lipid signaling mediators (LSMs) in tissue regeneration, with relevance to bone and muscle recovery. Remarkably, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) emerges as a central orchestrator in these regenerative processes. Furthermore, the chapter investigates the complex interplay between bone and muscle tissues, explaining the important influence exerted by LSMs on their growth and differentiation. The targeted modulation of LSM pathways holds substantial promise as a beneficial way for addressing muscle disorders. In addition to these conceptual understandings, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of methodologies employed in the identification of LSMs, with a specific focus on the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Furthermore, it introduces a detailed LC MS/MS-based protocol tailored for the detection of PGE2, serving as an invaluable resource for researchers immersed in this dynamic field of study.",
