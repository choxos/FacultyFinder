  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity and a healthy diet are important in helping to maintain mobility with aging. This umbrella review aims to identify group-based physical activity and/or nutrition interventions for community-dwelling older adults that improve mobility-related outcomes. METHODS: Five electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, Sociological Abstracts) were searched from inception to December 2021. Eligibility criteria included systematic reviews exploring the effectiveness of physical activity or structured exercise, alone or combined with nutrition interventions on mobility-related outcomes (aerobic capacity, physical function, balance, falls/safety, muscle strength, health-related quality of life/wellbeing). Interventions must have been delivered in a group setting to community-dwelling older adults aged 55+. Two reviewers independently performed eligibility screening, critical appraisal (using AMSTAR 2) and data extraction. The GRADE approach was used to reflect the certainty of evidence based on the size of the effect within each mobility-related outcome category. Older adult/provider research partners informed data synthesis and results presentation. RESULTS: In total, 62 systematic reviews (1 high, 21 moderate, 40 low/critically low quality) were identified; 53 included physical activity only, and nine included both physical activity and nutritional supplements. No reviews included nutrition interventions alone. Combined aerobic/resistance, general physical activity, and mind-body exercise all improved physical function and balance (moderate-high certainty). Aerobic/resistance training improved aerobic capacity (high certainty). Resistance training and general physical activity improved muscle strength (moderate certainty). Aerobic/resistance training and general physical activity are likely to reduce falls among older adults (moderate certainty). There was no evidence of benefit for nutritional supplementation with physical activity. CONCLUSIONS: Group-based physical activity interventions that combine aerobic and resistance, general PA and mind-body exercise can improve measures of mobility in community-dwelling older adults. We found no reviews focused on nutrition only, highlighting a gap in the literature.",
