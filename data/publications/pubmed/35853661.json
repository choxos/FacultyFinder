  "title": "The burden of cancer among people living with HIV in Ontario, Canada, 1997-2020: a retrospective population-based cohort study using administrative health data.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: With combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) and increased longevity, cancer is a leading cause of morbidity among people with HIV. We characterized trends in cancer burden among people with HIV in Ontario, Canada, between 1997 and 2020. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, retrospective cohort study of adults with HIV using linked administrative health databases from Jan. 1, 1997, to Nov. 1, 2020. We grouped cancers as infection-related AIDS-defining cancers (ADCs), infection-related non-ADCs (NADCs) and infection-unrelated cancers. We calculated age-standardized incidence rates per 100 000 person-years with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using direct standardization, stratified by calendar period and sex. We also calculated limited-duration prevalence. RESULTS: Among 19 403 adults living with HIV (79% males), 1275 incident cancers were diagnosed. From 1997-2000 to 2016- 2020, we saw a decrease in the incidence of all cancers (1113.9 [95% CI 657.7-1765.6] to 683.5 [95% CI 613.4-759.4] per 100 000 person-years), ADCs (403.1 [95% CI 194.2-739.0] to 103.8 [95% CI 79.2-133.6] per 100 000 person-years) and infection-related NADCs (196.6 [95% CI 37.9-591.9] to 121.9 [95% CI 94.3-154.9] per 100 000 person-years). The incidence of infection-unrelated cancers was stable at 451.0 per 100 000 person-years (95% CI 410.3-494.7). The incidence of cancer among females increased over time but was similar to that of males in 2016-2020. INTERPRETATION: Over a 24-year period, the incidence of cancer decreased overall, largely driven by a considerable decrease in the incidence of ADC, whereas the incidence of infection-unrelated cancer remained unchanged and contributed to the greatest burden of cancer. These findings could reflect combination ART-mediated changes in infectious comorbidity and increased life expectancy; targeted cancer screening and prevention strategies are needed.",
