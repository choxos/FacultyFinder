  "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory condition predominantly affecting younger adults and disproportionately affecting women and Black Americans. Estimated prevalences vary significantly according to study methodology; however, true prevalence may range from approximately 0.1% to 1%. Hidradenitis suppurativa is associated with a number of comorbid conditions which also contribute to poor health outcomes and negative impact on quality of life. Recent advancements in our understanding of disease burden in hidradenitis suppurativa have allowed us to identify subgroups of the population afflicted with the disease and to implement strategies which facilitate comprehensive care.",
