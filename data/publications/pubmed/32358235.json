  "title": "The Role of Postoperative Bandage Contact Lens in Patients Undergoing Fasanella-Servat Ptosis Repair.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether a bandage contact lens (BCL) improves patient comfort in the postoperative period in patients undergoing ptosis repair using the Fasanella-Servat technique, compared with no BCL. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, double-masked, comparison study, all patients had bilateral Fasanella-Servat surgery. A total of 30 patients were randomized to receive a BCL in one eye and no BCL in the other eye. Patient discomfort was measured as the primary outcome using the Eye Sensation Scale. Blurred vision was measured as a secondary outcome using selected questions from the Ocular Surface Disease Index. The surgeries were performed by 2 surgeons (J.T.H and R.S.A). Outcomes were measured one week following the procedure. RESULTS: Patients reported significantly less discomfort in the eye receiving a BCL, with only 13.3% ranking discomfort as \"moderate\" or \"severe,\" compared with the eye not receiving BCL, where 63.3% of patients rated discomfort as \"moderate\" or \"severe\" (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in patient-reported blurred vision between the 2 groups (p = 0.520). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a bandage contact lens after Fasanella-Servat procedure for ptosis repair is recommended as it improves patient comfort. In addition, it has no detrimental effect on patient-reported blurring of vision.",
