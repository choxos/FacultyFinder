  "abstract": "Emergency physicians often need point-of-care access to current, valid information to guide patient management. Most emergency physicians do not work in a hospital with a computerized decision support system that prompts and provides them with information to answer their clinical questions. Searching for answers to clinical questions online, especially those related to diagnosis and treatment, can be challenging, in part because determining the validity and clinical applicability of the results of individual studies is beyond the time constraints of most emergency physicians. This article describes currently available point-of-care sources of evidence-based information to answer clinical questions and provides the access information for each.",
