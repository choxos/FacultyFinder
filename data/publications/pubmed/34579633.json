  "title": "Pharmacological Efficacy and Safety of Glycyrrhiza glabra in the Treatment of Respiratory Tract Infections.",
  "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections are underestimated because they are mild and disabling, but in clinical medicine, these are the most prevalent problems. According to the World Health Organization third-most comprehensive cause of death in the world till 2030 would be Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dominating viruses of respiratory infections are influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, and human coronaviruses. Antibiotics are mostly used to treat bacterial infections, and they do not effectively manage viral infections like sinusitis, sore throats, bronchitis, influenza, and common respiratory infections. Presently no medication is available only symptomatic interventions is an option in our hand. However, a lot of research is going on the vaccine and drugs-based approaches against respiratory viruses worldwide. Traditional medicines are getting the attraction to treat many diseases. It is vital to screen the medicinal plants to find the potential of new compounds for treatment against antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Glycyrrhiza glabra L. (Licorice) pharmacological actions modulate the immune system, inhibit virus growth, produce anti-inflammatory activity, and inactivate viruses. This comprehensive review mainly focuses on the role of licorice in managing respiratory infections caused by viruses and bacteria, including complications associated with its excess intake. There has been limited human research's exhibited licorice effectiveness in respiratory infections; therefore, there is a need for uncompromising and long-term research. This paper will be a valuable reference for biologists and physicians looking for a medication for respiratory infections. Glycyrrhiza glabra could open the door to novel agents in drug discovery and development.",
