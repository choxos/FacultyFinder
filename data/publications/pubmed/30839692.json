  "abstract": "Targeting fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) migration and invasion-mediated bone erosion is a promising clinical strategy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Drug sensitivity testing is fundamental to this scheme. We designed a microfluidic chip-based, cell co-cultured platform to mimic RA FLS-mediated bone erosion and perform drug-sensitive assay. Human synovium SW982 cells were cultured in the central channel and migrated to flow through matrigel-coated side channels towards cell culture chamber where RANKL-stimulated osteoclastic RAW264.7 and osteogenic medium (OS)-stimulated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) were cultured in the microfluidic chip device, mimicking FLS migration and invasion-mediated bone erosion in RA. These SW982 cells showed different migration potentials to osteoclasts and BMSC. The migration of SW982 cells with high expression of cadherin-11 was more potent when SW982 cells were connected with the co-culture of RAW264.7 and BMSC. Simultaneously, in the co-cultured chamber, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells was enhanced, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was decreased in comparison with mono-cultured chamber. Furthermore, it was confirmed that celastrol, a positive drug for the treatment of RA, inhibited SW982 cell migration as well as TRAP activity in the cell-cultured microfluidic chips. Thus, the migration and invasion to bone-related cells was reconstituted on the microfluidic model. It may provide an effective anti-RA drug screen model for targeting FLS migration-mediated bone erosion.",
