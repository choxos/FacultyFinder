  "title": "Assessing impact of MALDI mass spectroscopy on reducing directed antibiotic coverage time for Gram-negative organisms.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess whether use of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF), through improvements in identification time, reduces time to directed antibiotic coverage. We therefore conducted a retrospective review of 377 blood cultures from hospitalized patients with gram negative bacteremia that underwent testing by MALDI-TOF compared to standard identification methods (VITEK 2) for blood cultures from January 2016 to December 2017. We found that MALDI significantly reduced time between blood culture collection to reach pathogen identification and was associated with a significantly reduced time to initiate more specific therapy, with a mean difference of 16.37 hours, 95% CI 10.05 to 22.69 (mean time 50.34 hours (+/- 21.21) vs VITEK: 66.71 hrs (+/- 27.12), p<0.001 as well as a reduced time to discontinue previous therapy (p = 0.004). In conclusion, in reducing time to identification of gram negative bacteremia, MALDI-TOF led to improvements in antibiotic coverage.",
