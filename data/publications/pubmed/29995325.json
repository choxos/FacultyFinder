  "title": "Genetic inactivation of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP-25) in adult hippocampal neural progenitors impairs pattern discrimination learning but not survival or structural maturation of newborn dentate granule cells.",
  "abstract": "Adult neurogenesis is necessary for proper cognition and behavior, however, the mechanisms that underlie the integration and maturation of newborn neurons into the pre-existing hippocampal circuit are not entirely known. In this study, we sought to determine the role of action potential (AP)-dependent synaptic transmission by adult-generated dentate granule cells (DGCs) in their survival and function within the existing circuitry. We used a triple transgenic mouse (NestinCreER[T2] :Snap25[fl/fl] : tdTomato) to inducibly inactivate AP-dependent synaptic transmission within adult hippocampal progenitors and their progeny. Behavioral testing in a hippocampal-dependent A/B contextual fear-discrimination task revealed impaired discrimination learning in mice harboring SNAP-25-deficient adult-generated dentate granule cells (DGCs). Despite poor performance on this neurogenesis-dependent task, the production and survival of newborn DGCs was quantitatively unaltered in tamoxifen-treated NestinCreER[T2] :Snap25[fl/fl] : tdTomato SNAP compared to tamoxifen-treated NestinCreER[T2] :Snap25[wt/wt] : tdTomato control mice. Although SNAP-25-deficient adult DGCs displayed a small but statistically significant enhancement in proximal dendritic branching, their overall dendritic length and distal branching complexity was unchanged. SNAP-25-deficient newborn DGCs also displayed robust efferent mossy fiber output to CA3, with normal linear density of large mossy fiber terminals (LMTs). These studies suggest that AP-dependent neurotransmitter release by newborn DGCs is not essential for their survival or rudimentary structural maturation within the adult hippocampus.",
