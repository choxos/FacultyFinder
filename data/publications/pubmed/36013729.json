  "abstract": "Describing the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) behaviors and grain evolution mechanisms in the hot forming process contributes to controlling microstructures and enhancing mechanical properties of materials. Here, the isothermal compression experiments for SAE 5137H steel were conducted under temperatures of 1123-1483 K and strain rates of 0.01-10 s[-1]. The DRX kinetics models, including DRX volume fraction and grain size models, and the meso-scale cellular automaton (CA) models, were established based on the obtained true stress-strain curves and microstructure observation results. In order to dynamically reveal DRX behaviors and grain morphology evolution, a multi-field and multi-scale coupling finite element (FE) model for the hot compression process was developed by embedding the solved DRX kinetics models and CA models. Results show that the DRX volume fraction and grain size increase with temperature increasing and strain rate decreasing. The DRX grains are easier to nucleate at the initial grain boundaries. As strain increases, DRX grains grow up by devouring the matrix grains until DRX occurs completely. The microstructures after compression are composed of equiaxed DRX grains. Finally, the comparisons of grain size between experimental results and simulation results were performed. The mean relative errors between experimental results and predicted results from DRX kinetics models, and between experimental results and predicted results from CA models, were evaluated as 6.5% and 6.0%, respectively. It proves that the developed FE model can well describe the microstructure evolution in the hot deformation process of SAE 5137H steel.",
