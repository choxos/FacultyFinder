  "abstract": "Computer activities have commonly been linked to the development of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) in the upper limbs. However, to understand the effects computer use has on such disorders, it is necessary to identify and classify the movements involved in performing common computer tasks, one of these being typing. Motion analysis techniques were adopted to determine the movements involved during a typing task. This involved markers being placed on the knuckles, wrists and forearms of participants. This marker configuration allowed for the flexion, extension, radial deviation, ulnar deviation and a combination of these movements to be calculated. The results in one plane of motion show a mean extension|flexion and radial|ulnar deviation of 18.825° ± 10.013° and 5.228° ± 11.703° respectively. The most common position in two planes of motion was 20° extension with a simultaneous 20° ulnar deviation (10.72%). The results depict an alternative method of categorizing wrist positions in two planes during computer use. Coincident wrist postures should be addressed as opposed to motion in a single plane as these postures may result in different ergonomic risk factors developing.",
