  "title": "GReek Anaesthesiologists's Burnout EPidemic within the COVID-19 pandemic (GRABEP study); a multicenter study on burn out prevalence among Greek anesthesiologists and association with personality traits.",
  "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an unprecedented crisis with extreme distress for the frontline physicians and increased risk of developing burnout. Burnout has a negative impact on patients and physicians, posing a substantial risk in patient safety, quality of care and physicians' overall wellbeing. We evaluated burnout prevalence and possible predisposing factors among anaesthesiologists in the COVID-19 referral university/tertiary hospitals in Greece. In this multicenter, cross-sectional study we have included anaesthesiologists, involved in the care of patients with COVID-19, during the fourth peak of the pandemic (11/2021), in the 7 referral hospitals in Greece. The validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) were used. The response rate was 98% (116/118). More than half of the respondents were females (67.83%, median age 46 years). The overall Cronbach's alpha for MBI and EPQ was 0.894 and 0.877, respectively. The majority (67.24%) of anaesthesiologists were assessed as \"high risk for burnout\" and 21.55% were diagnosed with burnout syndrome. Almost half participants experienced high levels of all three dimensions of burnout; high emotional exhaustion (46.09%), high depersonalization (49.57%) and high levels of low personal accomplishment (43.49%). Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that neuroticism was an independent factor predicting \"high risk for burnout\" as well as burnout syndrome, whereas the \"Lie scale\" of EPQ exhibited a protective effect against burnout. Burnout prevalence in Greek anaesthesiologists working in COVID-19 referral hospitals during the fourth peak of the pandemic was high. Neuroticism was predictive of both \"high risk for burnout\" and \"burnout syndrome\".",
