  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess our surgeons perceptive regarding the safe usage of electrosurgical devices. METHOD: ology: This cross sectional survey was carried out at two hospitals, A cancer hospital and a public sector general hospital. Consultants, fellows and senior residents (Resident year 3rd and year 4th) on the surgical floor were requested to fill up the questionnaire. Calculations were performed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 20) for Windows version 20 statistical software. Data was described using median with minimum and maximum value for quantitative variables. For categorical variables, number of observations and percentages were reported. The study is complied with hospital guidelines on research involving human subjects. RESULTS: Out of 80 questionnaires 52 were filled and returned. 12 consultants, 16 fellows/Senior registrars and 24 senior residents filled their questionnaires. For the sake of anonymity no information was obtained regarding the level of training and experience. Total 12 questions were asked. An expert level was set for a score above 10/12. A moderate level was set at 8/12. A score of less than 8 was considered unsafe for using electrosurgical devices. Only 6 (11.5%) participants had an expert level of understanding. 16 (30.7%) had moderate understanding. 30 (57.7%) were considered unsafe regarding use of electrosurgical devices. 85% participants were not aware of the correct mode of current to use for coagulating vessels. 69% of surgeons would use electrocautery to control staple line bleeds. 67% participants weren't aware of the correct placement of dispersive electrode. 60% couldn't identify a safe device for use in patients with a pacemaker. 46% of surgeons would cut a dispersive electrode to fit it on a child. 69% believed that harmonic scalpel was a bipolar cautery. 61% couldn't differentiate between RFA and Microwave Ablation. 63% didn't know how to handle an operating room fire. CONCLUSION: In these two hospitals, high level of ignorance noticed regarding the procedure and indications of basic electrosurgical equipment which needs raising awareness and further training.",
