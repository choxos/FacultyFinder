  "title": "Short Durations of Radial Hemostatic Device After Diagnostic Transradial Cardiac Catheterization: The PRACTICAL-2 Randomized Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Radial artery occlusion (RAO) is the most common complication following transradial approach (TRA) for cardiac catheterisation. Our aim was to assess if decreasing radial hemostatic device (RHD) time reduces the risk of RAO among individuals receiving small sheath sizes with no adjunctive heparin. METHODS: We randomised 450 individuals undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization via TRA to 3 durations of RHD time: 10, 20, or 30 minutes. After these time periods, the RHD was gradually released over 20 minutes. The primary efficacy end point was forearm hematoma grade ≥ 2 (5-10 cm) and the primary safety end point was RAO (as determined by Doppler ultrasound) 1 hour after RHD removal (before discharge). RESULTS: The mean age was 66 years and 64% were male. Five-French sheaths were used in all patients. Hematoma grade ≥ 2 occurred in only 1 patient, who was in the 20-minute group (P = 0.39). RAO occurred in 6.7% of patients in the 10-minute group, 10.7% in the 20-minute group and 6% in the 30-minute group (P = 0.26). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients receiving small-caliber sheaths without adjunctive heparin, the incidence of forearm hematoma and RAO are low. Shorter durations of RHD time did not further reduce the risk of these complications.",
