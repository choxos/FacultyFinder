  "abstract": "The focus of this article is the palliative treatment of a variety of dysphonic conditions. Symptomatic relief of hoarseness can be achieved by voice therapy, augmentative alternative communication modalities, and surgery. The causes of dysphonia addressed herein include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, head and neck cancers requiring glossectomy or laryngectomy, unilateral vocal fold paralysis, and presbyphonia. Palliative treatment of dysphonia and voice disorders provides symptomatic relief but not a cure of the underlying disease state. For these patients there are a number of palliative interventions that can greatly improve their quality of life.",
