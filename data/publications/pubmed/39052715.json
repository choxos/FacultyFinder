  "title": "Minimal Impact on the Resistome of Children in Botswana After Azithromycin Treatment for Acute Severe Diarrheal Disease.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, can reduce under 5 years of age mortality rates and treat various infections in children in sub-Saharan Africa. These exposures, however, can select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the gut microbiota. METHODS: Our previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a rapid-test-and-treat strategy for severe acute diarrheal disease in children in Botswana included an intervention (3-day azithromycin dose) group and a control group that received supportive treatment. In this prospective matched cohort study using stools collected at baseline and 60 days after treatment from RCT participants, the collection of antibiotic resistance genes or resistome was compared between groups. RESULTS: Certain macrolide resistance genes increased in prevalence by 13%-55% at 60 days, without differences in gene presence between the intervention and control groups. These genes were linked to tetracycline resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. CONCLUSIONS: Azithromycin treatment for bacterial diarrhea for young children in Botswana resulted in similar effects on the gut resistome as the supportive treatment and did not provide additional selective pressure for macrolide resistance gene maintenance. The gut microbiota of these children contains diverse macrolide resistance genes that may be transferred within the gut upon repeated exposures to azithromycin or coselected by other antibiotics.
