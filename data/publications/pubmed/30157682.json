  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate short-term respiratory outcomes, mortality and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants born to mothers with and without pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH).Methods: Exposed infants <33 weeks' gestation were matched to controls in a 1:2 ratio, based on gestation, sex and antenatal steroid exposure in this retrospective cohort study. Primary outcomes were a novel cumulative respiratory index (cRI) (product of mean airway pressure-hours and FiO2-hours while on invasive ventilation during first 72 hours), mortality and BPD.Results: Seventy-nine exposed infants were matched with 158 controls. cRI was higher in exposed infants (median 1854; IQR 186-13,901) versus controls (median 1359; IQR 210-11,302) but not statistically significant (p = .63). On conditional regression analysis, PIH did not predict cRI (adjusted Î² = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.79-1.17; p = .712). No association between PIH and mortality (unadjusted odds ratio [OR] = 3.14; 95% CI = 0.76-13.0; p=.11) was identified. PIH was significantly associated with BPD on univariate analysis (OR = 2.29; 95% CI = 1.02-5.17; p=.046), but not after adjustment (aOR = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.38-4.19; p=.7).Conclusions: PIH was not associated with cRI, mortality or BPD in this study. Further validation of cRI and exploration of its relationship with PIH as well as neonatal outcomes is warranted.",
