  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In this study, a new immunoassay for the simultaneous determination of pepsinogen I (PGI) and pepsinogen II (PGII) in serum based on element labeling strategy coupled with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) detection was proposed. METHODS: The sandwich-type immunoassay was used to simultaneously detect PGI and PGII in serum. PGI and PGII were captured by anti-PGI and anti-PGII antibody immobilized on the magnetic beads and then banded with Eu[3+] labeled anti-PGI detection antibody and Sm[3+] labeled anti-PGII detection antibody, followed by ICP-MS detection. RESULTS: The linear correlation coefficient (R[2]) of PGI and PGII standard curves was .9938 and .9911, with the dynamic range of 0-200 ng/mL and 0-60 ng/mL, respectively. The limit of detection for PGI and PGII was 1.8 ng/mL and 0.3 ng/mL, respectively. The average recovery was 101.41% ± 6.74% for PGI and 101.47% ± 4.20% for PGII. Good correlations were obtained between the proposed method and CLIA (r = .9588 for PGI, r = .9853 for PGII). CONCLUSIONS: We established a mass spectrometry-based immunoassay for the simultaneous detection of PGI and PGII in a single analysis. The element tagged immunoassay coupled with ICP-MS detection has high sensitivity, accuracy, and specificity in clinical serum sample analysis.",
