  "title": "Nurturing Meaningful Intergenerational Social Engagements to Support Healthy Brain Aging for Anishinaabe Older Adults.",
  "abstract": "The emergence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) in Indigenous populations across Canada is of rising concern, as prevalence rates continue to exceed those of non-Indigenous populations. The Intergenerativity Model, guided by Indigenous Ways of Knowing, nurtures a psychosocial approach to promoting healthy brain aging and quality of life. Community-based participatory action methods led by interviews, focus groups, and program observations aid in identifying the barriers to and facilitators of success for intergenerational social engagements in the Anishinaabe community of Wiikwemkoong in northwestern Ontario. A qualitative thematic analysis guides future recommendations for programming opportunities that foster traditional roles of older First Nation adults and support intergenerational relationships. The results of this project elicit culturally appropriate recommendations for community-driven supports that address healthy brain aging. These outcomes are relevant to other Indigenous communities as the framework for determining that culturally appropriate health supports can be adapted to the unique context of many communities.",
