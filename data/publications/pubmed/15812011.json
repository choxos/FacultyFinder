  "title": "Biotinylation facilitates the uptake of large peptides by Escherichia coli and other gram-negative bacteria.",
  "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli can normally only take up small peptides less than 650 Da, or five to six amino acids, in size. We have found that biotinylated peptides up to 31 amino acids in length can be taken up by E. coli and that uptake is dependent on the biotin transporter. Uptake could be competitively inhibited by free biotin or avidin and blocked by the protonophore carbonyl m-chlorophenylhydrazone and was abolished in E. coli mutants that lacked the biotin transporter. Biotinylated peptides could be used to supplement the growth of a biotin auxotroph, and the transported peptides were shown to be localized to the cytoplasm in cell fractionation experiments. The uptake of biotinylated peptides was also demonstrated for two other gram-negative bacteria, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This finding may make it possible to create new peptide antibiotics that can be used against gram-negative pathogens. Researchers have used various moieties to cause the illicit transport of compounds in bacteria, and this study demonstrates the illicit transport of the largest known compound to date.",
