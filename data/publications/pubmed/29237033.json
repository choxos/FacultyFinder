  "title": "Colchicine for Prevention of Perioperative Atrial Fibrillation in patients undergoing lung resection surgery: a pilot randomized controlled study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We carried out a pilot randomized controlled study to determine the feasibility of a large trial evaluating the impact of colchicine versus placebo on postoperative atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (POAF) among patients undergoing lung resection surgery. METHODS: Patients ≥55 years of age undergoing lung resection surgery were randomly assigned to receive colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo starting a few hours before surgery. Postoperatively, patients received colchicine 0.6 mg or placebo twice daily for an additional 9 days. Our feasibility outcomes included the period of time required to recruit 100 patients, the completeness of follow-up and compliance with the study drug. The primary efficacy outcome was POAF within 30 days of randomization. RESULTS: One hundred patients were randomized (49 to colchicine and 51 to placebo) over a period of 12 months at 2 centres in Canada. All patients completed the 30-day follow-up. The mean staff time required to recruit and to follow-up each patient was 165 min. In all, 71% of patients completed the study drug course without interruption. Patient refusal to continuing taking the study drug was the main reason for permanent drug discontinuation. New POAF occurred in 5 (10.2%) patients in the colchicine group and 7 (13.7%) patients in the placebo group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.20-2.34). CONCLUSIONS: These results show the feasibility of a trial evaluating Colchicine for the prevention of perioperative Atrial Fibrillation in patients undergoing lung resection surgery. This pilot study will serve as the foundation for the large multicentre COP-AF trial.",
