  "title": "Perceived value and benefits of the Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) programme: a descriptive qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Community Paramedicine (CP) is increasingly being used to provide chronic disease management for vulnerable populations in the community. CP@clinic took place in social housing buildings to support cardiovascular health and diabetes management for older adults. The purpose of this study was to examine participant perceptions of their experience with CP@clinic as well as potential ongoing programme benefits. DESIGN: This descriptive qualitative study used focus groups to understand resident experiences of the CP@clinic programme. Groups were facilitated by experienced moderators using a semistructured guide. An inductive coding approach was used with at least two researchers taking part in each step of the analysis process. SETTING: Community-based social housing buildings in Ontario, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one participants from four CP@clinic sites took part in a focus group. Convenience sampling was used with anyone having taken part in a CP@clinic session being eligible to attend the focus group. RESULTS: Analysis yielded six themes across two broad areas: timely access to health information and services, support to achieve personal health goals, better understanding of healthcare system (Personal Benefits); and sense of community, comfortable and familiar place to talk about health, facilitated communication between healthcare professionals (Programme Structure). Participants experienced discernible health changes that motivated their participation. CP@clinic was viewed as a programme that created connections within the building and outside of it. Participants were enthusiastic for the continuation of the programme and appreciated the consistent support to meet their health goals. CONCLUSIONS: CP@clinic was successful in creating a supportive and friendly environment to facilitate health behavioural changes. Ongoing implementation of CP@clinic would allow residents to continue to build their chronic disease management knowledge and skills.
