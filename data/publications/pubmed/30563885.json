SPECIFICALLY, DOES DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY WITH A COMBINATION OF ASPIRIN AND CLOPIDOGREL LEAD TO A GREATER REDUCTION IN RECURRENT STROKE AND DEATH OVER THE USE OF ASPIRIN ALONE WHEN GIVEN IN THE FIRST 24 HOURS AFTER A HIGH RISK TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK OR MINOR ISCHAEMIC STROKE? AN EXPERT PANEL PRODUCED A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FOR INITIATING DUAL ANTIPLATELET THERAPY WITHIN 24 HOURS OF THE ONSET OF SYMPTOMS, AND FOR CONTINUING IT FOR 10-21 DAYS CURRENT PRACTICE IS TYPICALLY TO USE A SINGLE DRUG.",
