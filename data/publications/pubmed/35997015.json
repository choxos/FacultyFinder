  "title": "A red-NIR fluorescent probe for rapid and visual detection of acrolein.",
  "abstract": "A novel red-NIR probe (SWJT-8) for detecting acrolein by utilizing the Michael addition reaction was developed. SWJT-8 exhibits a series of unique advantages, such as colorimetric discrimination, high selectivity and the fastest response. And this probe has been successfully applied to the detection of intracellular acrolein.",
