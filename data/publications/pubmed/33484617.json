  "title": "Telemedicine in the management of hypertension: Evolving technological platforms for blood pressure telemonitoring.",
  "abstract": "The prevalence of hypertension is high and still increasing in almost all communities regardless of high, middle, or low income. The control rate remains low in most countries. Telemedicine offers possibilities to improve blood pressure control. The past two decades witnessed the fast evolving telecommunication from telephone transmission to smart mobile phone technology for telemedicine. There is some evidence from randomized controlled trials that telemonitoring improves blood pressure control. However, it requires co-interventions. The emerging new technology may offer even more possibilities in telemonitoring and co-interventions, for instance, an interactive platform between patients and health professionals for the management of hypertension. Telemedicine might ultimately change the situation of the unsatisfactory management of hypertension in many communities. It helps fully utilize antihypertensive treatment, the most effective cardiovascular prevention, to achieve the goal of ending atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis in humans.",
