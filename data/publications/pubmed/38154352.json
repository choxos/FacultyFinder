  "title": "The smoldering pandemic: Prevalence of prolonged grief disorder. A cross-sectional study of bereaving adults during the COVID pandemic in Pakistan.",
  "abstract": "The world continues to face unprecedented psycho-social challenges after the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is a young psychiatric condition describing grief exceeding standard cultural, social, and religious norms. We assessed the prevalence of PGD in Pakistan along with its correlation to anxiety, depression, and psychological distress. The prevalence of PGD was estimated to be 15 % with grief intensity correlating with depression, anxiety, and serious mental illness. People who were closely related to the deceased were more likely to experience severe PGD symptoms. Discussions about grief and measures to curb its psychological effects are crucial in the post-pandemic world.",
