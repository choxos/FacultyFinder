  "title": "Canadian Survey on the Diagnosis and Clinical Management of Preterm Premature Rupture of Membranes in Tertiary Centres.",
  "abstract": "This study examines diagnostic and management practices for preterm premature rupture of membranes before 34 weeks in Canada. Between August and November 2023, obstetricians from the Canadian Preterm Birth Network (28 sites) completed an online survey. The response rate was 79% (n = 22). Preferred diagnostic tests include the fern test (91%) and nitrazine paper test (77%). Home management is offered in 64% of sites. The most used antibiotherapy (55%) combines macrolide and ampicillin followed by amoxicillin. Group B Streptococcus status rarely influences delivery timing (86%). Four sites have no management protocol. Preterm premature rupture of membranes management varies across Canada, highlighting the need for standardization.",
