  "title": "Catharanthus roseus-assisted bio-fabricated zinc oxide nanoparticles for promising antibacterial potential against Klebsiella pneumoniae.",
  "abstract": "This study emphasized on the synthesis of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) in an environmentally friendly manner from the extract of Catharanthus roseus leaves and its antibacterial assessment against the pneumonia-causing pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae. This simple and convenient phytosynthesis approach is found to be beneficial over conventional methods, wherein plants serve as excellent reducing, capping, and stabilizing agents that enables the formation of ZnO NPs without the use of harmful chemicals. The formation of ZnO NPs was confirmed through several characterization techniques such as UV-visible spectroscopy, XRD, FT-IR, SEM, HR-TEM, and EDX. XRD analysis revealed high polycrystallinity with crystallite size of approximately 13 nm. SEM and HR-TEM revealed the hexagonal structure of ZnO NPs with the particle size range of 20-50 nm. The EDX shows the elemental purity without any impurity. Furthermore, the antibacterial efficacy by the technique of disc diffusion exhibited clear inhibition zones in ZnO NPs-treated discs. In addition, 125 Âµg/mL of ZnO NP concentration showed minimum inhibition by the microbroth dilution method. The potent inhibitory activity was further validated with trypan blue dye exclusion and fluorescence microscopy. Finally, SEM examination confirmed the efficient antibacterial potential of ZnO NPs through disruption of the intact morphology of Klebsiella pneumoniae.",
