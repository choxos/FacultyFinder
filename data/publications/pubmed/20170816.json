  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study examined the predictors of early complications after defibrillator implantation. BACKGROUND: Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators are widely used, predictors of procedural complications and the consequences of these events have not been determined. METHODS: In a prospective, multicenter, population-based clinical outcomes registry of all newly implanted defibrillator patients at 18 centers in Ontario, Canada, we examined 45-day complications and all-cause mortality from February 2007 to May 2009. Complications were determined longitudinally and were categorized as direct implant-related or indirect events. RESULTS: Among 3,340 patients (mean age 63.8 +/- 12.5 years, 78.5% men), major complications occurred in 4.1% of de novo procedures. Compared with those undergoing a single-chamber device, implantation of a cardiac resynchronization defibrillator (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 2.17, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.38 to 3.43, p < 0.001) or dual-chamber device (adjusted HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.19 to 2.79, p = 0.006) was associated with increased risk of major complications. Major complications were increased in women (adjusted HR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.16, p = 0.037) and when left ventricular end-systolic dimension exceeded 45 mm (adjusted HR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.08 to 2.20, p = 0.018). Major complications (excluding death) occurring early after defibrillator implantation were associated with increased adjusted risk of subsequent death up to 180 days after defibrillator implant (adjusted HR: 3.70, 95% CI: 1.64 to 8.33, p = 0.002). Direct implant-related complications were associated with increased risk of early death (adjusted HR: 24.89, p = 0.01), whereas indirect clinical complications conferred increased risk of near-term death (adjusted HR: 12.35, p < 0.001) after defibrillator implantation. CONCLUSIONS: Complications after de novo defibrillator implantation were strongly associated with device type. Major complications were associated with increased risk of mortality.",
