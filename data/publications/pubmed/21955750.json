  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in the detection of parathyroid adenoma and hyperplasia in the setting of primary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: Records of 48 patients with biochemically confirmed primary hyperparathyroidism, who underwent preoperative imaging with 16- or 64-slice contrast-enhanced MDCT and subsequent successful parathyroidectomy over a 3-year period, were reviewed. Two radiologists, blinded to the operative and histologic findings, independently evaluated multiplanar computed tomographic images for all patients. RESULTS: On pathologic examination, 63 abnormal glands were confirmed in 41 female and 7 male patients (mean age, 63 years). Of the 63 abnormal glands, 40 were adenomatous and 23 were hyperplastic. MDCT demonstrated an 88% (95% confidence interval [CI], 77%-99%) positive predictive value for localizing abnormal hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The sensitivity of MDCT in detecting single-gland disease was 80% (95% CI, 68%-92%); whereas the specificity for ruling out hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue, either adenomatous or hyperplastic, was 75% (95% CI, 51%-99%). The sensitivity for exclusively localizing parathyroid hyperplasia was 17% (95% CI, 2%-33%). The parathyroid adenomas were substantially larger and heavier than their hyperplastic counterparts, with an average weight of 1.51 g (range, 0.08-6.00 g) and 0.42 g (range, 0.02-2.0 g) for adenoma and hyperplasia, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Contrast-enhanced MDCT demonstrated an 88% positive predictive value for localizing adenomatous and hyperplastic parathyroid glands. The poor sensitivity for detection of multigland disease was likely a result of the smaller size and weight of the abnormal hyperplastic glands.",
