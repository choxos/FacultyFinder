  "title": "Subscapularis-sparing approaches in shoulder arthroplasty: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Novel approaches for anatomic and reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA and rTSA) that spare the subscapularis (SSC) have recently been described. Outcomes for the SSC-sparing approach were evaluated through this systematic review. METHODS: Medline, Embase, PubMed, and CENTRAL were searched. RESULTS: From 2051 citations, 8 studies were included (aTSA group, n = 241; rTSA group, n = 68). SSC-sparing aTSA and rTSA were associated with significant postoperative improvements in shoulder function and range of motion at 12- to 24-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The SSC-sparing approach may provide a safe alternative for up to two years post-surgery. Evidence for long-term use remains inconclusive.",
