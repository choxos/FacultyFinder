  "abstract": "Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been used successfully to treat native aortic valve regurgitation. Current observational evidence shows promising results in terms of procedural success while outcome data are difficult to interpret given the observational nature of the evidence. We are ready for a randomized trial, which will be very challenging to run.",
