  "title": "Sex Differences in the Clinical Presentation and Natural History of Dilated Cardiomyopathy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Biological sex has a diverse impact on the cardiovascular system. Its influence on dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains unresolved. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate sex-specific differences in DCM presentation, natural history, and prognostic factors. METHODS: The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study of DCM patients assessing baseline characteristics, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, biomarkers, and genotype. The composite outcome was cardiovascular mortality or major heart failure (HF) events. RESULTS: Overall, 206 females and 398 males with DCM were followed for a median of 3.9 years. At baseline, female patients had higher left ventricular ejection fraction, smaller left ventricular volumes, less prevalent mid-wall myocardial fibrosis (23% vs 42%), and lower high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I than males (all P < 0.05) with no difference in time from diagnosis, age at enrollment, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide levels, pathogenic DCM genetic variants, myocardial fibrosis extent, or medications used for HF. Despite a more favorable profile, the risk of the primary outcome at 2 years was higher in females than males (8.6% vs 4.4%, adjusted HR: 3.14; 95% CI: 1.55-6.35; P = 0.001). Between 2 and 5 years, the effect of sex as a prognostic modifier attenuated. Age, mid-wall myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular ejection fraction, left atrial volume, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I, left bundle branch block, and NYHA functional class were not sex-specific prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The authors identified a novel paradox in prognosis for females with DCM. Female DCM patients have a paradoxical early increase in major HF events despite less prevalent myocardial fibrosis and a milder phenotype at presentation. Future studies should interrogate the mechanistic basis for these sex differences.",
