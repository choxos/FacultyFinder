  "title": "Blood Pressure Outcomes in NICU-Admitted Infants with Neonatal Hypertension: A Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To describe the blood pressure outcomes of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) with idiopathic (nonsecondary) hypertension (HTN) who were discharged on antihypertensive therapy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective, multicenter study of 14 centers within the Pediatric Nephrology Research Consortium. We included all infants with a diagnosis of idiopathic HTN discharged from the NICU on antihypertensive treatment. The primary outcome was time to discontinuation of antihypertensive therapy, grouped into (≤6 months, >6 months to 1 year, and >1 year). Comparisons between groups were made with χ[2] tests, Fisher's exact tests, and ANOVA. RESULTS: Data from 118 infants (66% male) were included. Calcium channel blockers were the most prescribed class of antihypertensives (56%) in the cohort. The percentages remaining on antihypertensives after NICU discharge were 60% at 6 months, 26% at 1 year, and 7% at 2 years. Antenatal steroid treatment was associated with decreased likelihood of antihypertensive therapy >1 year after discharge. CONCLUSIONS: This multicenter study reports that most infants admitted to the NICU diagnosed with idiopathic HTN will discontinue antihypertensive treatment by 2 years after NICU discharge. These data provide important insights into the outcome of neonatal HTN, but should be confirmed prospectively.",
