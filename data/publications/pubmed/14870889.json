  "abstract": "Children undergoing successful renal transplantation anticipate optimal growth and development. The use of rhGH pre- and post-Tx has been evaluated and supported by randomized control trials. Several strategies are required to maximize the potential benefit of this treatment in the renal population including provision of adequate nutrition intake, following bone parameters with appropriate interventions, and strategies to reduce steroid therapy including utilization of alternate day steroid treatment. Studies are required to further assess the impact of rhGH on renal allograft function, rejection risk, and allograft ultrastructural changes.",
