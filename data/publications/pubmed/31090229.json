  "title": "A Novel Ultrasound Technique Called Saline Infusion SonoPODography to Visualize and Understand the Pouch of Douglas and Posterior Compartment Contents: A Feasibility Study.",
  "abstract": "Women with infertility are often investigated with saline-infusion sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast-sonography. The high prevalence of endometriosis in this population also warrants an evaluation with transvaginal ultrasound for deep endometriosis. To minimize investigations, we prospectively evaluated the feasibility of a novel combined ultrasound technique called saline-infusion sonoPODography. In most patients, the fluid infused to assess the cavity and tubal patency spilled through patent tubes and filled the pouch of Douglas, yielding a \"standoff\" view of posterior compartment structures, including uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, and the pouch of Douglas. We believe this improved our ability to evaluate this space.",
