  "title": "Reducible problem for a class of almost-periodic non-linear Hamiltonian systems.",
  "abstract": "This paper studies the reducibility of almost-periodic Hamiltonian systems with small perturbation near the equilibrium which is described by the following Hamiltonian system: d x d t = J [ A + ε Q (t , ε) ] x + ε g (t , ε) + h (x , t , ε) . It is proved that, under some non-resonant conditions, non-degeneracy conditions, the suitable hypothesis of analyticity and for the sufficiently small ε, the system can be reduced to a constant coefficients system with an equilibrium by means of an almost-periodic symplectic transformation.",
