  "abstract": "John Turnbull FREng introduces, in this article, three reports on various aspects of risk and engineering. The reports were produced by a number of working groups consisting of Fellows of The Royal Academy of Engineering and social scientists. Each addressed areas of common concern arising from a series of seminars on risk. The reports are titled \"The Societal Aspects of Risk\", \"Common Methodologies for Risk Assessment & Management\", and \"Risks Posed by Humans in the Control Loop\". The reports can be downloaded from The Royal Academy of Engineering's web site--www.raeng.org.uk Feedback on the reports is welcomed, and suggestions for addressing other areas of risk will be considered. Many of the recommendations considered in the reports are forming part of an ongoing work programme in this area.",
