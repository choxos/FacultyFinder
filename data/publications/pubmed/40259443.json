  "title": "Quality Analysis of Measurement Properties of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Vitiligo and of the Studies Assessing Them: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Evaluating measurement properties (MPs) of Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) in vitiligo is essential for evidence-based recommendations and identifying research gaps. This study assesses the quality of PROMs used in vitiligo. A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (up to 20 February 2024) included studies on PROM analysis or development, excluding those validating other tools. Quality assessments followed the COSMIN guidelines. PROMs with the highest number MPs rated sufficient (supported by moderate/high Quality of Evidence [QoE]) were reported per construct category, and information related to content validity specifically was provided. Forty articles on 24 PROMs (=161 MP studies) were analyzed. In the QoL group, the VIT, VLQI, VIP-FS, and ViPPO had the highest number of MPs rated sufficient (n = 3). For severity-related constructs, the Self-Assessment Vitiligo Extent Score (SA-VES) had the most MPs rated sufficient (n = 3). For treatment-related PROMs, the BMQ had the highest number MPs rated sufficient (n = 2). Content validity was limitedly assessed in 12 different PROMs. Comprehensive MP assessment and further validation of vitiligo PROMs are necessary to make definitive conclusions. These systematic reviews are registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020216338). Only English publications were included, which may limit the scope. Additionally, systematic searches conducted by different reviewers in consecutive updates may introduce subjectivity.",
