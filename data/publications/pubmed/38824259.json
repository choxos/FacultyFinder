  "title": "Benign splenic lesions in BAP1-tumor predisposition syndrome: a case series.",
  "abstract": "BAP1-Tumor Predisposition Syndrome (TPDS) is caused by germline variants in BAP1 and predisposes to solid tumors. After observation of a radiologically malignant-appearing splenic mass with benign pathology in a patient with BAP1-TPDS, we sought to retrospectively characterize splenic lesions in individuals with BAP1-TPDS seen at a comprehensive cancer center. A dedicated radiology review for splenic abnormalities was performed. We identified 37 individuals with BAP1-TPDS, 81% with a history of cancer. Of 33 individuals with abdominal imaging, 10 (30%) had splenic lesions, and none were shown to be malignant on follow-up. Splenectomy in an individual with suspected splenic angiosarcoma showed a benign vascular neoplasm with loss of nuclear staining for BAP1 in a subset of cells. Benign splenic lesions appear to be common and potentially BAP1-driven in individuals with BAP1-TPDS; confirmation of these findings could lead to more conservative management and avoidance of splenectomy.",
