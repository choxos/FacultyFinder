  "title": "Cerebral venous thrombosis during pregnancy in the setting of type I antithrombin deficiency: case report and literature review.",
  "abstract": "Inherited antithrombin deficiency is estimated to carry a 50% risk of a venous thrombotic complication during each pregnancy and puerperium. We present a case of a female with heterozygous type I antithrombin deficiency who presented with a central nervous system transverse sinus thrombosis in the third trimester of pregnancy despite the use of therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin, as venous thromboembolic prophylaxis, since conception. A successful pregnancy outcome was achieved with the combined use of therapeutic anticoagulation and regular plasma-derived antithrombin concentrate infusions to normalize her antithrombin levels. This case lends further debate to the issue of whether antithrombin concentrate, in addition to anticoagulation, should be routinely administered for venous thromboembolic prophylaxis during pregnancy and the puerperium to women with inherited antithrombin deficiency. This point may become more relevant as further experience is gained with the use of recombinant human antithrombin.",
