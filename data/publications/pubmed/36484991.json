  "title": "Association of Psychosocial Stress With Risk of Acute Stroke.",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Psychosocial stress is considered a modifiable risk factor for stroke. Given the prevalence of chronic and acute exposure to stress, it represents a potentially attractive target for population-health interventions. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association of psychosocial stress with the risk of acute stroke and explore factors that might modify the association of stress with risk of acute stroke in a large international population. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: INTERSTROKE is an international retrospective case-control study of risk factors for first acute stroke in 32 countries in Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and Africa. A total of 13 462 patients with stroke and 13 488 matched controls were recruited between January 11, 2007, and August 8, 2015. The present analyses were performed from June 1 to 30, 2021, and included 13 350 cases and 13 462 controls with available data on psychosocial stress. EXPOSURES: Psychosocial stress and occurrence of stressful life events within the preceding year were measured using a standardized questionnaire of self-reported stress at home and work. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The association of stress with acute stroke and its subtypes was examined using multivariable conditional logistic regression and factors that might modify the association, particularly self-reported locus of control. RESULTS: Among 26 812 participants included in the analysis, the mean (SD) age of cases was 62.2 (13.6) years; that of controls, 61.3 (13.3) years; 7960 cases (59.6%) and 8017 controls (59.6%) were men. Several periods of stress and permanent stress were reported for 2745 cases (20.5%) and 1933 controls (14.4%), with marked regional variation in prevalence, with the lowest in China (201 of 3981 [5.0%] among controls and 364 of 3980 [9.1%] among cases) and highest in South East Asia (233 of 855 [26.1%] among controls and 241 of 782 [30.8%] among cases). Increased stress at home (odds ratio [OR], 1.95 [95% CI, 1.77-2.15]) and at work (OR, 2.70 [95% CI, 2.25-3.23]) and recent stressful life events (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.19-1.43]) were associated with an increased risk of acute stroke on multivariable analyses (vs no self-reported stress). Higher locus of control at home was associated with a reduced odds of all stroke (OR, 0.73 [95% CI, 0.68-0.79]), and higher locus of control both at work and at home were associated with a lower odds of acute stroke and significantly diminished the association with stress at work (OR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.88-2.58]; P = .008 for interaction) and home (OR, 1.69 [95% CI, 1.44-1.98]; P < .001 for interaction) for acute stroke. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Psychosocial stress is a common risk factor for acute stroke. The findings of this case-control study suggest that higher locus of control is associated with lower risk of stroke and may be an important effect modifier of the risk associated with psychosocial stress.",
