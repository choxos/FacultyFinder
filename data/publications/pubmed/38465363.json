  "title": "Outcomes of Eyes Lost to Follow-up After Treatment With Intraocular or Periocular Steroid Injections.",
  "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the visual, intraocular pressure (IOP), and anatomic outcomes of eyes with loss to follow-up (LTFU) after intravitreal or periocular steroid injections. Methods: Patients receiving intraocular or periocular steroid injections and with LTFU for at least 180 days were included in this retrospective cohort study. Charts were reviewed for the visual acuity (VA), IOP, and central foveal thickness at the visit before LTFU, the first return visit, and 3, 6, and 12 months after return. Results: Fifty-three eyes of 47 patients were identified. The mean (±SD) age was 62.3 ± 14.9 years, the mean LTFU time was 295 ± 181.2 days (range, 182-1101), and the mean follow-up after return was 354 ± 339.3 days (range, 32-1141). The overall mean number of steroid injections was 5.2 ± 3.9 (range, 1-18). Compared with the mean logMAR VA at the visit before LTFU (0.59 [Snellen 20/77]), the mean VA remained stable at all timepoints after return as follows: return visit (0.62 [20/83]; P = .6), month 3 (0.55 [20/70]; P = .6), month 6 (0.55 [20/70]; P = .5), month 12 (0.64 [20/87]; P = .6), and final visit (0.69 [20/97]; P = .2). At the first return visit, 8 (15%) of 53 patients had an IOP of 21 mm Hg or higher (range, 21-31); 2 required treatment with a new antihypertensive medication (latanoprost and timolol, respectively). Conclusions: Patients with LTFU after receiving steroid injections maintained their VA. No patient required incisional glaucoma surgery. Compared with other etiologies, eyes with diabetic macular edema had a greater increase in IOP.",
