  "title": "Gonorrhea and Chlamydia Rates Among 12- to 24-Year-Old Patients in an Urban Health System.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) infection rates continue to rise. Screening guidelines have largely focused on sexually active female individuals and men who have sex with men populations. Health care system testing and infection rates, particularly among heterosexual male individuals, are poorly understood. Our aim was to evaluate CT and GC testing and prevalence among 12- to 24-year-old patients in an urban federally qualified health center system. METHODS: This retrospective study analyzed electronic health record data from 2017 to 2019 in a large system of federally qualified health centers in Denver, CO. Abstracted data included demographics, sexual activity, sexual orientation, and laboratory results. Ï‡2 Tests were used to evaluate differences between groups. RESULTS: Of the 44,021 patients included, 37.6% were tested, 15.0% were positive for CT, and 3.4% were positive for GC. Heterosexual male patients had a testing rate of 22.8% and positivity rates of CT and GC at 13.1% and 3.0%, respectively. Among tested patients documented as not sexually active, 7.5% were positive for CT. Multiple or reinfections were detected in 29% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows low testing rates and high rates of CT and GC infections among all patients, including heterosexual male patients and those documented as not sexually active. Improved screening of these populations in the primary care setting may be key to combating the sexually transmitted disease epidemic.",
