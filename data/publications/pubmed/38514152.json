  "title": "Investigation of divergent thinking among surgeons and surgeon trainees in Canada (IDEAS): a mixed-methods study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the creative potential of surgeons and surgeon trainees, as measured by divergent thinking. The secondary objectives were to identify factors associated with divergent thinking, assess confidence in creative problem-solving and the perceived effect of surgical training on creative potential, and explore the value of creativity in surgery. DESIGN: We used a mixed-methods design, conducting a survey of divergent thinking ability using a validated questionnaire followed by two semi-structured interviews with top-scoring participants. PARTICIPANTS & SETTING: Surgeons and surgeon trainees in the Department of Surgery at McMaster University. OUTCOMES: The primary outcome was divergent thinking, assessed with the Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults. Participants also self-assessed their confidence in creative problem-solving and the effect of surgical training on their creative potential. We performed descriptive analyses and multivariable linear regression to identify factors associated with divergent thinking. We conducted a thematic analysis of the interview responses. RESULTS: 82 surgeons and surgeon trainees were surveyed; 43 were junior trainees and 28 were senior trainees. General surgery, orthopaedic surgery and plastic surgery represented 71.9% of the participants. The median participant age was 28 years (range 24-73), 51.2% of whom were female. Participants demonstrated levels of divergent thinking that were higher but not meaningfully different from the adult norm (62.39 (95% CI 61.25, 63.53), p<0.001). While participants scored significantly higher than the average adult on fluency (the ability to produce quantities of ideas) and flexibility (the ability to process information in different ways) (p<0.001 for both), they scored below average on originality (the ability to produce uncommon, new or unique ideas) (p<0.001). Regression analysis identified higher divergent thinking scores among females (estimated Î²=-3.58 (95% CI -6.25 to -0.90), p=0.010). CONCLUSIONS: The divergent thinking ability among surgeons and surgeon trainees was not meaningfully different from the adult normative score; however, their ability to generate original ideas was below average.",
