  "title": "Reduction of surgical site infections in pediatric patients with complicated appendicitis: Utilization of antibiotic stewardship principles and quality improvement methodology.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) after appendectomy for complicated appendicitis (CA) was high at our children's hospital. We hypothesized that practice standardization, including obtaining intra-operative cultures of abdominal fluid in patients with CA, would improve outcomes and reduce healthcare utilization after appendectomy. METHODS: A quality improvement team designed and implemented a clinical practice guideline for CA that included obtaining intra-operative culture of purulent fluid, administering piperacillin/tazobactam for at least 72 h post-operatively, and transitioning to oral antibiotics based on intraoperative culture data. We compared outcomes before and after guideline implementation. RESULTS: From July 2018-October 2019, 63 children underwent appendectomy for CA compared to 41 children from January-December 2020. Compliance with our process measures are as follows: Intra-operative culture was obtained in 98% of patients post-implementation; 95% received at least 72 h of piperacillin-tazobactam; and culture results were checked on all patients. Culture results altered the choice of discharge antibiotics in 12 (29%) of patients. All-cause morbidity (SSI, emergency department visit, readmission to hospital, percutaneous drain, unplanned return to operating room) decreased significantly from 35% to 15% (p=0.02). Surgical site infections became less frequent, occurring on average every 27 days pre-implementation and every 60 days after care pathway implementation (p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Utilization of a clinical practice guideline was associated with reduced morbidity after appendectomy for CA. Intra-operative fluid culture during appendectomy for CA appears to facilitate the selection of appropriate post-operative antibiotics and, thus, minimize SSIs and overall morbidity.",
