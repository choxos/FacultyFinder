  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Adolescent deliveries remain a public health problem in most developing countries. The aim of our study was to determine the prevalence, trends and outcome of adolescent deliveries in an urban setting in Cameroon. We carried out a retrospective register analysis over a 6-year period (January 2010-December 2015) at the Saint Albert Le Grand hospital Douala. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of adolescent deliveries was 8.2% (662 out of 8056). There was a significant decrease over the 6-year period (p-trend: < 0.05). Adolescents were at higher risk of preterm deliveries (gestational age < 37 weeks; odds ratio [OR], 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]; 1.3-2.2; p < 0.01): low birth weight (defined as birth weight < 2650 g, OR; 1.7, CI 1.4-2.2, p < 0.01) and asphyxia at 1st minute (OR, 1.5; 95% CI 1.1-2.2; p = 0.02). There was no difference in delivery outcomes between early and late adolescents. Our results suggest that the prevalence of adolescent deliveries is lower in urban settings. Adolescent deliveries are more likely to result in adverse fetal outcomes than adult deliveries. Measures directed towards the prevention of adolescent pregnancies should be implemented to reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality.",
