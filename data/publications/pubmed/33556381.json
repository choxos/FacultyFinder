  "title": "Efficacy and Safety of Intravitreal Aflibercept Treat-and-Extend for Macular Edema in Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: the CENTERA Study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept (IVT-AFL) treat-and-extend dosing in patients with macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). DESIGN: CENTERA (Evaluation of a Treat and Extend Regimen of Intravitreal Aflibercept for Macular Edema Secondary to CRVO; NCT02800642) was an open-label, Phase 4 clinical study. METHODS: Patients received 2 mg of IVT-AFL at baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter, until disease stability criteria were met (or until week 20), at which point treatment intervals were adjusted in 2-week increments based on functional and anatomic outcomes. RESULTS: From baseline to week 76, 105 patients (65.6%) (P <.0001 [test against threshold of 40%]) gained ≥15 letters; and, during the treat-and-extend phase, 72 patients (45.0%) (P = 0.8822 [test against threshold of 50%]) achieved a mean treatment interval of ≥8 weeks. A last and next planned treatment interval of ≥8 weeks was achieved by 101 patients (63.1%) and by 108 patients (67.5%), respectively. Mean ± SD best-corrected visual acuity increased from 51.9 ± 16.8 letters at baseline to 72.3 ± 18.5 letters at week 76 (mean change: +20.3 ± 19.5 letters), and central retinal thickness decreased from 759.9 ± 246.0 µm at baseline to 265.4 ± 57.9 µm at week 76 (mean change: -496.1 ± 252.4 µm). The safety profile of IVT-AFL was consistent with that of previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically meaningful improvements in functional and anatomic outcomes were achieved with IVT-AFL treat-and-extend dosing. Most patients achieved a last actual and last intended treatment interval of ≥8 weeks; therefore, treatment intervals may have been extended even further with a longer study duration.",
