  "title": "Primary Open Abductor Reconstruction: A 5 to 10-Year Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gluteal tears are recognized as the source of pain over the greater trochanter. We investigated the outcome of primary open abductor tendon reconstruction with a 5-10 year follow-up. METHODS: One hundred sixty-five consecutive hips underwent an open abductor tendon reconstruction, with all tears confirmed preoperatively by magnetic resonance imaging. Oxford Hip Scores (OHS) were assessed at the initial visit, and at 5-10 years. RESULTS: The average preoperative OHS was 22 (range 7-34) and average postoperative OHS was 40 a difference of 18 (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Surgical reconstruction of degenerate abductor tendons should be considered in the presence of a magnetic resonance imaging confirmed separation where clinical findings are consistent with the known tendon disruption. Open transosseous reconstruction reliably results in good pain relief at 5-10 years.",
