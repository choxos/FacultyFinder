  "title": "Severe Epididymo-Orchitis and Encephalitis Complicating Anti-PD-1 Therapy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab have emerged as active treatment options for patients with many cancers, including metastatic melanoma, but can also cause symptomatic or life-threatening immune-related adverse events, including encephalitis. Epididymitis and orchitis are rare complications of these therapies. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe herein a patient with metastatic melanoma who developed epididymo-orchitis followed by encephalitis while receiving pembrolizumab. The patient developed testicular pain and fever after his third dose of pembrolizumab; ultrasound evaluation demonstrated bilateral epididymo-orchitis. He then developed headaches, fever, and altered mental status over the next week and was admitted to the hospital. Lumbar puncture revealed inflammatory changes consistent with meningoencephalitis; he did not improve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, and an extensive workup for infectious etiologies, including cerebrospinal fluid testing using a clinical metagenomic next-generation sequencing assay, was negative. He received high-dose steroids for suspected autoimmune encephalitis, and both his orchitis and meningoencephalitis improved rapidly after one dose. He fully recovered after a 5-week taper of oral steroids. DISCUSSION: Here, we report a case of epididymo-orchitis complicating immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This patient subsequently developed severe encephalitis but rapidly improved with steroids. Clinicians should be aware of rare complications of these agents. KEY POINTS: Epididymo-orchitis is a rare and potentially life-threatening complication of anti-programmed death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) therapy.For patients on anti-PD-1 therapy who develop either epididymo-orchitis or epididymitis without clear infectious cause, immune-related adverse events should be considered in the differential diagnosis.If severe, epididymo-orchitis related to anti-PD-1 therapy may be treated with high-dose corticosteroids.",
