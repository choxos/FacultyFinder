  "title": "Detection of right ventricular dysfunction in acute pulmonary embolism by computed tomography or echocardiography: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction predicts worse outcomes in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Because computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography visualizes cardiac structures, it is a potential method for assessing RV function without the delays associated with inpatient echocardiography. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic accuracy of CT scan findings for detecting RV dysfunction compared with echocardiography. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from inception to April 2020 for studies comparing RV dysfunction on CT scan with echocardiography standard. Study quality was assessed with the QUADAS-2 risk of bias tool. Meta-analysis was performed using a bivariate mixed effects regression framework. RESULTS: After screening, 26 studies (3508 patients) were included. In a pooled analysis, septal deviation (5 studies; 459 patients) had a sensitivity of 0.31 (95% CI 0.25-0.38; I[2]  = 0%), specificity of 0.98 (95% CI 0.90-1.00; I[2]  = 59.4%), and positive likelihood ratio of 13.6 (95% CI 3.1-60.4) for RV dysfunction compared with echocardiography. The pooled sensitivity of increased RV/left ventricular ratio (21 studies; 3111 patients) was 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.87; I[2]  = 81.8%), whereas the pooled specificity was 0.75 (95% CI 0.66-0.82; I[2]  = 94.2%) and negative likelihood ratio was 0.23 (0.18-0.29). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, RV dysfunction can be detected by CT imaging but the diagnostic accuracy when compared with echocardiography varies depending on specific findings. The presence of septal bowing appears to be highly specific for RV dysfunction. Our findings suggest that multiple CT findings of RV dysfunction may improve diagnostic accuracy and further studies are warranted.",
