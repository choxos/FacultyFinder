  "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory condition affecting the colon's mucosal lining, leading to chronic bowel inflammation. Despite extensive research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying UC pathogenesis remain elusive. NcRNAs form a category of functional RNA molecules devoid of protein-coding capacity. They have recently surfaced as pivotal modulators of gene expression and integral participants in various pathological processes, particularly those related to inflammatory disorders. The diverse classes of ncRNAs, encompassing miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs, have been implicated in UC. It highlights their involvement in key UC-related processes, such as immune cell activation, epithelial barrier integrity, and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. ncRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for UC diagnosis and monitoring disease progression, offering promising avenues for personalized medicine. This approach may pave the way for novel, more specific treatments with reduced side effects, addressing the current limitations of conventional therapies. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between ncRNAs and UC will advance our knowledge of the disease, potentially leading to more effective and personalized treatments for patients suffering from this debilitating condition. This review explores the pivotal role of ncRNAs in the context of UC, shedding light on their possible targets for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic interventions.",
