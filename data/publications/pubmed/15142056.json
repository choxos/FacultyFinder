  "title": "Acute renal transplant injury and interaction between antithymocyte globulin and pooled human immunoglobulin.",
  "abstract": "The increasing number of highly sensitized patients awaiting renal transplantation has prompted the use of induction immunosuppression regimens including pooled human intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) combined with polyclonal anti-lymphocyte sera. We report a case of a patient who received a live donor transplant after abrogation of donor-specific positive cytotoxic crossmatch by IVIG. She developed early acute tubular injury associated with IVIG, mannitol, and hypertonic saline infusion. Furthermore, a possible interaction between IVIG and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) occurred, suggested by an increased number of peripheral CD3(+) lymphocytes after initial rapid lymphodepletion. We suggest that IVIG-associated nephrotoxicity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of early allograft dysfunction, and furthermore, that IVIG may interact with polyclonal antilymphocyte serum to affect the amount of lymphodepletion achieved.",
