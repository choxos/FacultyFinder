  "abstract": "Ticks are a public health threat due to their tendency to spread pathogens that affect humans and animals. With reports of Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus invasion in neighbouring countries, there is the risk of this species invading Ghana through livestock trade. Previous identification of tick species in Ghana has been based on morphological identification, which can be ineffective, especially with damaged tick specimens or engorged nymphs. This study focused on the Kassena-Nankana District, which serves as a trade route for cattle into Ghana, to determine the presence of R. microplus. Three genera of ticks were identified as Amblyomma (70.9%), Hyalomma (21.3%) and Rhipicephalus (7.8%). The engorged nymphs that could not be identified morphologically were analyzed using primers that target the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene. This study reports the first record of R. (B.) microplus in Ghana. Furthermore, R. microplus constituted 54.8% of the Boophilus species collected in this study. This finding is an addition to the diverse tick species previously collected in Ghana, most of which are of veterinary and public health importance. With reports of acaricide resistance in R. microplus and its role in spreading infectious pathogens, the detection of this species in Ghana cannot be overlooked. Nationwide surveillance will be essential to ascertain its distribution, its effects on cattle production, and the control measures adopted.",
