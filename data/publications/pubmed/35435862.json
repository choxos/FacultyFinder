  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: We compared the efficacy of adalimumab, infliximab, ustekinumab, and vedolizumab on the ability to achieve endoscopic healing (EH) after 1 year of therapy in moderate-severe Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: This was a pooled analysis of patient-level data from 299 patients with CD from 4 clinical trials. Proportions of patients treated with each biologic were compared for achieving 1-year complete EH (Simple Endoscopic Score for CD [SES-CD] <3) and ileal and colonic EH separately (SES-CD = 0). Multivariate logistic regression was used to model the relationship between biologics and 1-year outcomes and adjusted for disease duration, concomitant corticosteroid use, and prior antitumor necrosis factor failure. RESULTS: Compared with vedolizumab (4/56 [7.1%]), adalimumab (17/61 [27.9%], adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 5.79, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-18.95, P = 0.004) and infliximab (39/141 [27.7%], aOR: 4.59, 95% CI: 1.48-14.22, P = 0.008) had superior rates of 1-year EH. No significant difference was observed between vedolizumab and ustekinumab. Similar results were observed among biologic-naive patients. Among patients with baseline ileal SES-CD ≥3, no significant differences were observed between biologics for 1-year ileal EH. However, for large (>0.5 cm) ileal ulcers, infliximab (20/49 [40.8%]) had superior rates of no ileal ulcers compared with vedolizumab (2/23 [8.7%], aOR: 5.39, 95% CI: 1.03-28.05, P = 0.045). No other differences were observed. For colonic disease, compared with ustekinumab (9/31 [29.0%]), adalimumab (30/48 [62.5%], aOR: 3.97, 95% CI: 1.45-10.90, P = 0.007) had superior rates of 1-year EH in the colon, with similar trends observed for infliximab (55/105 [52.4%], aOR: 2.08, 95% CI: 0.82-5.27, P = 0.121). No other differences were observed. DISCUSSION: In this post hoc analysis, TNF-α antagonists were overall superior to vedolizumab and ustekinumab for achieving 1-year EH in moderate-severe CD patients.",
