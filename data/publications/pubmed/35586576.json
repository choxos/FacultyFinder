  "abstract": "Gender-affirming care (GAC) is critical to the well-being of transgender and gender diverse youth and was limited by COVID-19 stay-at-home orders. Telehealth created opportunities for youth to continue receiving lifesaving care. We examined the attitudes of patients (n=21) and caregivers (n=38) receiving telehealth-delivered GAC (TGAC) from May to July 2020. Participants completed surveys after telehealth visits. Descriptive statistics compared telehealth with in-person visits across key domains. Overall, 86.5% of patients and 95.4% of caregivers were satisfied with medical TGAC and 94.3% and 93.3% were satisfied with behavioral health TGAC. Future research should determine the effectiveness of TGAC and identify areas for improvement.",
