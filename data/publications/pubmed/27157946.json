  "title": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Glioma in the Era of Antiangiogenic Therapy.",
  "abstract": "Since it supplanted computed tomography in the early 1990s, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has remained the standard tool to evaluate disease status in patients with brain tumors. With the recent adoption of antiangiogenic therapy for gliomas, it has become increasingly clear that leakiness of the blood-brain barrier, the physiologic correlate of contrast enhancement, is affected by a multitude of pathophysiologic processes, not all of which correlate with tumor burden. To address this issue, physiologic imaging including diffusion and perfusion MR imaging has been investigated as an avenue to acquire predictive and prognostic biomarkers useful in the evaluation of high-grade gliomas.",
