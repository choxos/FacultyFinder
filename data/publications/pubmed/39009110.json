  "title": "Effect of Peripheral Interventions in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease Receiving Rivaroxaban and Aspirin: Analyses from the XATOA Registry.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) in XATOA receiving dual pathway inhibition (DPI) with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin according to lower extremity revascularisation (LER) history. METHODS: XATOA is an international, multicentre, prospective, single arm registry study. This subanalysis investigated patients with lower extremity PAD according to LER history. Patients with coronary artery disease, PAD, or both, receiving DPI were followed for 12 or more months. Baseline characteristics and clinical outcomes were assessed according to LER history. A time dependency analysis assessed outcomes by time between the most recent LER procedure and the start of DPI. A multivariable analysis assessed the influence of patient characteristics on clinical outcomes. RESULTS: In XATOA (n = 5 532), 2 820 (51.0%) patients had lower extremity PAD, of whom 1 736 (61.6%) had prior LER and 1 084 (38.4%) had no prior LER. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between patients with or without prior LER. A higher proportion of patients with prior LER experienced any treatment emergency clinical events compared with those without prior LER (15.0% vs. 9.4%, respectively), with greater differences observed between incidence rates of limb events, including major adverse limb events (9.06 vs. 4.09 events per 100 patient years, respectively). Similar rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and major bleeding were observed in both subgroups. Clinical event rates were generally higher in patients who had previous LER for six months or less compared with patients who had previous LET for more than six months before starting DPI, regardless of LER type. Multivariable analyses showed that prior LER was predictive of limb events. CONCLUSION: This subanalysis of XATOA found that prior LER was associated with increased rates of limb events, consistent with results of COMPASS and VOYAGER PAD. Rates of bleeding were also low regardless of LER history and consistent with the findings from these trials.",
