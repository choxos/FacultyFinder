  "abstract": "We performed a small interfering RNA screen to identify targets for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) therapy in the ubiquitin/ubiquitin-like system. We provide evidence for selective anti-cSCC activity of knockdown of the E3 ubiquitin ligase MARCH4, the ATPase p97/VCP, the deubiquitinating enzyme USP8, the cullin-RING ligase (CRL) 4 substrate receptor CDT2/DTL, and components of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Specifically attenuating CRL4[CDT2] by CDT2 knockdown can be more potent in killing cSCC cells than targeting CRLs or CRL4s in general by RBX1 or DDB1 depletion. Suppression of the APC/C or forced APC/C activation by targeting its repressor EMI1 are both potential therapeutic approaches. We observed that cSCC cells can be selectively killed by small-molecule inhibitors of USP8 (DUBs-IN-3/compound 22c) and the NEDD8 E1 activating enzyme/CRLs (MLN4924/pevonedistat). A substantial proportion of cSCC cell lines are very highly MLN4924-sensitive. Pathways that respond to defects in proteostasis are involved in the anti-cSCC activity of p97 suppression. Targeting USP8 can reduce the expression of growth factor receptors that participate in cSCC development. EMI1 and CDT2 depletion can selectively cause DNA re-replication and DNA damage in cSCC cells.",
