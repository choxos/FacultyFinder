  "title": "Risk factors of invasive fungal infections in liver transplant recipients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) remain one of the most common infectious complications after organ transplantation, and liver transplant recipients (LTRs) have the highest mortality rate. However, risk factors associated with IFIs have only been evaluated in small single-center studies. We performed a meta-analysis by conducting a comprehensive search using Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and Cochrane central register of controlled trials. All case-control and cohort studies evaluating risk factors for IFIs in adult LTRs were screened. Utilizing a random-effects model, a multivariate analysis was completed, and 28 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. Rates of IFIs ranged from 1.4% to 32.7%. Previous antibiotic use (OR 9.3; 95% CI 3.2-27.0) and bacterial infection (OR 4.3; 95% CI 2.1-8.6) were risk factors of invasive candidiasis. Yet for invasive aspergillosis, posttransplant renal replacement therapy (OR 9.2; 95% CI 4.2-20.4), reoperation (OR 8.0; 95% CI 2.9-21.7), and cytomegalovirus infection (OR 6.2; 95% CI 2.0-19.3) were risk factors. The top independent risk factors for IFIs during studies from 2010 to 2019 were previous fungal colonization (OR 9.19; 95% CI 4.92-17.16), reoperation (OR 5.45; 95% CI 2.93-10.15), and previous bacterial infections (OR 3.81; 95% CI 2.13-6.83). These risk factors may be targeted by antifungal prophylaxis in LTRs.",
