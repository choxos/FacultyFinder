  "abstract": "It is a well-known fact that to bring a new molecule it may take more than a decade. The existing drugs, which are known for their adverse reaction or toxicity, if utilized and allowed in different formulation, the new effective formulation may be discovered and developed. This may help in reducing various side effects, time and costs. In this study, fungal infection was inoculated superficially over the skin of guinea pigs and treated with the broad-spectrum antimicrobial (gatifloxacin) in combination with non-toxic and effective amount of copper ions. MIC of copper (0.20%) was also determined. Concentration of gatifloxacin (100 μg ml(-1)) with the combination of copper ions (MIC) at which it inhibits the visible growth of fungal strains was also evaluated. Hematological parameters, such as total leukocyte count and differential leukocyte count, were evaluated. The results have shown increase in these parameters after fungal infection, which reaches its normal value after treatment with the combination of gatifloxacin and copper ions. Outcomes of the research concluded that gatifloxacin 100 μg ml(-1) can be used by 0.20% of copper ions to prevent growth of some fungal strains (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger), which causes skin infections with more potency.",
