  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Assessing efficacy of electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in optimizing positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients to enhance respiratory system mechanics and prevent ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), compared to traditional methods. METHODS: We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis, spanning literature from January 2012 to May 2023, sourced from Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE (Ovid), Cochrane, and LILACS, evaluated EIT-guided PEEP strategies in ARDS versus conventional methods. Thirteen studies (3 randomized, 10 non-randomized) involving 623 ARDS patients were analyzed using random-effects models for primary outcomes (respiratory mechanics and mechanical power) and secondary outcomes (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, mortality, stays in intensive care unit (ICU), ventilator-free days). RESULTS: EIT-guided PEEP significantly improved lung compliance (n = 941 cases, mean difference (MD) = 4.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.94, 5.71]), reduced mechanical power (n = 148, MD = - 1.99, 95% CI [- 3.51, - 0.47]), and lowered driving pressure (n = 903, MD = - 1.20, 95% CI [- 2.33, - 0.07]) compared to traditional methods. Sensitivity analysis showed consistent positive effect of EIT-guided PEEP on lung compliance in randomized clinical trials vs. non-randomized studies pooled (MD) = 2.43 (95% CI - 0.39 to 5.26), indicating a trend towards improvement. A reduction in mortality rate (259 patients, relative risk (RR) = 0.64, 95% CI [0.45, 0.91]) was associated with modest improvements in compliance and driving pressure in three studies. CONCLUSIONS: EIT facilitates real-time, individualized PEEP adjustments, improving respiratory system mechanics. Integration of EIT as a guiding tool in mechanical ventilation holds potential benefits in preventing ventilator-induced lung injury. Larger-scale studies are essential to validate and optimize EIT's clinical utility in ARDS management.",
