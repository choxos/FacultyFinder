  "title": "Absorbable and non-absorbable cement augmentation in fixation of intertrochanteric femur fractures: systematic review of the literature.",
  "abstract": "We conducted a systematic review of the literature on the use of both resorbable and non-resorbable cement as an adjunct to internal fixation of intertrochanteric hip fractures. Two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality and extracted relevant data from each included study. In cases in which the outcomes data were similar between studies, data were pooled and analyzed. Seven studies were included after fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two hundred and eighty patients were treated with augmentation and 175 were treated without augmentation. Studies were variable in their ability to demonstrate better functional outcomes in patients who underwent augmentation. However, radiographic parameters (mean lag screw sliding distance and varus deformity) were better in the augmentation group. In terms of complications, failure to use augmentation with a sliding hip screw device in five studies led to 10.8-fold higher likelihood of construct failure (p < 0.01). Augmentation of intertrochanteric femur fractures with polymethyl methacrylate or calcium-phosphate may provide benefits in terms of radiographic parameters and complication rates; however, more stringent research methodology is necessary to determine the extent of the benefit.",
