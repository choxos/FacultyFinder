  "title": "Is being barefoot, wearing shoes and physical activity associated with knee osteoarthritis pain flares? Data from a usually barefoot Sri Lankan cohort.",
  "abstract": "AIM: To identify the association between hours of being barefoot/wearing footwear, physical activity (PA) and knee osteoarthritis pain flares (KOAF). METHODS: Persons with a diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis, who reported previous KOAF, were followed up in a 3 months long telephone-based case-crossover study. Exposures to risk factors were assessed every 10 days and whenever the participants experienced a KOAF. Conditional logistic regression examined associations of KOAF with following: hours of being barefoot/using footwear and PA performed (P < .05). RESULTS: There were 260 persons recruited, of whom 183 continued longitudinal follow up. Of them, 120 persons had at least one valid KOAF and control period. Participants were female (90%) with mean (SD) age and body mass index of 59.9 (7.0) years, 28.0 (5.0) kg/m[2] respectively. Participants were barefoot for a mean duration of 12.7 hours (SD 4.6) and used footwear for 5.1 (SD 4.7) hours daily; 99% wore heel heights <2.5 cm. Duration of being barefoot, 1 and 2 days before, demonstrated reduced multivariate odds of KOAF (odds ratio [OR] = 0.85; 95% CI 0.80-0.90). Moderate PA performed 1, 2 days prior was associated with a significantly increased risk of KOAF (multivariate OR 4.29; 2.52-7.30 and OR 3.36; 2.01-5.61). Similarly, hours of using footwear 1 and 2 days before flare demonstrated increased odds of KOAF (OR 1.15; 1.07-1.23 and 1.10; 1.03-1.18). CONCLUSIONS: Increased duration of being barefoot 1 to 2 days before is associated with reduced risk of KOAF. Performing moderate PA 1 to 2 days before was associated with an increased risk of KOAF.",
