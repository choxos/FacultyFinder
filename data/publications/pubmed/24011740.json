  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important clinical co-morbidity that increases the risk of death and myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) even when treated with guideline-directed therapies. It is unknown, however, whether CKD influences the effects of CAD treatments on patients' health status, their symptoms, function, and quality of life. We performed a post hoc analysis of the Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) study to compare health status in patients with stable CAD with and without CKD defined as a glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) randomized to either percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and optimal medical therapy (OMT) or OMT alone. Health status was measured at baseline, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months of follow-up with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire in 310 patients with CKD and 1,719 patients without CKD. Linear mixed-effects models were used to analyze Seattle Angina Questionnaire scores longitudinally. Mean scores for angina-related quality of life, angina frequency, and physical limitation domains improved from baseline values in both patients with and without CKD and plateaued. Early improvement (1 to 6 months) was more common in patients treated with PCI plus OMT than with OMT alone in both patients with and without CKD. Treatment satisfaction scores were high at baseline in all groups and did not change significantly over time. In conclusion, although CKD is an important determinant of event-free survival in patients with stable CAD, it neither precludes satisfactory treatment of angina with PCI plus OMT or OMT alone nor is it associated with an unsatisfactory quality of life.",
