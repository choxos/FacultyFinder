  "title": "\"Surgery First\" vs. \"Endoscopy First\" for Pediatric Choledocholithiasis Presenting at the End of the Week - A CARES Working Group Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Choledocholithiasis in children is commonly managed with an \"endoscopy-first\" (EF) strategy (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)). Because ERCP availability is often limited at the end of the week (EoW), we hypothesized that a \"surgery-first\" (SF) approach (LC with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) ± transcystic laparoscopic common bile exploration (LCBDE)) would decrease length of stay (LOS) and time to definitive intervention (TTDI). METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was conducted on pediatric patients from 2018 to 2023 with suspected choledocholithiasis. Work week (WW) presentation was defined as admission between Monday to Thursday. TTDI was defined as time to LC or postoperative ERCP (if required). RESULTS: Among seven hospitals, there were 354 pediatric patients; 217 (61%) managed with SF (125 WW, 92 EoW) and 137 (39%) managed with EF (74 WW, 63 EoW). SF groups had a shorter LOS for both WW and EoW presentation (60.2 h and 58.3 h vs 88.5 h and 93.6 h respectively; p < 0.05). TTDI decreased in SF (26.4 h and 28.9 h vs 61.4 h and 72.8 h; p < 0.05). All EF patients underwent at least two anesthetics (preoperative ERCP followed by LC) while the majority (79%) of the SF group had only one procedure (LC + IOC ± LCBDE). CONCLUSION: Children who present with choledocholithiasis at EoW have a longer LOS and TTDI. These findings are amplified when children enter an EF pathway. A surgery-first approach results in fewer procedures, decreased TTDI, and shorter LOS, regardless of the time of presentation. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",
