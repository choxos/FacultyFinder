  "title": "EBM user and practitioner models for graduate medical education: what do residents prefer?",
  "abstract": "The objective of the study reported in this article was to assess and explain medical residents' preferences for the evidence based medicine (EBM) practitioner versus the EBM user models. A self-administered survey and focus group of residents attending a core curriculum EBM master session were undertaken. Most residents, particularly those earlier in their training, preferred the practitioner model. Residents perceived that model as an opportunity to gain advanced EBM skills during residency, as providing the ability to choose practicing under both models, and as offering the gain of independent thinking and greater self-confidence in their critical appraisal skills. The user model had the advantage of reduced time requirements. In sum, the majority of residents preferred a curriculum that focuses on the practitioner over the user model.",
