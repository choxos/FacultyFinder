  "title": "Relationship between high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I and blood pressure among young and healthy adults.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship of cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with conventional and ambulatory blood pressure (BP) in young and healthy adults. METHODS: We performed a population based cross-sectional analysis among 2,072 young and healthy adults aged 25-41 years free of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. cTnI was measured using a highly sensitive (hs) assay. The relationships of high sensitivity cardiac tropononin I (hs-cTnI) with office and 24-hour BP were assessed using multivariable regression analyses. RESULTS: Median age was 37 years and 975 (47%) participants were male. hs-cTnI levels were detectable in 2,061 (99.5%) individuals. Median (interquartile range) hs-cTnI levels were 0.98 (0.71; 1.64) ng/L among men and 0.48 (0.33; 0.71) ng/L among women. Systolic BP, but not diastolic BP, gradually increased across hs-cTnI quartiles (118, 120, 121, and 122 mm Hg for conventional BP; P = 0.0002; 122, 123, 124, and 124 mm Hg for 24-hour BP, P = 0.0001). In multivariable linear regression analyses, the β estimates for systolic BP per 1-unit increase in log transformed hs-cTnI were 2.52 for conventional BP (P = 0.0001); 2.75 for 24-hour BP (P < 0.0001); 2.71 and 2.41 (P < 0.0001 and P = 0.0002) for day and nighttime BP, respectively. There was a significant relationship between hs-cTnI and the Sokolow-Lyon Index (odds ratio (95% confidence interval): 2.09 (1.37; 3.18), P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Using a hs assay, hs-cTnI was detectable in virtually all participants of a young and healthy population. hs-cTnI was independently associated with systolic BP and left ventricular hypertrophy.",
