  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the responsiveness of one measure of HRQL, the HUI Mark 2 (HUI2), to changes in health status over time in an older community-based population. METHODS: The sample consisted of 192 individuals age 65 and over residing in their homes and receiving health and support services in Calgary, Canada. Subjects received three assessments at 6-month intervals using the HUI2, to measure health-related quality of life (HRQL), and the Minimum Data Set for Home Care (MDS-HC) for demographic and health status information. Change scores were calculated as the difference between scores at the second and third assessments. The relationship between the HUI2 and other measures of health status were examined using t-tests and ANOVA. Associations between the magnitude of decline in HUI2 and declines on other measures were examined using multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Lower HUI2 scores were significantly associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, impairment in activities of daily living (ADL), and clinical instability at baseline. Over 6 months of follow-up, HUI2 decline was associated with worsening depressive symptoms, increase in the number of chronic conditions, and age 85 and over. CONCLUSION: The HUI2 measure of HRQL in older persons at risk for institutionalization appears to reflect health status at a point in time and to be responsive to changes in health status over time.",
