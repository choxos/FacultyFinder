  "title": "6-shogaol against 3-Nitropropionic acid-induced Huntington's disease in rodents: Based on molecular docking/targeting pro-inflammatory cytokines/NF-κB-BDNF-Nrf2 pathway.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an extremely harmful autosomal inherited neurodegenerative disease. Motor dysfunction, mental disorder, and cognitive deficits are the characteristic features of this disease. The current study examined whether 6-shogaol has a protective effect against 3-Nitropropionic Acid (3-NPA)-induced HD in rats. METHODS: A total of thirty male Wistar rats received 6-shogaol (10 and 20 mg/kg, per oral) an hour before injection of 3-NPA (10 mg/kg i.p.) for 15 days. Behavioral tests were performed, including narrow beam walk, rotarod test, and grip strength test. Biochemical tests promoting oxidative stress were evaluated [superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA)], including changes to neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), homovanillic acid (HVA), (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). The 6-shogaol was docked to the active site of TNF-α (2AZ5), NF-κB (1SVC), BDNF) [1B8M], and Nrf2 [5FZN] proteins using AutoDock tools. RESULTS: The 6-shogaol group significantly improved behavioral activity over the 3-NPA-injected control rats. Moreover, 3-NPA-induced significantly altered neurotransmitters, biochemical and neuroinflammatory indices, which could efficiently be reversed by 6-shogaol. The 6-shogaol showed favorable negative binding energies at -9.271 (BDNF) kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of 6-shogaol in an experimental animal paradigm against 3-NPA-induced HD in rats. The suggested mechanism is supported by immunohistochemical analysis and western blots, although more research is necessary for definite confirmation.",
