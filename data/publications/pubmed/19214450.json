  "title": "Triple coronary artery bypass graft in a 10-year-old child with familial hypercholesterolemia.",
  "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. The homozygous type of the disease is rare and causes tendon xanthomas and coronary artery disease during the early years of life. Herein we present a 10-year-old child with familial hypercholesterolemia who had three-vessel disease and was a candidate for liver transplantation. To the best of our knowledge, he is one of the youngest such patients reported in the English-language literature who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery.",
