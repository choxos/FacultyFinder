  "title": "Dual-Band Passive Beam Steering Antenna Technologies for Satellite Communication and Modern Wireless Systems: A Review.",
  "abstract": "Efficient beam steerable high-gain antennas enable high-speed data rates over long-distance networks, including wireless backhaul, satellite communications (SATCOM), and SATCOM On-the-Move. These characteristics are essential for advancing contemporary wireless communication networks, particularly within 5G and beyond. Various beam steering solutions have been proposed in the literature, with passive beam steering mechanisms employing planar metasurfaces emerging as cost-effective, power-efficient, and compact options. These attributes make them well-suited for use in confined spaces, large-scale production and widespread distribution to meet the demands of the mass market. Utilizing a dual-band antenna terminal setup is often advantageous for full duplex communication in wireless systems. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive review of the dual-band beam steering techniques for enabling full-duplex communication in modern wireless systems, highlighting their design methodologies, scanning mechanisms, physical characteristics, and constraints. Despite the advantages of planar metasurface-based beam steering solutions, the literature on dual-band beam steering antennas supporting full duplex communication is limited. This review article identifies research gaps and outlines future directions for developing economically feasible passive dual-band beam steering solutions for mass deployment.",
