  "title": "Counseling About Cannabis Use During Pregnancy and Lactation: A Qualitative Study of Patient and Clinician Perspectives.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Legalization in many jurisdictions has increased the prevalence of cannabis use, including during pregnancy and lactation. Accordingly, clinicians providing perinatal and infant care are increasingly required to counsel about this topic, even if they do not feel comfortable or prepared for this conversation. The aim of this research was to explore how prenatal clinicians and pregnant and lactating women interact with cannabis consumption. METHODS: Using qualitative description, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 75 individuals in Canada: 23 clinicians who provide pregnancy and lactation care, and 52 individuals who made cannabis consumption decisions during pregnancy and/or lactation. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. RESULTS: Three phases of the clinical encounter influenced decision-making about cannabis consumption: initiation of a discussion about cannabis, sense-making, and the outcome of the encounter. Patients and clinicians described similar ideals for a counseling encounter about cannabis consumption during pregnancy or lactation: open, patient-centered conversation grounded in an informed decision-making model to explore the benefits, risks, and alternatives to cannabis. While clinicians described these values as reflecting real clinical interactions, patients reported that in their experience, actual interactions did not live up to these ideals. CONCLUSION: Clinicians and pregnant and lactating people report desiring the same things from a counseling interaction about cannabis: sharing of information, identification of values, and facilitation of a decision. Both groups endorse an open, nonjudgemental counseling approach that explores the reasons why a patient is considering cannabis consumption and reflects these reasons against available evidence and alternatives known to be safe.",
