  "title": "Association of Intercostal Nerve Cryoablation During Nuss Procedure With Complications and Costs.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intercostal nerve cryoablation with the Nuss procedure has been shown to decrease opioid requirements and hospital length of stay; however, few studies have evaluated the impact on complications and hospital costs. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed for all Nuss procedures at our institution from 2016 through 2020. Outcomes were compared across 4 pain modalities: cryoablation with standardized pain regimen (n = 98), patient-controlled analgesia (PCA; n = 96), epidural (n = 36), and PCA with peripheral nerve block (PNB; n = 35). Outcomes collected included length of stay, opioid use, variable direct costs, and postoperative complications. Univariate and multivariate hierarchical regression analysis was used to compare outcomes between the pain modalities. RESULTS: Cryoablation was associated with increased total hospital cost compared with PCA (cryoablation, $11 145; PCA, $8975; P < .01), but not when compared with epidural ($9678) or PCA with PNB ($10 303). The primary driver for increased costs was operating room supplies (PCA, $2741; epidural, $2767; PCA with PNB, $3157; and cryoablation, $5938; P < .01). With multivariate analysis, cryoablation was associated with decreased length of stay (-1.94; 95% CI, -2.30 to -1.57), opioid use during hospitalization (-3.54; 95% CI, -4.81 to -2.28), and urinary retention (0.13; 95% CI, 0.05-0.35). CONCLUSIONS: Cryoablation significantly reduces opioid requirements and length of stay relative to alternative modalities, but it was associated with an increase in total hospital costs relative to PCA, but not epidural or PCA with PNB. Cryoablation was not associated with allodynia or slipped bars requiring reoperation.",
