  "title": "Use of noninvasive high-frequency ventilation in the neonatal intensive care unit: a retrospective review.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of the article is to review the effectiveness of neonatal noninvasive high-frequency ventilation (NIHFV) in preventing endotracheal mechanical ventilation. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series including all 79 instances of NIHFV use at four participating centers between July 2010 and September 2012. RESULTS: In 73% of cases, NIHFV was used as rescue after another noninvasive mode, and prophylactically (postextubation) in the remainder. In 58% of cases, infants transitioned to another noninvasive mode, without requiring intubation. There were significant reductions in the mean (SD) number of apneas, bradycardias, or desaturations (over 6 hours) (3.2 [0.4] vs. 1.2 [0.3]; p < 0.001), FiO2 (48 [3] vs. 40 [2]%; p < 0.001) and CO2 levels (74 [6] vs. 62 [4] mm Hg; p = 0.025] with NIHFV. No NIHFV-related complications were noted. CONCLUSIONS: NIHFV is a promising NIV mode that may help prevent or delay intubation and deserves further clinical research.",
