  "title": "Drosophila transcriptomics with and without ageing.",
  "abstract": "The genomic basis of ageing still remains unknown despite being a topic of study for many years. Here, we present data from 20 experimentally evolved laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster that have undergone two different life-history selection regimes. One set of ten populations demonstrates early ageing whereas the other set of ten populations shows postponed ageing. Additionally, both types of populations consist of five long standing populations and five recently derived populations. Our primary goal was to determine which genes exhibit changes in expression levels by comparing the female transcriptome of the two population sets at two different time points. Using three different sets of increasingly restrictive criteria, we found that 2.1-15.7% (82-629 genes) of the expressed genes are associated with differential ageing between population sets. Conversely, a comparison of recently derived populations to long-standing populations reveals little to no transcriptome differentiation, suggesting that the recent selection regime has had a larger impact on the transcriptome than its more distant evolutionary history. In addition, we found very little evidence for significant enrichment for functional attributes regardless of the set of criteria used. Relative to previous ageing studies, we find little overlap with other lists of aging related genes. The disparity between our results and previously published results is likely due to the high replication used in this study coupled with our use of highly differentiated populations. Our results reinforce the notion that the use of genomic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic data to uncover the genetic basis of a complex trait like ageing can benefit from experimental designs that use highly replicated, experimentally-evolved populations.",
