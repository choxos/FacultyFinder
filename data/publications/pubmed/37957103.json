  "title": "Transcystic Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration for Pediatric Patients with Choledocholithiasis: A Multi-Center Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with choledocholithiasis are often treated with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) followed by laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). Upfront LC, intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC), and possible transcystic laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) could potentially avoid the need for ERCP. We hypothesized that upfront LC + IOC ± LCBDE will decrease length of stay (LOS) and the total number of interventions for children with suspected choledocholithiasis. METHODS: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study was performed on pediatric patients (<18 years) between 2018 and 2022 with suspected choledocholithiasis. Demographic and clinical data were compared for upfront LC + IOC ± LCBDE and possible postoperative ERCP (OR1st) versus preoperative ERCP prior to LC (OR2nd). Complications were defined as postoperative pancreatitis, recurrent choledocholithiasis, bleeding, or abscess. RESULTS: Across four centers, 252 children with suspected choledocholithiasis were treated with OR1st (n = 156) or OR2nd (n = 96). There were no differences in age, gender, or body mass index. Of the LCBDE patients (72/156), 86% had definitive intraoperative management with the remaining 14% requiring postoperative ERCP. Complications were fewer and LOS was shorter with OR1st (3/156 vs. 15/96; 2.39 vs 3.84 days, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Upfront LC + IOC ± LCBDE for children with choledocholithiasis is associated with fewer ERCPs, lower LOS, and decreased complications. Postoperative ERCP remains an essential adjunct for patients who fail LCBDE. Further educational efforts are needed to increase the skill level for IOC and LCBDE in pediatric patients with suspected choledocholithiasis. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",
