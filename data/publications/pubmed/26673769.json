  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To assess the psychometrics of the French language Quality of Prenatal Care Questionnaire (QPCQ). METHODS: Data from 302 women were used in a confirmatory factor analysis and in assessment of construct validity through hypothesis testing and internal consistency reliability using Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS: The 6 factors (subscales) were verified and confirmed. Hypothesis testing further supported construct validity. The overall QPCQ had acceptable internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .97) as did 5 subscales (Cronbach's alpha = .70-.92); the Sufficient Time subscale had poorer reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .61). CONCLUSIONS: The French language QPCQ is a valid and reliable self-report measure of prenatal care quality. It can be used in research and in quality improvement work to strengthen prenatal care services.",
