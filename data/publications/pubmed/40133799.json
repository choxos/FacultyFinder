  "title": "JUMPSTART: evaluation of an early mobilization program following transcatheter aortic valve replacement.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with aortic stenosis undergoing a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are typically discharged from hospital the next day, leaving little time to support their mobilization needs. Therefore, to improve the early mobilization of post-TAVR patients, we investigated the adoption and acceptability of a self-directed, tailored and home-based exercise program (JUMPSTART), which consists of four exercise modules, available in virtual and paper formats. METHODS: This prospective, observational, non-randomized and comparative study was conducted at one regional cardiac centre in Ontario, Canada. The development of the JUMPSTART program was informed by the Knowledge-to-Action Cycle and the choice of study outcomes were guided by the RE-AIM Framework. Program adoption and acceptability were captured through two follow-up surveys, 14-days and three-months post-TAVR; survey questions were informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. The target program adoption rate was 70% by three-months post-TAVR. Impact of program participation on quality-of-life scores, and study participants' cardiac rehabilitation attendance, were also assessed. RESULTS: There were 144 study participants. Survey response rates were 86% at 14-days post-TAVR, and 78% at three-months post-TAVR. The program adoption rate was 75% while the cardiac rehabilitation attendance rate was 30%. Approximately 70% of participants preferred the paper-based program format. The technological requirement was the most common barrier to engaging with virtual formats. Most (70%) rated the exercises as being the right level of difficulty. There were no reports of major health or safety concerns while exercising. Quality-of-life scores significantly increased from baseline to three-months post-TAVR; however, this could not be attributed to frequency of program participation. Furthermore, 73% of program participants felt that their recovery was improved because of their participation in the program, and 96% reported that they would recommend it to others. The study team regularly reviewed preliminary findings and took action to improve the program and the implementation process. CONCLUSIONS: Participants were satisfied with the JUMPSTART program, which will continue to be offered to post-TAVR patients. Despite the increasing use of virtual technologies, most of this patient population prefers paper-based resources. Future planning will involve developing additional modules and exploring ways to increase program adoption, as well as cardiac rehabilitation attendance. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: Not applicable.",
