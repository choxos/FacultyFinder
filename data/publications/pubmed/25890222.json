  "title": "Genomic profiling guides the choice of molecular targeted therapy of pancreatic cancer.",
  "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has the worst five-year survival rate of all malignancies due to its aggressive progression and resistance to therapy. Current therapies are limited to gemcitabine-based chemotherapeutics, surgery, and radiation. The current trend toward \"personalized genomic medicine\" has the potential to improve the treatment options for pancreatic cancer. Gene identification and genetic alterations like single nucleotide polymorphisms and mutations will allow physicians to predict the efficacy and toxicity of drugs, which could help diagnose pancreatic cancer, guide neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment, and evaluate patients' prognosis. This article reviews the multifaceted roles of genomics and pharmacogenomics in pancreatic cancer.",
