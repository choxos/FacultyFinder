  "abstract": "The on-chip nano-integration of large-scale optical phased arrays (OPAs) is a development trend. However, the current scale of integrated OPAs is not large because of the limitations imposed by the lateral dimensions of beam-splitting structures. Here, we propose an ultra-compact and broadband OPA beam-splitting scheme with a nano-inverse design. We employed a staged design to obtain a T-branch with a wavelength bandwidth of 500 nm (1300-1800 nm) and an insertion loss of -0.2 dB. Owing to the high scalability and width-preserving characteristics, the cascaded T-branch configuration can significantly reduce the lateral dimensions of an OPA, offering a potential solution for the on-chip integration of a large-scale OPA. Based on three-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D FDTD) simulations, we demonstrated a 1 × 16 OPA beam-splitter structure composed entirely of inverse-designed elements with a lateral dimension of only 27.3 μm. Additionally, based on the constructed grating couplers, we simulated the range of the diffraction angle θ for the OPA, which varied by 0.6°-41.6° within the wavelength range of 1370-1600 nm.",
