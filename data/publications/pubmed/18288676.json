  "title": "Determination of tripdiolide in root extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii by solid-phase extraction and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography.",
  "abstract": "Extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. have been widely used in China to treat a variety of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. The diterpenoids triptolide and tripdiolide are two major active components in the T. wilfordii ethyl acetate extract. An efficient solid-phase extraction and high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC) method to measure triptolide content in the extract has been previously reported. However, a suitable means of tripdiolide quantification is not available because of interfering compounds in the extract that co-elute with tripdiolide. Therefore, this paper describes a method wherein tripdiolide content can be measured from a small amount of the extract. The extract solution (600 microL) was applied into an aminopropyl SPE tube. Triptolide was eluted with dichloromethane:methanol (1 mL, 49:1 v/v), followed by tripdiolide elution with dichloromethane:methanol (3 mL, 17:3 v/v). The tripdiolide eluate was analysed by HPLC using an isocratic solvent system and was quantified by measuring the peak area at 219 nm. The contents of triptolide and tripdiolide in the extract were determined to be 807.32 +/- 51.94 and 366.13 +/- 17.21 microg/g of extract, respectively. Since tripdiolide is biologically active and makes up a considerable portion of the extract, for extract quality control and standardisation purposes, it should be measured along with triptolide using the proposed SPE-HPLC method.",
