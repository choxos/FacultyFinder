  "title": "Systematic Review of Women Leading and Participating in Nephrology Randomized Clinical Trials.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Women are underrepresented in the leadership of and participation in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We conducted a bibliometric review of nephrology RCTs to examine trial leadership by women and participation of women in nephrology RCTs. METHODS: A bibliometric review of RCTs published in top medical, surgical, or nephrology journals was conducted using MEDLINE and EMBASE from January 2011 to December 2021. Leadership by women as corresponding authors, women trial participation, and trial characteristics were examined with duplicate independent data extraction. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between trial characteristics and women leadership and trial participation. RESULTS: A total of 1770 studies were screened and 395 RCTs met eligibility criteria. The number (%) of women in corresponding, first, and last authorship positions were as follows: 89 (22%), 109 (28%), and 74 (19%), respectively, without change over time (P = 0.94). The median percentage (interquartile range [IQR]) of women trial participants was 39.0% (13.5%) with no difference between women or men lead authors (P = 0.15). Men lead authors were statistically less likely to enroll women in RCTs. Women lead authors were less likely to be funded by industry (odds ratio [OR]: 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.14-0.63; P = 0.002) or lead international trials (OR: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.01-0.83; P = 0.03). Trials with sex-specific eligibility criteria were more likely to have women leaders (OR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.19-5.49; P = 0.02) than those without. DISCUSSION: Gender inequalities in RCT leadership and RCT participation exist in nephrology and did not improve over time. Strategies to improve inequalities need to be implemented and evaluated.",
