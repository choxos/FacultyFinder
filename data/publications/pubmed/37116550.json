  "title": "Outcomes After Hip Arthroscopy Show No Differences Between Sexes: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess differences in postoperative outcomes between male and female patients following hip arthroscopy. METHODS: A systematic review was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Medline, Embase, Cochrane, and PubMed databases were searched. Key words included \"hip,\" \"arthroscopy,\" \"outcome,\" \"gender difference,\" \"sex difference,\" \"gender,\" and \"patient-reported outcome.\" Studies were included that reported sex-specific analysis of outcomes following primary hip arthroscopy with minimum 2-year follow-up. Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies criteria were applied to each study. Data collected included patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), complications, rates of revision arthroscopy (RA), and conversion to total hip arthroplasty (THA). Forest plots were generated for the most frequently reported PROMs, RA, and THA rates. RESULTS: In total, 38 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 40,194 (57% female) hips included. The most common indications for hip arthroscopy were femoroacetabular impingement and labral tears. Eighteen studies reported PROMs, with no clear trend towards sex differences. Eleven studies reported on RA rates, with 4 showing a significantly greater rate of RA in female patients. Seventeen studies reported on conversion to THA, with an overall conversion rate of 9.64%. There were no clear sex differences in conversion to THA. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between sexes for postoperative PROM scores. Male patients were less likely to reach the MCID for the HOS-SSS than female patients in the majority of studies, and there were no sex differences for PASS rates. There were no significant differences between sexes in revision arthroscopy rates and conversion to total hip arthroplasty. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, systematic review of Level II, III and IV studies.",
