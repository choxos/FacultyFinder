  "title": "Pulmonary rehabilitation with balance training for fall reduction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Available evidence suggests that adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) performed substantially worse than healthy controls on many balance measures and balance training can improve the balance measures in this population. We conducted this study to determine the effects of incorporating balance training into pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on the incidence of falls at 12 months follow-up in high fall risk adults with COPD. METHODS: We conducted a prospective international multi-center randomized controlled trial. Eligible participants were adults with COPD at a high risk of future falls and were randomly assigned (1:1) to the intervention or control group. The intervention included personalized balance training for a targeted total of 90 min per week. Both the intervention and control groups received usual PR (2-3 times per week for 8-12 weeks). The primary outcome was the incidence of falls at 12-month follow-up using monthly fall diary calendars. Negative binomial regression or recurrent events models were used to examine the effects of the intervention on fall events. Multiple imputations were performed to deal with missing values. RESULTS: Of 258 participants who were enrolled in the trial, 178 provided falls information (intervention group = 91, control group = 87) and were included in the main analysis. Forty-one participants (45%) experienced at least one fall event in the intervention group and 33 (38%) in the control group (p = 0.34). The mean incidence of falls at 12 months was similar between the two groups (128 versus 128 per 100 person-years; mean difference: 0.30, 95% CI: -0.76 to 1.36 per 100 person-years). The results are robust after multiple imputations for missing data (n = 67). CONCLUSIONS: PR incorporating balance training compared to PR alone did not reduce the incidence of falls over the 12-month period in high fall risk adults with COPD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02995681) on 14/12/2016.",
