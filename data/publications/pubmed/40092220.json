  "title": "Probiotics and Synbiotics: Applications, Benefits, and Mechanisms for the Improvement of Human and Ecological Health.",
  "abstract": "This review explores the multifaceted roles and applications of probiotics, emphasizing their significance in maintaining and enhancing host health through microbial interactions. It includes the concept of holobionts and the symbiotic relationships between hosts and their microbiomes, illustrating how various microbiota can enhance immunity, support growth, and prevent diseases. It delves into the customization of probiotics using molecular and genomic techniques, focusing Enterococcus, Bifidobacterium, and Lactobacillus species. Furthermore, it discusses the symbiotic effects of symbiotics which aids in enhancing the survivability and beneficial effects of probiotics. The role beneficial microbes in gut is emphasized, noting its impact on preventing diseases and maintaining a stable microbial community. The potential therapeutic value of probiotics includes the ability to treat gastrointestinal diseases, as well as to strengthen the immune system and reduce the number of free radicals that are present in the body. Additionally, it explores secondary metabolites produced by bacteria in the gut, such as bacteriocins and exopolysaccharides, and their effect on the health of human, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. The review concludes by addressing the use of probiotics in traditional medicine and their potential in novel therapeutic applications, including the treatment of endangered wildlife species and various human ailments.",
