  "title": "Hypofractionated Stereotactic Radiotherapy for the Treatment of Benign Intracranial Meningiomas: Long-Term Safety and Efficacy.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (hSRT) has emerged as an alternative to single-fraction stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for the treatment of intracranial meningiomas (ICMs). However, there is a need for data showing long-term efficacy and complication rates, particularly for larger tumors in sensitive locations. METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on adult patients with ICMs seen at a tertiary care center. Eligible patients were treated with the CyberKnife platform and had a planned treatment course of 3-5 fractions from 2011-2020. The local control was assessed based on radiographic stability and the late toxicity/radionecrosis rates were recorded. Radiographic progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: In total, 62 patients (age 26-87) with 67 treated tumors were included in this study with a median follow-up of 64.7 months. RT was delivered as the primary treatment in 62.7% of cases and for recurrence in 37.3%. The most common tumor locations were the convexity of the brain and the base of the skull. The tumor sizes ranged from 0.1-51.8 cc and the median planning target volume was 4.9 cc. The most common treatment schedule was 18 Gy in 3 fractions. The five-year PFS and OS were 85.2% and 91.0%, respectively. The late grade III/IV toxicity rate was 3.2% and the radionecrosis rate was 4.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our data, hSRT remains an effective modality to treat low-grade ICMs with acceptable long-term toxicity and radionecrosis rates. hSRT should be offered to patients who are not ideal candidates for SRS while preserving the benefits of hypofractionation.",
