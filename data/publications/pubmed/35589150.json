  "title": "Taking stock of global commitments on antimicrobial resistance.",
  "abstract": "Over the last six years, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has generated an unprecedented amount of global attention. This global attention has coincided with an increase in discussion around AMR at various multilateral organisations and international fora. This study catalogues and analyses AMR-related commitments made by the global community following the implementation of the AMR Tripartite's Global Action Plan (GAP) in 2015. In examining these commitments, we elucidated emergent themes and gaps in AMR discourse through a qualitative content analysis of global political resolutions, declarations and statements made by members of the United Nations, the World Health Assembly, Food and Agriculture Organization Conferences, World Organisation for Animal Health General Sessions, and the G7 and G20 summits and ministerial meetings between the years 2015 and 2021. Emergent themes included AMR research, surveillance and stewardship. Across sectors, fewer commitments were made for specific action on AMR in the environment. The themes and types of commitments were found to be consistent across time and fora but did not evolve into more concrete or nuanced pledges to action between 2015 and 2021. GAP objectives relating to infection prevention and efforts to address the root drivers of AMR appeared the least frequently in our analysis, indicating a lack of global commitment to take a proactive prevention-focused approach to AMR.",
