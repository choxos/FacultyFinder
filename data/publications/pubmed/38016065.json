  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To quantify inconsistent self-reporting of chronic conditions between the baseline (2011-2015) and first follow-up surveys (2015-2018) in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), and to explore methods to resolve inconsistent responses and impact on multimorbidity. METHODS: Community-dwelling adults aged 45-85 years in the baseline and first follow-up surveys were included (n = 45,184). At each survey, participants self-reported whether they ever had a physician diagnosis of 35 chronic conditions. Identifiable inconsistent responses were enumerated. RESULTS: 32-40% of participants had at least one inconsistent response across all conditions. Illness-related information (e.g., taking medication) resolved most inconsistent responses (>93%) while computer-assisted software asking participants to confirm their inconsistent disease status resolved ≤53%. Using these adjudication methods, multimorbidity prevalence at follow-up increased by ≤1.6% compared to the prevalence without resolving inconsistent responses. DISCUSSION: Inconsistent self-reporting of chronic conditions is common but may not substantially affect multimorbidity prevalence. Future research should validate methods to resolve inconsistencies.",
