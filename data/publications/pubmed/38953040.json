  "title": "Comparison of COVID-19 Hospitalization and Death Between Solid Organ Transplant Recipients and the General Population in Canada, 2020-2022.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplant recipients have a high risk of severe outcomes from SARS-CoV-2 infection. A comprehensive understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple waves in the solid organ transplant population and how this compares to the general population is limited. We conducted a population-based cohort study using linked administrative healthcare databases from Ontario, Canada to answer this question. METHODS: We included 15 306 solid organ transplant recipients and 12 160 904 individuals from the general population. Our primary outcome was the rate (per 100 person-years) of severe COVID-19 (ie, hospitalization or death with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test) occurring between January 25, 2020, and November 30, 2022. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, solid organ transplant recipients had almost a 6 times higher rate of severe COVID-19 (20.39 versus 3.44 per 100 person-years), with almost 5.5 times as high a rate of death alone (4.19 versus 0.77 per 100 person-years). Transplant recipients with severe COVID-19 were substantially younger (60.1 versus 66.5 y) and had more comorbidities. The rate of severe COVID-19 declined over time in the solid organ transplant population, with an incidence rate of 41.25 per 100 person-years in the first wave (January 25, 2020, to August 31, 2020) and 18.41 in the seventh wave (June 19, 2022, to November 30, 2022, Omicron era). CONCLUSIONS: Solid organ transplant recipients remain at high risk of severe outcomes when they are infected with SARS-CoV-2. Resources and strategies to mitigate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 exposure are needed in this vulnerable patient population.",
