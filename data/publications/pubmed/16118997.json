  "abstract": "56 year-old male presented to the University of Mississippi Medical Center emergency department (ED) with complaints of progressive shortness of breath, productive cough, fever, and malaise. His past medical history was significant for hypertension as well as a 60 pack-year history of smoking. Upon arrival to the ED he had a temperature of 103.6 degrees F, blood pressure of 80/40 mm Hg, a pulse of 110 beats per minute, respirations of 28 per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 50% on room air. He appeared to be in significant respiratory distress. Lung examination revealed diffuse bilateral rhonchi and wheezes in all lung fields. He was emergently intubated. Chest radiograph demonstrated a miliary pattern scattered throughout all lung fields in addition to parenchymal opacities. A complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 33,500 10(3)/microL, hematocrit of 37%, and platelets of 906,000 10(3)/uL. Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine were 27 mg/dL and 1.0 mg/dL, respectively. Initial ABG on 100% oxygen showed pH 7.15, pCO2 82 mm Hg, and pO2 62 mm Hg. Troponin I was negative. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Blood and urine cultures were obtained.",
