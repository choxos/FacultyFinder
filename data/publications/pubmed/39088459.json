  "title": "Patient satisfaction with the management of refractory and unexplained chronic cough in Canada: Results from a national survey.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic cough (persisting for ≥8 weeks) is a common disorder affecting approximately 5 to 10% of adults worldwide that is sometimes refractory to treatment (refractory chronic cough [RCC]) or has no identifiable cause (unexplained chronic cough [UCC]). There is minimal information on the patient's experience of RCC/UCC in Canada. The aim of this study was to evaluate the patient journey and perceptions related to RCC/UCC management in Canada. METHODS: Our exploratory study included Canadians in the Leger Opinion Panel and focused on individuals with RCC or UCC. Key entry criteria were: age ≥18 years, cough on most days for ≥8 weeks, no smoking within 1 year, no serious respiratory disease or lung cancer, and not taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Individuals who met entry criteria were invited to complete an approximately 30-minute online survey with questions on demographic characteristics, healthcare professional (HCP) interactions, diagnosis of underlying conditions, current treatments, and satisfaction with HCPs and chronic cough therapies. RESULTS: A total of 49,076 individuals completed the chronic cough screening questionnaire (July 30, 2021 to September 1, 2021): 1,620 (3.3%) met entry criteria for RCC or UCC, and 1,046 (2.1%) completed the online survey (mean age of 45 years, 61% female). Most respondents (58%) reported their chronic cough was managed by a general practitioner (GP). Forty-four percent of respondents did not have a diagnosis of an underlying condition for their cough. Breathing tests (39%) and chest imaging (34%) were the most common diagnostic tests. Cough suppressants (18%) were the most frequent current treatment. Respondents were moderately satisfied with their HCPs, but more than half considered their treatment ineffective and 34% had considered no longer seeking medical attention because of a lack of treatment success. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with RCC/UCC in Canada are largely unsatisfied with the effectiveness of treatment. Additional HCP education and new treatment options are needed to improve patient satisfaction.",
