  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adults receiving preemptive renal transplants have better allograft survival. Our study investigated differences in graft and patient survival based on need for, and duration of, pretransplant dialysis in pediatric renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Data on pediatric kidney transplants from January 1995 to December 2000 from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network were included. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed to determine the effect of pretransplant dialysis on graft and patient survival. RESULTS: Of 3606 transplants, 28% were preemptive, 38% followed pretransplant hemodialysis (HD), and 34% peritoneal dialysis (PD). The 1-year acute rejection rate was lowest for the preemptive group (36%) compared with the HD (45.5%; P=0.0002) and PD (44.2%; P=0.0008) groups. On multivariable analysis, an increased relative risk of graft failure was seen with, among other variables, deceased donor transplantation and acute rejection within the first year, but not with pretransplant dialysis. When analyzed separately by donor source, pretransplant dialysis had no effect on graft survival for deceased donor graft recipients, whereas for living donor recipients, the use and duration of pretransplant HD adversely affected pediatric renal graft survival in a linear manner. No such effect was seen with pretransplant PD. CONCLUSIONS: There is a linear increase in the risk of graft failure with the use of and increasing duration of pretransplant HD for living donor grafts. This indicates another reason to minimize the need for and duration of pretransplant HD in children with chronic kidney disease.",
