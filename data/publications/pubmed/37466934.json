  "title": "Incidence and Prevalence of Diagnosed Vitiligo According to Race and Ethnicity, Age, and Sex in the US.",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Vitiligo has substantial psychosocial consequences. Yet its burden is poorly established. OBJECTIVE: To estimate incidence and prevalence of diagnosed vitiligo across age, sex, and racial and ethnic subgroups in the US. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis comprising a cohort study and cross-sectional study included electronic health records for health care-seeking children, adolescents, and adults across 4 US census regions. Data for the incidence analysis were obtained from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2019, and data for the prevalence analysis were obtained from January 1 through December 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from December 13, 2022, to June 8, 2023. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were incidence (per 100 000 person-years [PY]) and prevalence of diagnosed vitiligo overall and by age, race and ethnicity, and sex. RESULTS: A total of 2 980 778 patients with vitiligo were included in the incidence analysis (mean [SD] age, 41.5 [24.0] years; 57.0% female; 1.4% Asian American; 12.9% Black; 1.5% Hispanic/Latino; 77.3% White; 6.9% other or multiracial) and 1 057 534 in the prevalence analysis (mean [SD] age, 43.4 [24.7] years; 57.5% female; 1.7% Asian American, 14.7% Black, 1.4% Hispanic/Latino; 75.7% White; 6.6% other or multiracial). Age- and sex-adjusted overall incidence rate (IR) of diagnosed vitiligo was 22.6 per 100 000 PY (95% CI, 21.5-23.8 per 100 000 PY), and prevalence was 0.16% (95% CI, 0.15%-0.17%). Sex-adjusted IR was highest among patients aged 60 to 69 years (25.3 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 22.2-28.6 per 100 000 PY), and prevalence was highest among patients aged 70 years or older (0.21%; 95% CI, 0.19%-0.23%). The highest age-adjusted IR was observed among Asian American patients (41.2 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 28.2-58.2 per 100 000 PY), followed by Hispanic/Latino patients (37.3 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 25.7-52.4 per 100 000 PY), patients reporting other or multiple races (31.1 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 25.9-37.1 per 100 000 PY), Black patients (29.6 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 26.0-33.6 per 100 000 PY), and White patients (18.7 per 100 000 PY; 95% CI, 17.5-20.0 per 100 000 PY). The highest age-adjusted prevalence was observed among Hispanic/Latino patients (0.29%; 95% CI, 0.20%-0.39%), followed by Asian American patients (0.27%; 95% CI, 0.19%-0.35%), patients reporting other or multiple races (0.24%; 95% CI, 0.20%-0.28%), Black patients (0.22%; 95% CI, 0.19%-0.24%), and White patients (0.13%; 95% CI, 0.12%-0.14%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional study found that vitiligo diagnosis was more common in older patients, Hispanic/Latino patients, and Asian American patients.",
