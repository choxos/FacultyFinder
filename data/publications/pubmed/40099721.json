  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The primary aim was to investigate the relationship between serum growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF15) levels and non-motor symptom (NMS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. The secondary aim was to explore the diagnostic value of GDF15 for specific NMS. METHODS: A total of 102 PD patients were enrolled in this study, including 47 males and 55 females. Doctors collected the clinical and demographic information of patients and detected the level of serum GDF15. Next, linear univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to assess the correlation between GDF15 and NMS. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to determine the optimal cut-off value of GDF15 and evaluate its diagnostic value. RESULTS: In PD patients, there was no significant difference in serum GDF15 levels between males and females (p = 0.831). Age of PD onset, pesticide use, depression, sexual dysfunction, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) were associated with serum GDF15. Serum GDF15 was negatively correlated with HAMD, depression and sexual dysfunction and positively correlated with ESS. Each 10 pg/ml increase in serum GDF15 levels was associated with a 4% lower risk of depression and a 5% lower risk of sexual dysfunction. Notably, serum GDF15 may be a biomarker for distinguishing depression and sexual dysfunction in PD patients. CONCLUSION: Elevated serum GDF15 reduced the risk of PD with depression and sexual dysfunction. Serum GDF15 may be a biomarker for distinguishing depression and sexual dysfunction in PD patients.",
