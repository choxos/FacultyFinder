  "abstract": "While primarily observed in adults, this case contributes valuable insights into the manifestation and management of this benign salivary gland tumor within the pediatric population. This paper reports the first documented case of sinonasal pleomorphic adenoma in pediatric otolaryngology, presenting a unique perspective on this rare nasal tumor in a 9-year-old boy. The patient presented with progressive nasal obstruction and epistaxis and underwent a smooth endoscopic resection of a 2-cm pleomorphic adenoma on the right anterior nasal septum. The subsequent discussion covered background, histology, imaging, and management strategies. Surgical removal with clear margins, particularly through the endoscopic approach, emerged as the primary and successful treatment method, minimizing morbidity and reducing recurrence risk. Long-term clinical surveillance is recommended due to an estimated 8.8% recurrence rate. In conclusion, this paper explains the challenges and solutions in diagnosing and treating sinonasal pleomorphic adenomas in children. It emphasizes the critical importance of early diagnosis, precise surgical intervention, and continuous monitoring, which are essential for achieving optimal patient outcomes.",
