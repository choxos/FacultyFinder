  "abstract": "Decrease in the titer of bacteriophage PRD1 (a model of animal adenoviruses) in aqueous solutions caused by the presence of systematically chemically derivatized surfaces was kinetically investigated. The greatest loss of infectivity--up to a 4-log reduction in the titer--was observed with immobilized hydrophobic polyethylenimine-based and dendrimer-based polycations.",
