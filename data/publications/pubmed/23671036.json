  "title": "Uridine adenosine tetraphosphate induces contraction of circular and longitudinal gastric smooth muscle by distinct signaling pathways.",
  "abstract": "Extracellular nucleotides uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP) and adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) induce contraction of gastric smooth muscle (SM). The dinucleotide uridine adenosine tetraphosphate (Up4 A), an endothelium-derived contraction factor, induces vascular SM contraction. Its effect on gastric SM contractions, however, is unknown. We addressed the hypothesis that Up4 A induces gastric SM contraction via a mechanism that may differ between circular and longitudinal muscle (CM and LM, respectively). CM and LM were isolated from rat gastric fundus for the measurement of isometric tension. Up4 A induced transient contractile responses in both CM and LM, which were similar to those induced by ATP and UTP. Up4 A failed to induce contraction of either LM or CM in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+) or in the presence of nimodipine, an inhibitor of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels. P2X1, 2, 4, 5 and 7 and P2Y1, 2, 4 and 6 receptor expression was detected in gastric SM by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. IP5 I (a P2X receptor antagonist) and α,β-methylene-ATP (a P2X receptor agonist) had no effect on Up4 A-induced contractions of either LM or CM, and α,β-methylene-ATP alone failed to induce a contractile response in either tissue. Suramin (a P2Y receptor antagonist), on the other hand, significantly inhibited Up4 A-induced contraction of CM, but not LM. Up4 A-induced contraction of CM, but not LM, was also inhibited by pretreatment with Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase. We conclude that Up4 A induces extracellular Ca(2+) -dependent contractions of rat gastric LM and CM, and Up4 A-induced contraction of CM is mediated by suramin-sensitive P2Y receptors and subsequent activation of the Rho-associated kinase pathway.",
