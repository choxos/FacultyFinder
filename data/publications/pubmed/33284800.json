  "title": "Assessment of antimalarial drug resistant markers in asymptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections after 4 years of indoor residual spraying in Northern Ghana.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Drug resistance remains a concern for malaria control and elimination. The effect of interventions on its prevalence needs to be monitored to pre-empt further selection. We assessed the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum gene mutations associated with resistance to the antimalarial drugs: sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), chloroquine (CQ) and artemisinin combination therapy (ACTs) after the scale-up of a vector control activity that reduced transmission. METHODS: A total of 400 P. falciparum isolates from children under five years were genotyped for seventeen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfdhfr, pfdhps and pfk13 genes using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high resolution melting (HRM) analysis. These included 80 isolates, each randomly selected from cross-sectional surveys of asymptomatic infections across 2010 (baseline), 2011, 2012, 2013 (midline: post-IRS) and 2014 (endline: post-IRS) during the peak transmission season, when IRS intervention was rolled out in Bunkpurugu Yunyoo (BY) District, Ghana. The proportions of isolates with drug resistant alleles were assessed over this period. RESULTS: There were significant decreases in the prevalence of pfdhfr- I51R59N108 haplotype from 2010 to 2014, while the decline in pfdhfr/pfdhps- I51R59N108G437 during the same period was not significant. The prevalence of lumefantrine (LM), mefloquine (MQ) and amodiaquine (AQ) resistance-associated haplotypes pfmdr1-N86F184D1246 and pfmdr1-Y86Y184Y1246 showed decreasing trends (z = -2.86, P = 0.004 and z = -2.71, P = 0.007, respectively). Each of pfcrt-T76 and pfmdr1-Y86 mutant alleles also showed a declining trend in the asymptomatic reservoir, after the IRS rollout in 2014 (z = -2.87, P = 0.004 and z = -2.65, P = 0.008, respectively). Similarly, Pyrimethamine resistance mediating polymorphisms pfdhfr-N108, pfdhfr-I51 and pfdhfr-R59 also declined (z = -2.03, P = 0.042, z = -3.54, P<0.001 and z = -4.63, P<0.001, respectively), but not the sulphadoxine resistance mediating pfdhps-G437 and pfdhps-F436 (z = -0.36, P = 0.715 and z = 0.41, P = 0.684, respectively). No mutant pfk13-Y580 were detected during the study period. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated declining trends in the prevalence of drug resistant mutations in asymptomatic P. falciparum infections following transmission reduction after an enhanced IRS intervention in Northern Ghana.",
