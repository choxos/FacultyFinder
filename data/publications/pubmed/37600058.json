  "title": "Mid-term changes in cognitive functions in patients with atrial fibrillation: a longitudinal analysis of the Swiss-AF cohort.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Longitudinal association studies of atrial fibrillation (AF) and cognitive functions have shown an unclear role of AF-type and often differ in methodological aspects. We therefore aim to investigate longitudinal changes in cognitive functions in association with AF-type (non-paroxysmal vs. paroxysmal) and comorbidities in the Swiss-AF cohort. METHODS: Seven cognitive measures were administered up to five times between 2014 and 2022. Age-education standardized scores were calculated and association between longitudinal change in scores and baseline AF-type investigated using linear mixed-effects models. Associations between AF-type and time to cognitive drop, an observed score of at least one standard deviation below individual's age-education standardized cognitive scores at baseline, were studied using Cox proportional hazard models of each cognitive test, censoring patients at their last measurement. Models were adjusted for baseline covariates. RESULTS: 2,415 AF patients (mean age 73.2 years; 1,080 paroxysmal, 1,335 non-paroxysmal AF) participated in this Swiss multicenter prospective cohort study. Mean cognitive scores increased longitudinally (median follow-up 3.97 years). Non-paroxysmal AF patients showed smaller longitudinal increases in Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Cognitive Construct Score (CoCo)and Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B) scores vs. paroxysmal AF patients. Diabetes, history of stroke/TIA and depression were associated with worse performance on all cognitive tests. No differences in time to cognitive drop were observed between AF-types in any cognitive test. CONCLUSION: This study indicated preserved cognitive functioning in AF patients, best explained by practice effects. Smaller practice effects were found in non-paroxysmal AF patients in the DSST, TMT-B and the CoCo and could indicate a marker of subtle cognitive decline. As diabetes, history of stroke/TIA and depression-but not AF-type-were associated with cognitive drop, more attention should be given to risk factors and underlying mechanisms of AF.",
