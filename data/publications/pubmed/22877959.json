  "title": "A mix of bulk and ready-to-use modified-texture food: impact on older adults requiring dysphagic food.",
  "abstract": "Ready-to-use modified-texture food (rMTF) products are commercially available and may have greater appeal than conventional in-house or commercial bulk modified-texture food (cMTF) products. A nine-month pilot study using a prospective interrupted time-series design where participants (n = 42) served as their own controls investigated the impact of cMTF + rMTF on weight goals, weight, food intake, and co-morbidity. Seventy-four per cent of participants achieved their weight goals at the end of six months on rMTF and, although insignificant, participants did have a trend towards weight gain while on rMTF (OR 3.5 p = .16). Main-plate food intake (grams) was not significantly different over time, but a downwards trajectory suggests decreased consumption that was compensated for by a significantly higher fat intake during the intervention period (p = .01). Increased co-morbidity and a decreasing volume of food consumed are common in older adults with dysphagia, and enhanced food products are needed to meet nutrient needs. Methodological issues encountered in this study can provide guidance for future work.",
