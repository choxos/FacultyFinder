  "abstract": "For adopting recently introduced hypertension phenotypes categorized using office and out of office blood pressure (BP) for the diagnosis of hypertension and antihypertension drug therapy, it is mandatory to define the corresponding out of office BP with the specific target BP recommended by the major guidelines. Such conditions include white-coat hypertension (WCH), masked hypertension (MH), white-coat uncontrolled hypertension (WUCH), and masked uncontrolled hypertension (MUCH). Here, the authors review the relevant literature and discuss the related issue to facilitate the use of corresponding BPs for proper diagnosis of WCH, MH, WUCH, and MUCH in the setting of standard target BP as well as intensive target BP. The methodology of deriving the corresponding BP has evolved from statistical methods such as standard deviation, percentile value, and regression to an outcome-based approach using pooled international cohort study data and comparative analysis in randomized clinical trials for target BPs such as the SPRINT and STEP studies. Corresponding BPs to 140/90 and 130/80 mm Hg in office BP is important for safe and strict achievement of intensive BP targets. The corresponding home, daytime, and 24-h BPs to 130/80 mm Hg in office BP are 130/80, 130/80, and 125/75 mm Hg, respectively. However, researchers have found some discrepancies among the home corresponding BPs. As tentative criterion for de-escalation of antihypertensive therapy as shown in European guidelines was 120 mm Hg in office BP, corresponding home, daytime, and 24-h systolic BPs to 120 mm Hg in office systolic BP are 120, 120, and 115 mm Hg, respectively.",
