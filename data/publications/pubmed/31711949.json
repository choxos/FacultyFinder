  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are few publications on revising sleeve gastrectomy (SG) to one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine outcomes in terms of weight loss and resolution of co-morbidities in patients who had SG revised to OAGB. SETTINGS: A high-volume university-affiliated bariatric surgery center in India. METHOD: Information was collected from patients identified in a prospectively maintained database of patients who had a revision from SG to OAGB. An analysis of outcomes in terms of weight loss and maintenance with up to 3-years follow-up is reported. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients were revised from SG to OAGB. Of the 32 revised patients, 9 (28%) had type 2 diabetes, 15 (47%) had hypertension, and 2 (6%) had sleep apnea at the time of the initial SG. At the time of revision only 2 of 32 (6.25%) had type 2 diabetes, 3 (9.4%) had hypertension, and none had sleep apnea. The average initial weight in this study before SG was 118 kg and body mass index was 44.04 kg/m[2]. The average weight at the nadir and at revision was 92.1 and 103.5 kg, respectively. Average weight was 93.5, 94.3, and 100.6 kg (P < .002) at 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow-up, respectively. There was reoccurrence of type 2 diabetes in 1 patient at 3 years after revision due to weight regain. There were no complications in this study. CONCLUSION: In this study, revision of SG to OAGB because of inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain was safe and effective at 2-year follow-up; however, there was a tendency toward weight regain at 3 years. Multicenter studies with larger series of patients and longer-term follow-up after SG revision to OAGB are needed.",
