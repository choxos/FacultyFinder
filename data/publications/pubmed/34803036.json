  "title": "Understanding Black Women's Perspectives and Experiences of Cervical Cancer Screening: A Systematic Review and Qualitative Meta-synthesis.",
  "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the third most common gynecological cancer. Effective population-based cervical cancer screening programs exist, but improvements in morbidity and mortality continue to demonstrate racial disparities. For example, Black women are 41% more likely to develop cervical cancer than White women and are 75% more likely to die from it. It is therefore important to understand whether these inequities in cervical cancer outcomes are related to differential access and uptake of screening programs. In this systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis, we used an intersectional lens to understand Black women's experiences and perspectives of cervical cancer screening (CCS). We identified 12 factors related to the perspectives and experiences of Black women participating in CCS. Understanding Black women's experiences and perspectives of CCS can help individual clinicians and policymakers implement CCS in a way that is culturally appropriate and cognizant of structural oppression.",
