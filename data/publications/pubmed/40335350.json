  "title": "Guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care in cesarean delivery: Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society recommendations (part 1)-2025 update.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery protocols include evidence-based interventions designed to improve patient experience, pregnancy, and neonatal outcomes while reducing healthcare-related costs. This is the first update of the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines for antenatal and preoperative care before cesarean delivery after the original publication in 2018. METHODS: Interventions were selected based on expert consensus using the Delphi method. An updated literature search was conducted in September 2024 using the Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, EBSCO CINAHL (Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Targeted searches were performed by a medical librarian to identify relevant articles published since the 2018 Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society guidelines publication, which evaluated each antenatal and preoperative enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery intervention, focusing on randomized clinical trials and large observational studies (â‰¥800 patients) to maximize search feasibility and relevance. Following a review of the evidence, a consensus was reached regarding the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendation for each proposed intervention according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. RESULTS: The 6 recommended enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery interventions are (1) antenatal pathway patient education for scheduled caesarean delivery (evidence low to very low, recommendation strong); (2) multidisciplinary medical and surgical staff education regarding enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery support, intervention implementation, and measurement (evidence low, recommendation strong); (3) optimization of the medical care for pregnant patients with comorbid conditions, such as anemia, obesity, hypertension, prepregnancy and gestational diabetes, smoking (tobacco, cannabis, vaping), congenital heart disease, epilepsy, autoimmune disease, and asthma (evidence moderate, recommendation strong); (4) abdominal skin preparation with chlorhexidine gluconate impregnated cloth (evening before scheduled cesarean delivery) (evidence moderate; recommendation weak); (5) the duration of preoperative fasting based on the content intake (evidence low, recommendation weak); (6) the use of a preoperative, nonparticulate carbohydrate drink (evidence low-moderate, recommendation strong). CONCLUSION: The first 3 recommendations are for use in the antenatal period (10-38 weeks of gestation), which allow for the optimization of patient comorbidities, whereas the remaining 3 recommendations are for preoperative interventions (skin preparation, preoperative fasting directives, and preoperative carbohydrate supplementation). Educational tools for cesarean delivery with well-designed shared decision-making focus on comorbidity management should be developed. These management tasks are viewed as routine care; however, the measurable success and impact have clinical variance. The enhanced recovery after cesarean delivery goal for patients who are undergoing a scheduled caesarean delivery is to maximize the quality of the pregnant patient's recovery and the fetal-neonatal outcome.",
