  "abstract": "Post-baccalaureate pre-medicine programs (PBPMP) provide prerequisite coursework for non-life science majors who aspire to become physicians. Students entering these programs generally do not have previous college-level exposure to the natural sciences. This pilot study was conducted to determine characteristics of scientifically naive, career changer, pre-medical students that may be used by PBPMP admissions committees. Statistical analyses were performed between Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores and student gender, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores, undergraduate field of study, and undergraduate Grade Point Average (GPA). While relationships between certain subscores on the SAT and MCAT were found, data suggest that other non-quantitative metrics be considered as predictors of performance among PBPMP students.",
