  "title": "Utility of the INTERMACS profile at the time of assessment for heart transplant.",
  "abstract": "The Interagency Registry of Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profiles are associated with mortality in heart failure patients undergoing ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation and heart transplantation (HTx). We assessed the prognostic value of the INTERMACS profile at the time of assessment for HTx or durable VAD implantation as bridge to candidacy (BTC). A total of 503 consecutive patients considered for HTx or VAD between 2006 and 2016 were included. The associations between INTERMACS profile and (a) waitlist mortality or delisting, (b) probability of HTx, and (c) overall mortality or delisting were evaluated using multivariable analysis. Median follow-up time was 2.9 years (IQR: 0.9-5.5) during which 184 received VAD, 347 received HTx, and 73 died (27 waitlist, 46 post-transplant). INTERMACS I-II profile was associated with higher waitlist mortality or delisting (HR: 3.83, 95% CI: 1.22-12.03), and this risk was reversed by VAD implantation (HR: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03-0.50). INTERMACS III-IV profile was associated with a higher probability of HTx (HR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.37-2.40). INTERMACS profile was not associated with the composite outcome of overall mortality or delisting. These results emphasize the prognostic utility of INTERMACS at time of decision for advanced therapies and its potential value in selecting patients for different interventions.",
