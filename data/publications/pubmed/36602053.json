  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Monkeypox virus (MPXV) disease has been declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization, creating an urgent need for neurologists to be able to recognize, diagnosis, and treat MPXV-associated neurologic disease. METHODS: Three cases of MPXV-associated central nervous system (CNS) disease occurring during the 2022 outbreak, and their associated imaging findings are presented, with 2 cases previously published in a limited capacity in a public health bulletin. RESULTS: Three previously healthy immunocompetent gay men in their 30s developed a febrile illness followed by progressive neurologic symptoms with presence of a vesiculopustular rash. MPXV nucleic acid was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from skin lesions of 2 patients, with the third patient having indeterminate testing but an epidemiologic link to a confirmed MPXV disease case. Cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and negative MPXV-specific PCR. In 2 patients, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine demonstrated partially enhancing, longitudinally extensive central spinal cord lesions with multifocal subcortical, basal ganglia, thalamic, cerebellar, and/or brainstem lesions. The third patient had thalamic and basal ganglia lesions. All patients received 14â€‰days of tecovirimat, and 2 patients also received multiple forms of immunotherapy, including intravenous immunoglobulin, pulsed high-dose steroids, plasmapheresis, and/or rituximab. Good neurologic recovery was observed in all cases. INTERPRETATION: MPXV can be associated with CNS disease. It is unclear whether this is from a parainfectious immune-mediated injury or direct CNS viral invasion. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:893-905.",
