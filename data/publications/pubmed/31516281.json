  "title": "Abernethy malformation: Our experience from a tertiary cardiac care center and review of literature.",
  "abstract": "Abernethy malformation, also called as congenital extrahepatic portosystemic venous shunt, is a rare anomaly involving the portal venous system. Although rare, it is increasingly being reported and is important to diagnose given the adverse clinical consequences in untreated patients. It has myriad of clinical presentations, from being completely asymptomatic to causing hepatic carcinoma, hepatic encephalopathy, severe pulmonary hypertension, and diffuse pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. We describe our experience with five cases in a tertiary pediatric cardiac care center with Abernethy malformation, with review of literature and also discuss possible therapeutic implications.",
