  "title": "ADJUNCTIVE VASOPRESSORS AND SHORT-TERM MORTALITY IN ADULTS WITH SEPTIC SHOCK: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS.",
  "abstract": "Background: Adjunctive vasopressors are added to norepinephrine in one-third of adults with septic shock in the United States. However, effectiveness of this approach is unclear, and treatment recommendations are based on indirect evidence. We sought to synthesize the direct evidence for adjunctive vasopressor administration in adults with septic shock. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to June 7, 2023. We included randomized clinical trials of adults with septic shock comparing adjunctive treatment with a vasopressin analogue, angiotensin II, methylene blue, hydroxocobalamin, or catecholamine analog to standard care vasopressors. The primary outcome was short-term mortality (at or before 28-30 days or intensive care discharge). Secondary outcomes included kidney replacement therapy, digital/peripheral ischemia, and venous thromboembolism. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to derive risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs. The certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. Results: Of 6,763 records, 17 trials (3,813 participants) were included. Compared with standard care, adjunctive vasopressor administration may reduce short-term mortality risk (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-1.00], low certainty, 17 trials [3618 participants]) and likely reduces kidney replacement therapy receipt (RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.01], moderate certainty, eight trials [2,408 participants]). Adjunctive vasopressor treatment may increase risk of digital/peripheral ischemia (RR, 2.44 [95% CI, 1.17-5.10], low certainty, nine trials [2,981 participants]) and venous thromboembolism (RR, 16.48 [95% CI, 0.96-283.17], low certainty, one trial [321 participants]). There was some evidence that the pooled estimate for short-term mortality was different (interaction P = 0.13) for trials adjudicated as low risk of bias (RR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.87-1.05]) compared with trials adjudicated as some concerns or high risk of bias (RR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.69-0.97]). The findings were robust to multiple sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Conclusions: In adults with septic shock, adjunctive vasopressors may lower short-term death risk and likely lower kidney replacement therapy risk, but may increase risk of adverse effects. In the United States, adjunctive vasopressor use prevalence in septic shock is disconnected from the low evidence certainty for a favorable mortality-to-risk profile.",
