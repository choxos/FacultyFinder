  "abstract": "The respiratory disease caused by the Coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID19) has spread rapidly since December 2019 in Wuhan, China. This new strain of Coronavirus is similar to the SARS Corona virus and has been termed SARS-CoV-2. Both viruses have emerged from bats and adapted to humans. On March 11, 2020 COVID19 was declared Pandemic by the WHO and as of May 1, 2020 COVID19 disease continues to grow rapidly with 3,400,595 cases and 239,583 deaths world-wide. This review describes the biology of SARSCOV2, Detection, Macrophage-Mediated Pathogenesis and Potential Treatments.",
