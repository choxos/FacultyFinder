  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Although hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is associated with several cardiovascular risk mediators, information on the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in this population is sparse. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of MI, CVA, and composite disease (MI or CVA) in patients with HS, stratified by use of biologic agents, with controls without HS. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted between January 1, 1999, and April 1, 2019, using a demographically heterogeneous population-based sample of over 56 million unique patients. Individuals with HS (n = 49 862) and without HS (n = 1 421 223) were identified using electronic health records data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was incidence of composite MI or CVA. RESULTS: Of the 49 862 patients with HS, 37 981 were women (76.2%), 29 711 were white (59.6%), and mean (SD) age was 38.3 (13.3) years. Crude incidence rate of composite disease was 6.6 (95% CI, 6.3-7.0) per 1000 person-years in patients with HS compared with 6.8 (95% CI, 6.7-6.8) per 1000 person-years in controls. In patients with HS, crude incidence rates were 2.9 (95% CI, 2.6-3.1) per 1000 person-years for MI alone and 4.1 (95% CI, 3.9-4.4) per 1000 person-years for CVA alone compared with 3.2 (95% CI, 3.18-3.25) per 1000 person-years for MI alone in control patients and 4.1 (95% CI, 4.0-4.1) per 1000 person-years for CVA alone in control patients. In adjusted analysis, patients with HS had a 23% increased risk of composite disease (hazard ratio [HR], 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17-1.30; P < .001) and a similar increase in the risk of MI alone (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.12-1.32; P < .001) and CVA alone (HR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.14-1.31; P < .001) compared with control patients. The relative difference in composite MI or CVA risk between patients with HS and controls was highest among younger patients HR in subgroup aged 18-29 years: 1.67; 95% CI, 1.37-2.03). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Patients with HS appear to have an increased risk of MI and CVA. Early management of modifiable cardiovascular risk mediators may be warranted in patients with HS.",
