  "title": "The Impact of Parental Suicide Stigma on Youth Suicide Stigma in Mexico.",
  "abstract": "Suicide negatively impacts societies worldwide. A particular area of concern is the prevalence of suicide among Latinx youth, as research indicates that suicide behaviors among Latinx in the United States and youth in Latin America have increased drastically over the last decade. Reducing suicide stigma is a key factor in promoting youth help-seeking behaviors regarding suicidality. Previous research suggests that a relationship with a trusted adult may influence the likelihood of an adolescent contacting a suicide crisis line. Our study seeks to further the research of how parents can influence youth perceptions of suicide by studying the relationship between parent and child suicide stigma. Data were collected from parent-child dyads throughout Mexico. The Stigma of Suicide Scale Short Form was used to measure suicide stigma among adult and youth participants independently. Results suggest that parent suicide stigma was a significant predictor of youth suicide stigma, that male youth in our sample had higher suicide stigma than female youth, and that access to healthcare services was associated with lower suicide stigma. Results are discussed considering unique cultural factors in Mexico such as familismo. If future research reinforces the findings of this study, suicide stigma programs might be more effective if targeted at the entire family unit rather than just adolescents.",
