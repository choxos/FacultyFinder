  "title": "The Intersection of Socioeconomic Differences and Sex in the Management and Outcomes of Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Nationwide Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "Patients with lower socioeconomic status (SES) have poorer outcomes following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) than patients with higher SES; however, how sex modifies socioeconomic differences is unclear. Using the United Kingdom (UK) Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) registry, alongside Office of National Statistics (ONS) mortality data, we analyzed 736,420 AMI patients between 2005 and 2018, stratified by Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) score Quintiles (most affluent [Q1] to most deprived [Q5]). There was no significant difference in probability of in-hospital mortality in our adjusted model according to sex. The probability of 30-day mortality in our adjusted model was similar between men and women throughout Quintiles, ((Q5; Men 7.6%; 95% CI 7.3-7.8% (P < .001), Women; 7.0%; 95% CI 6.8-7.3%, P < .001)) ((Q1; Men 7.1%; 95% CI 6.8-7.4%, P < .001, Women; 6.9%; 95% CI 6.6-7.1%, P < .001)). The probability of one-year mortality in our adjusted model was higher in men throughout all Quintiles (Q1; Men 15.0%; 95% CI 14.8-15.6%), P < .001, Women; 14.5%; 95% CI 14.2-14.9%, P < .001) (Q5; Men 16.9%; 95% CI 16.5-17.3%, P < .001, Women; 15.5%; 95% CI 15.1-15.9 by %, P < .001). Overall, female sex did not significantly influence the effect of deprivation on AMI processes of care and outcomes.",
