  "title": "A Prognostic Survival Model Incorporating Patient-Reported Outcomes for Transplant-Ineligible Patients With Multiple Myeloma.",
  "abstract": "Developing prognostic tools specifically for patients themselves represents an important step in empowering patients to engage in shared decision-making. Incorporating patient-reported outcomes may improve the accuracy of these prognostic tools. We conducted a retrospective population-based study of transplant-ineligible (TIE) patients with multiple myeloma (MM) diagnosed between January 2007 and December 2018. A multivariable Cox regression model was developed to predict the risk of death within 1-year period from the index date. We identified 2356 patients with TIE MM. The following factors were associated with an increased risk of death within 1 year: age > 80 (HR 1.11), history of heart failure (HR 1.52), \"CRAB\" at diagnosis (HR 1.61), distance to cancer center (HR 1.25), prior radiation (HR 1.48), no proteosome inhibitor/immunomodulatory therapy usage (HR 1.36), recent emergency department (HR 1.55) or hospitalization (HR 2.13), poor performance status (ECOG 3-4 HR 1.76), and increasing number of severe symptoms (HR 1.56). Model discrimination was high with C-statistic of 0.74, and calibration was very good. To our knowledge, this represents one of the first prognostic models developed in MM incorporating patient-reported outcomes. This survival prognostic tool may improve communication regarding prognosis and shared decision-making among older adults with MM and their health care providers.",
