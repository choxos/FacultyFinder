  "title": "Mothers on Mute: A Silent Pandemic.",
  "abstract": "My experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, and trying to write through it, has been profoundly shaped by my identity as a mother. Like me, many women-mothers in particular-have had their voices muted by the demands of domestic labor. Trying to find a way to continue telling the stories that matter to me during these times has made me see how important it is for mothers to unmute and claim a space for our voices, even if our voices must change in order to be heard.",
