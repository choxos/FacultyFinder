  "abstract": "CCR5 is among the most studied chemokine receptors due to its profound significance in human health and disease. The notion that CCR5 is a functionally redundant receptor was challenged through the demonstration of its unique protective role in the context of West Nile virus in both mice and humans. In the nearly two decades since this initial discovery, numerous studies have investigated the role of CCR5 in the context of other medically important neurotropic flaviviruses, most of which appear to support a broad neuroprotective role for this receptor, although how CCR5 exerts its protective effect has been remarkably varied. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms by which CCR5 controls neurotropic flaviviruses, as well as results from human studies evaluating a genetic link to CCR5, and propose unexplored areas of research that are needed to unveil even more exciting roles for this important receptor.",
