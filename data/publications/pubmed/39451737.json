  "title": "Simplifying Serious Illness Communication: Preparing or Deciding.",
  "abstract": "Clinicians have a sincere desire to ensure that the decision-making processes of seriously ill patients are well informed throughout illness trajectories. A quagmire of variable terminology (e.g., advance care planning, serious illness conversations, goals-of-care discussions, etc.), however, currently predominates the field of serious illness communication. This creates uncertainty among clinicians as to the overall purpose, tasks, and specific outcomes of conversations that address serious illness. The Preparing or Deciding model is a unifying framework that provides conceptual clarity by helping clinicians understand their role in leading these important conversations. The Preparing or Deciding model simply posits that conversations with seriously ill patients are about either preparing or deciding. It considers these tasks to be mutually exclusive, which can help bypass many of the barriers to having these conversations. The Preparing or Deciding model compliments all existing resources and frameworks and is applicable to all healthcare practitioners in every care setting. To help move forward serious illness communication education and research, as well as process improvement efforts more effectively, here, we describe the Preparing or Deciding model.",
