  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The insecticide treated bed net (ITN) has been proven for malaria control. Evidence from systematic review also suggests benefits of ITN roll out in reducing the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and other vector borne diseases. METHODS: Using a community-based cross-sectional study design, ITN use, factors associated with non-use of ITNs, and occurrence of sand flies were investigated in three communities with reported cases of CL in the Oti region of Ghana. RESULTS: A total of 587 households comprising 189 (32.2%), 200 (34.1%), and 198 (33.7%) households from Ashiabre, Keri, and Sibi Hilltop communities with de facto population of 3639 participated in this study. The proportion of households that owned at least one ITN was 97.1%. The number of households having at least one ITN for every two members was 386 (65.8%) and 3159 (86.8%) household population had access to ITN. The household population that slept in ITN the night before this survey was 2370 (65.1%). Lack of household access to ITN (AOR = 1.80; CI: 1.31, 2.47), having a family size of more than 10 members (AOR = 2.53; CI: 1.20, 4.24), having more than 10 rooms for sleeping in a household (AOR = 10.18; CI: 1.28, 81.00), having 2-4 screened windows (AOR = 1.49; CI: 1.00, 2.20), and having 8-10 screened windows (AOR = 3.57; CI: 1.25, 10.17) were significantly associated with increased odds of not sleeping in ITN the night before the survey. A total of 193 female sand flies were trapped from various locations within the study communities. CONCLUSIONS: Factors associated with ITN non-use such as lack of household access to ITN should be incorporated into future efforts to improve ITN use. Species of sand flies and their potential vectorial role in the study communities should also be investigated.",
