  "title": "Improved Self-Cleaning Properties of Photocatalytic Gypsum Plaster Enriched with Glass Fiber.",
  "abstract": "In the study the self-cleaning properties of photoactive gypsum plasters are presented. The modified gypsum plasters were obtained by addition of 1 and 3 wt.% of nitrogen-modified titanium dioxide (TiO2/N) and 0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 wt.% of glass fiber. The self-cleaning ability of the obtained materials was tested during two dyes decomposition: Methylene Blue (MB) and Reactive Orange (RO). It was found that presence of glass fiber increased photocatalytic activity of modified gypsum plasters, which may be due to the fact glass fiber may act as ducts for light and transport it to sites screened by TiO2 or glass fiber can retard charge recombination. Moreover, unexpectedly the addition of glass fiber did not increase the mechanical properties of modified gypsum plasters, which may be because gypsum does not strongly adhere to the surface of glass fibers.",
