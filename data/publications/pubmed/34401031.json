  "title": "A case report of congenital temporal bone encephalocele presenting as a tumor in a child.",
  "abstract": "An encephalocele may be congenital or acquired and is characterized by the herniation of cranial contents through a skull bone defect. Most congenital encephaloceles occur in the occipital area, and temporal bone encephaloceles in children are rare. Congenital encephaloceles can be diagnosed either prenatally or after birth. We describe the case of a congenital temporal bone encephalocele in a 2-month-old boy that was diagnosed after birth. The patient presented with seizures and a bulging mass in the right neck that was detected by his mother during the second month after birth. The combined results from brain magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of encephalocele. Although the surgical repair was offered, the family declined.",
