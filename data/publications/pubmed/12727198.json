  "title": "Method to overcome photoreaction, a serious drawback to the use of dichlorofluorescin in evaluation of reactive oxygen species.",
  "abstract": "Non-fluorescent dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) was converted to fluorescent products by photo-irradiation during observations with spectrofluorometer and fluorescence microscopy. Photo-irradiation of DCFH at 250, 300, 330, 400, 500, or 600 nm generated fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF), an oxidation product of DCFH, and an unrecognized fluorescent product. The ratio of the unknown product to DCF varied from 0.15 to 8.21 depending on wavelength. Although reactive oxygen species scavengers, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and sodium azide, did not suppress the increase in non-specified fluorescence, reagents such as ascorbic acid, mercaptopropionyl glycine, and methoxycinnamic acid, in a cell-free system, almost completely suppressed it with little effect on the fluorescence of DCF. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid also suppressed non-specified fluorescence in cells, but not completely. At low concentrations of DCFH, the speed of increasing fluorescence was considerably retarded, to such a degree that the fluorescence increase in cells during fluorescence microscopic observation was negligible. The addition, at the time of evaluation, of the above reagents to cell-free systems and, in cell systems, reducing the concentration of DCFH, effectively suppressed the photoreaction of DCFH.",
