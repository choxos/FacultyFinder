  "abstract": "Asthma is the leading chronic illness in children, affecting about 4.8 million children in the United States. Recent reports indicate a lack of asthma educational resources for rural school health nurses to use in their practice. This article describes the development of the My Asthma Coloring Book educational tool for children and their families living in rural communities. My Asthma Coloring Book was developed to provide asthma information in a short-story format for children with asthma. The coloring book content is described, including its utilization as part of the A+ Asthma Rural Partnership research project funded by the National Institute of Nursing Research (R01NR05062-01).",
