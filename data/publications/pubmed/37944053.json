  "title": "A phase II clinical trial of frameless, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases.",
  "abstract": "Stereotactic radiation therapy yields high rates of local control for brain metastases, but patients in rural or suburban areas face geographic and socioeconomic barriers to its access. We conducted a phase II clinical trial of frameless, fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases in an integrated academic satellite network for patients 18 years of age or older with 4 or fewer brain metastases. Dose was based on gross tumor volume: less than 3.0 cm, 27 Gy in 3 fractions and 3.0 to 3.9 cm, 30 Gy in 5 fractions. Median follow-up was 10 months for 73 evaluable patients, with a median age of 68 years. Median intracranial progression-free survival was 7.1 months (95% confidence interval = 5.3 to not reached), and median survival was 7.2 months (95% confidence interval = 5.4 to not reached); there were no serious adverse events. Outcomes of this trial compare favorably with contemporary trials, and this treatment strategy provides opportunities to expand stereotactic radiation therapy access to underserved populations.",
