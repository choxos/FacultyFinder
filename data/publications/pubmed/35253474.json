  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine potential determinants of participation frequency and limitations in people with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). METHODS: For this secondary analysis, we grouped the following factors using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) components: age, psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), gait aid use, supplemental oxygen use, grip strength, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea scale, Short Physical Performance Battery, and Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWT). Participation was measured using the frequency and limitation domains of the Late Life Disability Instrument (LLDI). Relationships between factors and participation were examined using linear regression. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants (age 68.7 ± 8.1 yrs; FEV1 %pred 34 IQR 25-54) were included in the analysis. Factors were linked to four ICF components: activity, body functions, personal, and environmental factors. The final model for LLDI-frequency contained HADS, use of gait aid, and 6MWT (F (3, 81) = 27.69 (p < .001), R[2] = 0.51), and for LLDI-limitations, the final model included age, HADS, and 6MWT (F (3, 82) = 19.74 (p < .001), R[2] = 0.42). DISCUSSION: Participation in life situations in people with COPD is associated with multiple ICF components. Psychological distress (i.e., anxiety and depression symptoms) and mobility were important determinants of participation frequency and limitations. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these relationships.",
