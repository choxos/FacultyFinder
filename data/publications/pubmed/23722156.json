  "abstract": "This study examines the profile of injuries among adolescents in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and identifies related factors associated with injury. A cross-sectional study design determined incidence of injury for a sample of 6363 adolescents. Data collected information on injury in the past 12 months, socio-demographic, behavioural and sensory data. Logistic regression modelling was used to examine predictors of physical injury for the past 12 months. Among participants, 18% experienced injury; the three top causes include accidental falls (38%), being struck by an object or person (18%), and motor vehicle injuries (MVI) (13%). The majority of injuries took place at the participant's home and surrounding area. Identified risk factors that are amenable for prevention include smoking behaviour, exposure to smoking, physical activity profile, family income, and speeding behaviour. Our findings highlight the need for public health policies and education programmes that reduce injury among the UAE adolescent population.",
