  "title": "Effectiveness of Low-Frequency Pallidal Deep Brain Stimulation at 65 Hz in Tourette Syndrome.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) for refractory Tourette syndrome (TS) is often applied using a high frequency. The effectiveness of low-frequency long-term stimulation is unknown. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of low-frequency DBS applied to the globus pallidus pars internus (GPi) at 65 Hz for the treatment of TS, with long-term follow-up, to provide data for the optimization of stimulation parameters. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of six patients with refractory TS were implanted with electrodes in the GPi and were assigned to receive low-frequency (65 Hz) DBS programming. Assessments were performed pre-DBS and at 3, 12, and a median of 34 (range 26-48) months post-DBS. The primary outcome was tic severity, as assessed by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), and the secondary outcomes were comorbid behavioral disorders, mood, functioning, and quality of life. RESULTS: We noted significant differences in the YGTSS scores between the baseline and the post-DBS follow-ups (pÂ = 0.01). At the final follow-up, four of six (66.6%) patients had a greater than 50% reduction in the YGTSS score, whereas the remaining two patients showed a mild worsening of tic severity. The secondary outcome measures also showed remarkable improvements in associated behavioral disorders, mood, functioning, and quality of life. Stimulation-induced adverse effects were not reported, although a device-related complication (an uncomfortable feeling in the neck) occurred in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that low-frequency DBS represents an effective and practical treatment for refractory TS with comparable efficacy to high-frequency DBS.",
