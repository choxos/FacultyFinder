  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To examine the willingness of older patients to take less diabetes medication (de-intensify) and to identify characteristics associated with willingness to de-intensify treatment. METHODS: Survey conducted in 2019 in an age-stratified, random sample of older (65-100 years) adults with diabetes on glucose-lowering medications in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry. We classified survey responses to the question: \"I would be willing to take less medication for my diabetes\" as willing, neutral, or unwilling to de-intensify. Willingness to de-intensify treatment was examined by several clinical characteristics, including American Diabetes Association (ADA) health status categories used for individualizing glycemic targets. Analyses were weighted to account for over-sampling of older individuals. RESULTS: A total of 1337 older adults on glucose-lowering medication(s) were included (age 74.2 ± 6.0 years, 44% female, 54.4% non-Hispanic white). The proportions of participants willing, neutral, or unwilling to take less medication were 51.2%, 27.3%, and 21.5%, respectively. Proportions of willing to take less medication varied by age (65-74 years: 54.2% vs. 85+ years: 38.5%) and duration of diabetes (0-4 years: 61.0% vs. 15+ years: 44.2%), both p < 0.001. Patients on 1-2 medications were more willing to take less medication(s) compared with patients on 10+ medications (62.1% vs. 46.6%, p = 0.03). Similar proportions of willingness to take less medications were seen across ADA health status, and HbA1c. Willingness to take less medication(s) was similar across survey responses to questions about patient-clinician relationships. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical guidelines suggest considering treatment de-intensification in older patients with longer duration of diabetes, yet patients with these characteristics are less likely to be willing to take less medication(s).",
