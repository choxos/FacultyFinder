  "title": "Supporting the Use of Health Technology Assessments by Decision-Makers.",
  "abstract": "A perceived gap exists in how well Canadian health technology assessment (HTA) producers are supporting the use of their HTAs by decision-makers. The authors propose that the newly released HTA Database Canadian search interface incorporate structured decision-relevant summaries of HTAs that would be developed by participating Canadian HTA organizations. The registry would serve as a \"one-stop shop\" by including HTA reports along with their structured summaries in a format that better meets decision-makers' needs. The Health Technology Analysis Exchange - a Canadian network of publicly funded HTA producers - is well-positioned to undertake this work and would welcome input about both the idea and its execution.",
