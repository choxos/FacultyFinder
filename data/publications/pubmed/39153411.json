  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of disability, and disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs (DMOADs) could represent a pivotal advancement in treatment. Identifying the potential of antidiabetic medications as DMOADs could impact patient care significantly. METHODS: We designed a comprehensive analysis pipeline involving two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR) (genetic proxies for antidiabetic drug targets), summary-based MR (SMR) (for mRNA), and colocalisation (for drug-target genes) to assess their causal relationship with 12 osteoarthritis phenotypes. Summary statistics from the largest genome-wide association meta-analysis (GWAS) of osteoarthritis and gene expression data from the eQTLGen consortium were utilised. FINDINGS: Seven out of eight major types of clinical antidiabetic medications were identified, resulting in fourteen potential drug targets. Sulfonylurea targets ABCC8/KCNJ11 were associated with increased osteoarthritis risk at any site (odds ratio (OR): 2.07, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.50-2.84, P < 3 × 10[-4]), while PPARG, influenced by thiazolidinediones (TZDs), was associated with decreased risk of hand (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48-0.76, P < 3 × 10[-4]), finger (OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.35-0.73, P < 3 × 10[-4]), and thumb (OR: 0.49, 95% CI: 0.34-0.71, P < 3 × 10[-4]) osteoarthritis. Metformin and GLP1-RA, targeting GPD1 and GLP1R respectively, were associated with reduced risk of knee and finger osteoarthritis. In the SMR analyses, gene expression of KCNJ11, GANAB, ABCA1, and GSTP1, targeted by antidiabetic drugs, was significantly linked to at least one osteoarthritis phenotype and was replicated across at least two gene expression datasets. Additionally, increased KCNJ11 expression was related to decreased osteoarthritis risk and co-localised with at least one osteoarthritis phenotype. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a potential therapeutic role for antidiabetic drugs in treating osteoarthritis. The results indicate that certain antidiabetic drug targets may modify disease progression, with implications for developing targeted DMOADs.
