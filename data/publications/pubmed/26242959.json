  "title": "What Will It Take to Address the Global Threat of Antibiotic Resistance?",
  "abstract": "In March 2015, the Dag Hammarskj√∂ld Foundation convened a workshop in Uppsala, Sweden to address questions about antibiotic resistance, in partnership with the Global Strategy Lab, the Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics (JLME), the Norwegian Institute of Public Health, and ReAct - Action on Antibiotic Resistance. Eleven concise articles were commissioned to explore whether ABR depended on global collective action, and if so, what tools could help states and non-state actors to achieve it. This article introduces that collection, which is found in an online-only symposium at aslme.org.",
