  "title": "Prevalence and incidence of Paget's disease of bone: Temporal trend over 20 years in the province of Quebec, Canada.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Paget's disease of bone (PDB) is a focal bone disorder characterized by an increased bone remodeling and an anarchic bone structure. A decline of prevalence and incidence of PDB has been observed in some countries. No epidemiological data are available on PDB in Canada. AIMS: We aimed at examining the evolution of the prevalence and incidence of PDB in Quebec (Canada) by analyzing health administrative databases. METHODS: PDB case definition relied on one or more hospitalizations, or one or more physician-billing claims with a diagnosis code of PDB. To identify incident cases, a 'run-in' period of four years (1996-1999) was used to exclude prevalent cases. For each fiscal year from 2000 to 2001 to 2019-2020 (population size 2,914,480), crude age and sex-specific prevalence and incidence rates of PDB among individuals aged ≥55 years were determined, and sex-specific rates were also standardized to the 2011 age structure of the Quebec population. Generalized linear regressions were used to test for linear changes in standardized prevalence and incidence rates. RESULTS: Over the study period, standardized prevalence of PDB has remained stable in Quebec, from 0.44 % in 2000/2001 to 0.43 % in 2019/2020 (mean change -0.002, p-value = 0.0935). For the 2019-2020 fiscal year, 13,165 men and women had been diagnosed with PDB and prevalence of PDB increased with age. Standardized incidence of PDB has decreased over time from 0.77/1000 in 2000/2001 to 0.28/1000 in 2019-2020 (mean change -0.228/year, p-value<0.0001), the incidence decreasing from 0.82/1000 to 0.37/1000 in men and from 0.76/1000 to 0.22/1000 in women, respectively. This decrease was observed in all age categories. CONCLUSION: With the exception of a slight increase in PDB prevalence up to 0.55 % in years 2005 to 2007, the prevalence of PDB has remained stable in Quebec over the past 20 years, 13,160 men and women being currently diagnosed with PDB. The incidence has decreased over time. Our results support the epidemiological changes of PDB reported in other countries.",
