  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lichen planus (LP) is a chronic mucocutaneous inflammatory disease with significant morbidity but data on epidemiology and therapeutics for LP is limited. OBJECTIVE: To describe overall prevalence of LP and dermatologist-prescribed LP treatments in US adults. METHODS: Using the Explorys database, we analyzed prevalence of overall LP and dermatologists' utilization of medications of interest. RESULTS: Among 566,851 eligible patients in the prevalence analysis, there were 1098 LP cases with a median age of 66 years. Overall crude prevalence of LP was 0.19% (95% CI 0.18-0.21) with higher prevalence in females (prevalence ratio vs males 1.77, 95% CI 1.53-2.05). Standardized overall prevalence was 0.15%. Most LP patients diagnosed by dermatologists remained untreated after 1 year (n = 1061, 53%); the most common initial treatment was topical corticosteroids (38%). Treatment continuation after 1 year and switching were most common after initial use of systemic immunosuppressants (28% and 46%, respectively). LIMITATIONS: The lack of a precise diagnosis code for nonoral LP allows for the potential of misclassification; disease severity cannot be established. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Standardized prevalence of overall LP was 0.15%. For patients requiring systemic immunosuppressive medications, treatment continuation and switching were more common, suggesting that further research into medication selection for LP may be clinically beneficial.",
