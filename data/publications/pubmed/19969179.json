  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Giangregorio LM, Thabane L, deBeer J, Farrauto L, McCartney N, Adachi JD, Papaioannou A. Body weight-supported treadmill training for patients with hip fracture: a feasibility study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the feasibility of body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT) as a strategy for improving independent ambulation among patients who had sustained a hip fracture. DESIGN: Nonrandomized controlled trial. SETTING: Inpatient rehabilitation. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with a stable hip fracture and at least 50% weight-bearing. INTERVENTION: BWSTT in lieu of standard walking exercises throughout stay in rehabilitation. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Feasibility outcomes included the number of patients agreeing to participate in treadmill walking, the number who returned for follow-up assessments, compliance, and the number of adverse events. Secondary outcomes included the Lower Extremity Functional Scale, the Timed Up & Go test, a 2-minute walk test, and the Falls Self-Efficacy Scale. Univariate regression was used to assess the group effect on score changes from baseline to discharge and from baseline to follow-up. RESULTS: Among 41 potentially eligible patients, 21 (51%) agreed to participate and 14 returned for follow-up assessments. The recruitment goal of 12 patients agreeing to BWSTT was achieved; however, retention by 3-month follow-up was 67%. The average compliance was 3 sessions a week; however, several patients were below average. No adverse events of BWSTT were reported. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: BWSTT may be a feasible method for retraining gait among patients with hip fracture. However, future studies evaluating its efficacy need rigorous methods for ensuring compliance and retention.",
