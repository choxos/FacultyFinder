  "title": "Total Abdominal Colectomy Versus Diverting Loop Ileostomy and Antegrade Colonic Lavage for Fulminant Clostridioides Colitis: Analysis of the National Inpatient Sample 2016-2019.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When surgery is indicated for fulminant Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), total abdominal colectomy (TAC) is the most common approach. Diverting loop ileostomy (DLI) with antegrade colonic lavage has been introduced as a colon-sparing surgical approach. Prior analyses of National Inpatient Sample (NIS) data suggested equivalent postoperative outcomes between groups but did not evaluate healthcare resource utilization. As such, we aimed to analyze a more recent NIS cohort to compare these two approaches in terms of both postoperative outcomes and healthcare resource utilization. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the NIS from 2016 to 2019 was conducted. The primary outcome was postoperative in-hospital morbidity. Secondary outcomes included postoperative in-hospital mortality, system-specific postoperative complications, total admission cost, and length of stay (LOS). Univariable and multivariable regressions were utilized to compare the two operative approaches. RESULTS: In total, 886 patients underwent TAC and 409 patients underwent DLI with antegrade colonic lavage. Adjusted analyses demonstrated no difference between groups in postoperative in-hospital morbidity (aOR 0.96, 95%CI 0.64-1.44, p = 0.851) or in-hospital mortality (aOR 1.15, 95%CI 0.81-1.64, p = 0.436). Patients undergoing TAC experienced significantly decreased total admission cost (MD $79,715.34, 95%CI 133,841-25,588, p = 0.004) and shorter postoperative LOS (MD 4.06 days, 95%CI 6.96-1.15, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: There are minimal differences between TAC and DLI with antegrade colonic lavage for fulminant CDI in terms of postoperative morbidity and mortality. Healthcare resource utilization, however, is significantly improved when patients undergo TAC as evidenced by clinically important decreases in total admission cost and postoperative LOS.",
