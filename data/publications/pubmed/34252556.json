  "title": "Osteochondroplasty Benefits the Pragmatic Patient With Femoroacetabular Impingement: Analysis From the Embedded Prospective Cohort of the Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed Controlled Trial (FIRST).",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine whether arthroscopic osteochondroplasty demonstrated effectiveness in a pragmatic femoroacetabular impingement patient population embedded within FIRST (the Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed controlled Trial). METHODS: All cohort patients were not randomized and were followed prospectively with a follow-up assessment protocol identical to that in FIRST. The primary outcome was hip pain using a 100-point visual analog scale. Secondary outcomes included hip function (Hip Outcome Score, International Hip Outcome Tool-12), health utility (EuroQol 5 Dimensions), and health-related quality of life (Short Form-12) at 12 months, as well as operatively and nonoperatively treated hip complications at 24 months. We performed multivariable regressions to compare these outcomes between 3 groups of patients: (1) those randomized to lavage in FIRST, (2) those randomized to osteochondroplasty in FIRST, and (3) those who received osteochondroplasty as part of the cohort study. RESULTS: All groups had improvements across all questionnaire outcomes from baseline to 12 months, with no significant differences. There were significantly more reoperations in the lavage trial group compared with those in the embedded cohort (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-7.73; P = .016). There were significantly more nonoperatively treated hip complications in the lavage trial group and in the osteochondroplasty trial group when compared with those in the embedded cohort (aOR 3.81; 95% CI 1.19-12.17; P = .024 and aOR 4.55; 95% CI 1.43-14.42; P = .010, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hip arthroscopic osteochondroplasty and lavage led to improvement in hip pain, function, and health-related quality of life at 12 months across both randomized controlled trial (RCT) and cohort patients. The pragmatic cohort receiving osteochondroplasty had (1) significantly fewer complications than RCT patients, (2) significantly less reoperations than RCT patients randomized to arthroscopic lavage, and (3) fewer, although nonsignificant, reoperations than RCT osteochondroplasty patients. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II, therapeutic.",
