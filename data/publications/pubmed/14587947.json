  "abstract": "The ability of a photosensitizer-containing cellulose acetate film to kill bacteria was evaluated. Substantial kills were achieved following irradiation of the film with white light for up to 24 hours. Applying a photosensitizer-containing coating to surfaces could reduce the environmental load of pathogens, thus helping to prevent infectious disease transmission.",
