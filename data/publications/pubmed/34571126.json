  "abstract": "Compressed tablet formation from granular drug require binder with Cohesiveness property. Plants mucilage as pharmaceutical excipients are available. In this study, biocompatible date palm mucilage was encapsulated with silver nano particles for sustained drug release to provoke an immune response. Nano formulated mucilage was characterized by UV/VIS, FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDX spectrophotometry. UV/VIS spectra revealed an intense surface plasmon resonance peak at 406 nm for spherical mono dispersed silver nano formulated mucilage resulted from efficient reduction of silver ions to AgNPs. Zeta sizer disclosed the emergence of single peak at 139.7 nm with 100% intensity. Crude mucilage exhibited number of peaks in the region of 4000-500 cm[-1] by FT-IR spectroscopy whereas purified as well as nano formulated samples showed somewhat different pattern of peaks in addition to peaks of crude sample. XRD spectra of crude mucilage revealed somewhat regular pattern while purified and modified mucilage displayed irregular structure. In SEM analysis, crude mucilage was appeared as granular that turned into porous network with entangled tiny silver nano spheres. A controlled release of drug levofloxacin hemihydrate was evaluated using crude/ nano formulated mucilage as excipient. Nano formulated mucilage delayed the onset exposure of drug in gastric medium giving recommendations as value added bio binder for drug to the target organ.",
