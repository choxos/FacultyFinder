  "title": "Short-Term Efficacy and Safety of Secukinumab for Ankylosing Spondylitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of RCTs.",
  "abstract": "Secukinumab is a novel IL-17A inhibitor that has been confirmed to be effective for treating PsA and RA. Several studies have demonstrated that secukinumab also provides benefits for AS patients. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the short-term efficacy and safety of secukinumab for the management of AS. The PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for RCTs published prior to March 2020 on the treatment of AS with secukinumab. The primary outcome was the ASAS20 response, and the secondary outcomes included the ASAS40 response, ASAS5/6 response, SF-36 PCS score, ASQoL score, and AEs. Dichotomous data were expressed as pooled RRs with 95% CIs, while continuous data were expressed as pooled MDs with 95% CIs. Subgroup analysis was conducted based on whether the AS patients previously underwent treatment with TNFi. A total of 4 RCTs with 1166 patients were included in our meta-analysis. At week 16, secukinumab 150 mg yielded significant improvements in the clinical response and patient-reported outcomes for AS patients. There was no increased risk of AEs. Consistent results were detected in the meta-analysis of secukinumab 75 mg versus a placebo. Furthermore, no significant difference was detected between the secukinumab 75 mg group and secukinumab 150 mg group. We concluded that secukinumab is effective for treating AS and generally well tolerated by AS patients in the short term, regardless of whether they previously underwent TNFi treatment. The superiority of secukinumab 150 mg over secukinumab 75 mg seems to be limited, since no significant difference in any endpoint was detected between the two groups.",
