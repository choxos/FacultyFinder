  "title": "Comparing Surgical Approaches for Craniopharyngioma Resection Among Adults and Children: A Meta-analysis and Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Craniopharyngioma treatment often necessitates surgical resection. Conventional approaches, such as transcranial and transsphenoidal approaches, are predominantly used. However, a recently adopted supraorbital approach may be more efficacious. Thus, this meta-analysis and systematic review aimed to compare the efficacy of the transcranial, transsphenoidal, and supraorbital approaches for resection and treatment of craniopharyngiomas. METHODS: This study was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Analyses were performed according to study design: (1) analyses for studies comparing several surgical approaches; and (2) analyses of all included studies. Random effects meta-analysis models were used to pool odds ratios among studies comparing several approaches. Similarly, categorical meta-regression models were used to examine the effect of surgical approach as a covariate of outcome data for all studies. Statistics were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (CMA 3.3, Biostat, Englewood, NJ) (significance set at P < 0.05). RESULTS: Patients were well-matched for age, sex, and preoperative comorbidities between groups stratified by surgical approach. Analyses including 22 studies that compared several approaches demonstrated that the transsphenoidal group had a greater occurrence of postoperative visual improvement (P < 0.0001), lesser occurrence of visual deterioration (P < 0.0001), and lower tumor recurrence rate (PÂ = 0.015) compared with the transcranial group. Only 2 studies compared the supraorbital approach to another approach, limiting analyses. Analyses including all studies demonstrated that the supraorbital group did not differ to either the transcranial or transsphenoidal group for any examined variables. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that the transsphenoidal approach is associated with improved clinical outcomes for craniopharyngioma resection. There are limited data regarding the supraorbital approach, warranting future investigation.",
