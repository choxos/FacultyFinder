  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report a case of ocular Mpox that responded favorably to treatment with topical interferon and oral doxycycline. METHODS: This is a case report of a previously healthy 24-year-old woman who developed a pustular rash, headache, fever, arthralgia, sore throat, and asthenia 3 weeks before attending to our clinic. Her main complaint at the moment of the visit was pain, photophobia, foreign body sensation, blurred vision, red eye, and discharge on the left eye. The slit-lamp examination of the left eye showed severe conjunctival hyperemia associated with tarsal follicles, 360 degrees ciliary injection, diffuse corneal epithelial edema with white linear epithelial infiltrates, pigmented and nonpigmented keratic precipitates, and two 1-mm peripheral corneal ulcers with white infiltrates, associated with positive fluorescein staining. Anterior chamber cellularity and flare were mildly present. RESULTS: Mpox with ocular manifestations diagnosis was confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) testing; samples were taken from corneal, conjunctival, and nasopharynx swab as well as a skin scab. Topical interferon alpha 2b 1 MIU/mL every 6 hours for 1 month and oral doxycycline 100 mg BID were administered along with other medications with consequent decrease of inflammation and malaise symptoms 1 week later, associated with uncorrected visual acuity improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Alternative and efficacious treatment options for Mpox ocular manifestations are needed to prevent further disease progression and sequelae in countries with no access to the gold-standard therapy. Topical interferon alpha 2b and oral doxycycline have shown adequate response as shown with this patient.",
