  "title": "Prevalence, clinical determinants and prognostic implications of coronary procedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention in non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: Insights from the contemporary multinational TAO trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few data are available on procedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the setting of acute coronary syndrome in the contemporary era. AIM: We sought to describe the prevalence of procedural complications of PCI in a non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE ACS) cohort, and to identify their clinical characteristics and association with clinical outcomes. METHODS: Patients randomized in TAO (Treatment of Acute coronary syndrome with Otamixaban), an international randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01076764) that compared otamixaban with unfractionated heparin plus eptifibatide in patients with NSTE ACS who underwent PCI, were included in the analysis. Procedural complications were collected prospectively, categorized and adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Events Committee, with review of angiograms. A multivariable model was constructed to identify independent clinical characteristics associated with procedural complications. RESULTS: A total of 8656 patients with NSTE ACS who were enrolled in the TAO trial underwent PCI, and 451 (5.2%) experienced at least one complication. The most frequent complications were no/slow reflow (1.5%) and dissection with decreased flow (1.2%). Procedural complications were associated with the 7-day ischaemic outcome of death, myocardial infarction or stroke (24.2% vs. 6.0%, odds ratio 5.01, 95% confidence interval 3.96-6.33; P<0.0001) and with Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction major and minor bleeding (6.2% vs. 2.3%, odds ratio 2.79, 95% confidence interval 1.86-4.2; P<0.0001). Except for previous coronary artery bypass grafting, multivariable analysis did not identify preprocedural clinical predictors of complications. CONCLUSIONS: In a contemporary NSTE ACS population, procedural complications with PCI remain frequent, are difficult to predict based on clinical characteristics, and are associated with worse ischaemic and haemorrhagic outcomes.",
