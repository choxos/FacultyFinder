  "abstract": "Left ventricular diverticulum is a rare congenital left ventricular outpouchings. The disease is often diagnosed during childhood because it is frequently associated with midline thoracoabdominal defects and other congenital cardiac anomalies. Most cases are asymptomatic, often discovered incidentally. Some complications have been reported including infarction, arrhythmia, heart failure. The most severe complication is rupture of the diverticulum, which can cause a patient's death. Therefore, this congenital defect should be detected early to assess potential risks for appropriate treatment. In this article, we report a case of a 3-month-old boy with left ventricular diverticulum diagnosed with Doppler ultrasound and cardiac MSCT. Complete resection was undertaken. The patient remained asymptomatic with good heart function 2 months after surgery.",
