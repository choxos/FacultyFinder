  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To describe the epidemiology, determinants and survival impact of gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). METHODS: Consecutive SSc patients prospectively enrolled in the Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study (ASCS) were included. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine the associations of GAVE with clinical manifestations and serological parameters. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves were used to estimate survival. RESULTS: The prevalence of GAVE in this SSc cohort of 2039 SSc patients was 10.6% (n = 216) over a median follow-up period of 4.3(1.7-8.4) years. SSc patients with a history of GAVE compared with those without a history of GAVE were older at SSc onset [49.5 (40.0-58.2) vs 46.7 (36.0-56.7) years, p = 0.05]; more likely to have diffuse disease subtype (dcSSc) (35.3% vs 24.1%, p < 0.001); be negative for Scl-70, U1RNP and Scl/PM antibody (4.0% vs 16.1%, p < 0.001, 3.5% vs 7.4%, p = 0.041, 0.0% vs 2.0%, p = 0.042; and respectively) and positive for RNAP III antibody (24.9% vs 8.3%, p < 0.001). Those with GAVE had a worse HRQoL (p = 0.002). Independent determinants of GAVE included the presence of RNAP III antibody (OR 3.46, p < 0.001), absence of Scl-70 antibody (OR 0.23, p = 0.001), presence of GIT dysmotility (OR 1.64, p = 0.004), and digital ulcers; pits; or digital amputation (OR 1.59, p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: GAVE is an underestimated and underappreciated SSc manifestation of SSc, which occurs with a relatively high frequency. Identifying an at-risk GAVE phenotype, as presented herein, is of practical importance as screening may prove advantageous given GAVE can be easily diagnosed and treated.",
