  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Prospective studies of encephalitis are rare in regions where encephalitis is prevalent, such as low middle-income Southeast Asian countries. We compared the diagnostic yield of local and advanced tests in cases of pediatric encephalitis in Myanmar. METHODS: Children with suspected subacute or acute encephalitis at Yangon Children's Hospital, Yangon, Myanmar, were prospectively recruited from 2016-2018. Cohort 1 (n = 65) had locally available diagnostic testing, whereas cohort 2 (n = 38) had advanced tests for autoantibodies (ie, cell-based assays, tissue immunostaining, studies with cultured neurons) and infections (ie, BioFire FilmArray multiplex Meningitis/Encephalitis multiplex PCR panel, metagenomic sequencing, and pan-viral serologic testing [VirScan] of cerebrospinal fluid). RESULTS: A total of 20 cases (13 in cohort 1 and 7 in cohort 2) were found to have illnesses other than encephalitis. Of the 52 remaining cases in cohort 1, 43 (83%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which 2 cases (4%) had a confirmed infectious etiology. Nine cases (17%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Of the 31 cases in cohort 2, 23 (74%) had presumed infectious encephalitis, of which one (3%) had confirmed infectious etiology using local tests only, whereas 8 (26%) had presumed autoimmune encephalitis. Advanced tests confirmed an additional 10 (32%) infections, 4 (13%) possible infections, and 5 (16%) cases of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antibody encephalitis. INTERPRETATION: Pediatric encephalitis is prevalent in Myanmar, and advanced technologies increase identification of treatable infectious and autoimmune causes. Developing affordable advanced tests to use globally represents a high clinical and research priority to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of encephalitis. ANN NEUROL 2023;93:615-628.",
