  "title": "\"Filling in the gap\": A qualitative case study about identity construction of siblings of youth with a neurodisability.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In families of children with a neurodisability, siblings have unique experiences that can shape their identity. There is limited information about the developmental process of how siblings form their identity. This study aims to understand the identity construction of young siblings who have a sibling with a neurodisability. METHODS: As part of a patient-oriented research program, we engaged with our Sibling Youth Advisory Council in Canada. In this qualitative case study, data from semi-structured interviews augmented by photo elicitation and graphic elicitation of relational maps were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Nineteen sibling participants (median age = 19 years, range = 14-33 years) reflected on the uniqueness of their role during childhood. During adolescence and emerging adulthood, they became closer with their sibling with a neurodisability and increased communication with their parents about how to care for their sibling with a neurodisability. These experiences influenced how they explored and began to reconcile their sibling identity with their professional and social identities. CONCLUSION: Siblings of youth with a neurodisability discover their unique identity and require support in this developmental process. Future interventions could evaluate how supports for siblings can have an impact on the positive development of their identity.",
