  "title": "How to perform an ultrasound to diagnose endometriosis.",
  "abstract": "Ultrasound has become an invaluable tool for the workup and management of patients with symptoms and signs of endometriosis. Until the publication on the systematic approach to ultrasound in patients with suspected endometriosis by the International Deep Endometriosis Analysis (IDEA) group, there was significant heterogeneity in the scientific literature in nomenclature, definitions and components of this particular scan. Despite the concise four steps outlined in their consensus statement, the nature of this ultrasound is advanced, complex and time consuming. Without intending to oversimplify the task, we propose a practical and comprehensive approach on how to perform an ultrasound scan to assess the pelvis of a woman with potential underlying endometriosis.",
