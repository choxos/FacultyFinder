  "title": "Implementation and Evaluation of a Multi-level, Place-Based Tobacco Prevention and Control Program at a Minority-Serving Institution in Texas.",
  "abstract": "Multi-level, place-based interventions have proven effective at promoting a range of health behaviors, including tobacco control and discouraging the uptake of tobacco products. This paper describes the implementation and impact of a 3-year, multi-level tobacco prevention and control program at a community-college minority-serving institution (MSI) on the Texas Gulf Coast within the context of a broader multi-sector, cross-functional health coalition. The intervention studied included a tobacco-free policy, a large-scale communication campaign highlighting parts of the intervention and prevention and cessation resources. The intervention was bolstered by the support of a community-led Steering Committee and tobacco control experts. Results from the first 3 years of implementation show that tobacco-free policies were largely supported by community members, awareness of the policy increased over time, and tobacco prevention and cessation resources were successfully embedded into campus norms. This multi-component approach shows how a community college was able to effectively reach students and staff on their campus to increase awareness of both the campus tobacco-free policy and the availability of tobacco prevention and cessation resources. Additionally, it also offers lessons for future tobacco prevention and control work in higher education.",
