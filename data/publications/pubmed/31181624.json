  "title": "Relationships between Atherosclerosis and Plasma Antioxidant Micronutrients or Red Blood Cell Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in People Living with HIV.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People living with human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) (PLWH) are at an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Diet-related factors may contribute. The aim of this pilot study was to determine, in PLWH, the relationship between atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and (A) plasma antioxidant micronutrients and oxidative stress or (B) red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids (RBC PUFA), particularly long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). METHODS: (A) In a cross-sectional study, subjects had CIMT evaluated by high resolution carotid artery ultrasound. Plasma was collected for vitamin C, measured by spectrophotometry; and alpha- and gamma-tocopherol, retinol, and malondialdehyde-a marker of oxidative stress-using high pressure liquid chromatography and fluorescence spectrophotometry. (B) In a prospective cohort study, other subjects had RBC PUFA measured at baseline, using gas chromatography, and CIMT assessed at baseline and repeated after 2 years. Clinical data was also collected. RESULTS: (A) 91 PLWH participated. Only alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels were positively correlated with CIMT. In a multivariate analysis, age and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with CIMT with gamma-tocopherol near significance (p = 0.053). (B) 69 PLWH participated. At baseline, docosahexaenoic acid (n-3 PUFA) and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (n-6 PUFA) were significantly and negatively correlated with CIMT. However, a multivariate analysis failed to detect a significant relationship either at baseline or 2 years after. CONCLUSION: In addition to age and systolic blood pressure, atherosclerosis assessed by CIMT might be associated with higher serum gamma-tocopherol levels. There was a non-significant association between CIMT and RBC n-3 PUFA or the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFA.",
