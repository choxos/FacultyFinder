  "title": "Targeting mitochondrial oxidative stress with MitoQ reduces NET formation and kidney disease in lupus-prone MRL-lpr mice.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recent investigations in humans and mouse models with lupus have revealed evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mROS) in T cells and neutrophils. This can provoke numerous cellular changes including oxidation of nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and even induction of cell death. We have previously observed that in T cells from patients with lupus, the increased mROS is capable of provoking oligomerisation of mitochondrial antiviral stimulator (MAVS) and production of type I interferon (IFN-I). mROS in SLE neutrophils also promotes the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which are increased in lupus and implicated in renal damage. As a result, in addition to traditional immunosuppression, more comprehensive treatments for lupus may also include non-immune therapy, such as antioxidants. METHODS: Lupus-prone MRL-lpr mice were treated from weaning for 11 weeks with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant, MitoQ (200 µM) in drinking water. Mice were then assessed for ROS production in neutrophils, NET formation, MAVS oligomerisation, serum IFN-I, autoantibody production and renal function. RESULTS: MitoQ-treated mice manifested reduced neutrophil ROS and NET formation, decreased MAVS oligomerisation and serum IFN-I, and reduced immune complex formation in kidneys, despite no change in serum autoantibody . CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal the potential utility of targeting mROS in addition to traditional immunosuppressive therapy for lupus.",
