  "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory vascular wall disease, and endothelial cell dysfunction plays an important role in its development and progression. Under the influence of laminar shear stress, however, the endothelium releases homeostatic factors such as nitric oxide and expresses of vasoprotective microRNAs that are resistant to atherosclerosis. Adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, exhibited on the endothelial surface, recruit monocytes that enter the vessel wall to form foam cells. Accumulation of these foam cells form fatty streaks that may progress to atherosclerotic plaques in the blood vessel wall. Interestingly, E-selectin may also serve as an affinity moiety for targeted drug delivery against atherosclerosis. We have recently developed an E-selectin-targeted platform that enriches therapeutic microRNAs in the inflamed endothelium to inhibit formation of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques.",
