  "title": "Mulberry Bark Alleviates Effect of STZ Inducing Diabetic Mice through Negatively Regulating FoxO1.",
  "abstract": "Dysfunction of insulin secretion and hyperglycaemia were commonly found due to damaged β cells of pancreas. In our previous research, it was found that mulberry branch bark powder (MBBP) was effective in treating diabetes in mice which were induced by STZ and high fat diet. The present study was designed to evaluate the protective effect of MBBP on STZ-induced β cells injury and investigate underlying mechanisms. By preventive administration of branch bark powder, the damage caused by STZ injection was found to be alleviated. In MBBP feed groups, pathological weight loss was inhibited, fasting blood glucose was controlled, the incidence of diabetes decreased, and blood lipid level and antioxidant capacities were restored. The PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signal pathway was found to be activated by key proteins expression and gene testing. In liver, the increased PI3K and phosphorylated AKT, the phosphorylated, and inactivated FoxO1, which regulates the expression of gluconeogenic gene and explains the effect of relieving insulin resistance of MBBP. Therefore, the MBBP improves the tolerance of pancreas to the toxicity of STZ involving the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signalling pathway.",
