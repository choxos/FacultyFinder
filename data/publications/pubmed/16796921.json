  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine whether there is an association essential hypertension pressure and a polymorphic Hind III biallelic marker in the non-recombining region of Y chromosome in Chinese Han people. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 402 males with essential hypertension pressure and 455 age- and body height-matched healthy males as control group. Genomic DNA was extracted from the white blood cells. Segments of polymorphic Hind III restriction site of the Y chromosome were amplified from the genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were restricted with 10 U of Hind III overnight at 37 degrees C. The digested products were subjected to electrophoresis in 3% agarose gels, and stained with ethidium bromide. RESULTS: The Hind III (+) genotype was found in 58.5% of the men with essential hypertension (235/402), significantly lower than that in the healthy men (64.4%, 302/455, P = 0.02). The systolic blood pressure of the men with Hind III (+) genotype was 133.8 mm Hg +/- 25.2 mm Hg, significantly lower than that of the Hind III (-) genotype (138.0 mm Hg +/- 27.0 mm Hg, P < 0.05), and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of the men with Hind III (+) genotype was 83.5 mm Hg +/- 13.3 mm Hg, significantly lower than that of the men with Hind III (-) genotype (85.9 mm Hg +/- 14.4 mm Hg, P = 0.01), and the mean arterial pressure of the men with Hind III (+) genotype was 100.2 mm Hg +/- 16.5 mm Hg, significantly lower than that of the of the men with Hind III (+) genotype was (103.3 mm Hg +/- 17.6 mm Hg, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Polymorphic Hind III restriction site of the Y chromosome is associated with essential hypertension in Chinese Han people.",
