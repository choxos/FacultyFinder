  "title": "Creating and Activating an Implementation Community to Drive HPV Vaccine Uptake in Texas: The Role of an NCI-Designated Cancer Center.",
  "abstract": "The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a comprehensive cancer center designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), defines its service population area as the State of Texas (29.1 M), the second most populous state in the country and the state with the greatest number of uninsured residents in the United States. Consistent with a novel and formal commitment to prevention as part of its core mission, alongside clear opportunities in Texas to drive vaccine uptake, MD Anderson assembled a transdisciplinary team to develop an institutional Framework to increase adolescent HPV vaccination and reduce HPV-related cancer burden. The Framework was developed and activated through a four-phase approach aligned with the NCI Cancer Center Support Grant Community Outreach and Engagement component. MD Anderson identified collaborators through data-driven outreach and constructed a portfolio of collaborative multi-sector initiatives through review processes designed to assess readiness, impact and sustainability. The result is an implementation community of 78 institutions collaboratively implementing 12 initiatives within a shared measurement framework impacting 18 counties. This paper describes a structured and rigorous process to set up the implementation of a multi-year investment in evidence-based strategies to increase HPV vaccination that solves challenges preventing implementation of recommended strategies and to encourage similar initiative replication.",
