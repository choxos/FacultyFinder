  "title": "Use of osteobiologics in the management of osteoporotic fractures.",
  "abstract": "Osteoporotic fractures present a number of significant challenges for surgical management, including high degrees of fracture comminution, poor implant fixation secondary to inferior bone quality, and compromised capacity for fracture healing. Osteobiologics are materials/agents that can promote fracture healing and enhance fracture stability. Given the challenges presented by osteoporotic fractures, they seem ideally suited to potentially benefit from the application of osteobiologics. Despite this, limited clinical investigation into the use of osteobiologics in the management of osteoporotic fractures has been performed. This article reviews a select number of osteobiologic products and the evidence for their use in osteoporotic fractures.",
