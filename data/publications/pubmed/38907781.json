  "title": "\"Bottom of My Own List:\" Barriers and Facilitators to Mental Health Support Use in Caregivers of Children with Neurodevelopmental Support Needs.",
  "abstract": "This study investigated barriers and facilitators to mental health service use (e.g., interventions, educational programs) in caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or neurodevelopmental problems, as they experience high levels of distress and low help-seeking behaviour. Caregivers of children aged 0 to 12 with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or neurodevelopmental problems (N = 78) completed a mixed-method online survey about their mental health and service use. Caregiver-reported psychological distress and mental health service use were positively correlated. Most participants (66.2%) were above the clinical cut-off score for anxiety, depression, or caregiving stress; of these participants, 45.7% had not accessed mental health services for themselves within the past year. Lack of time and difficulties arranging childcare were noted barriers; patient-oriented suggestions for service improvement were provided. The findings add novel information on factors to increase mental health service use in this population. Recommendations for clinical practice for those practitioners who provide services for children with neurodevelopmental disorders and/or neurodevelopmental problems are included.",
