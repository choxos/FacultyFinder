  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) disproportionately affects women of childbearing age. However, pregnancy and maternal outcomes for women with HS are unknown. OBJECTIVE: To compare risk of adverse pregnancy and maternal outcomes among women with and without HS and to evaluate the influence of comorbid conditions. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis between January 1, 2011, and September 30, 2015. RESULTS: Compared to control pregnancies (n = 64,218), HS pregnancies (n = 1862) had a higher risk of spontaneous abortion (15.5% vs 11.3%), preterm birth (9.1% vs 6.7%), gestational diabetes mellitus (11.6% vs 8.4%), gestational hypertension (6.1% vs 4.4%), preeclampsia (6.6% vs 3.8%), and cesarean section (32.4% vs 27.1%). Relative risk of some pregnancy and maternal outcomes were attenuated after comorbidity adjustment. In the fully adjusted model, HS pregnancies were independently associated with spontaneous abortion (odds ratio, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.38), gestational diabetes mellitus (odds ratio, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.07-1.48), and cesarean section (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.004-1.17). LIMITATIONS: We could not evaluate potential influences of disease duration, activity, or severity. Newborn outcomes could not be evaluated. CONCLUSION: HS appears to be an independent risk factor for adverse pregnancy and maternal outcomes. This risk is influenced by comorbidities that may be modifiable with early identification and management.",
