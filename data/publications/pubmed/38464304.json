  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The visual world is richly adorned with texture, which can serve to delineate important elements of natural scenes. In anesthetized macaque monkeys, selectivity for the statistical features of natural texture is weak in V1, but substantial in V2, suggesting that neuronal activity in V2 might directly support texture perception. To test this, we investigated the relation between single cell activity in macaque V1 and V2 and simultaneously measured behavioral judgments of texture. We generated stimuli along a continuum between naturalistic texture and phase-randomized noise and trained two macaque monkeys to judge whether a sample texture more closely resembled one or the other extreme. Analysis of responses revealed that individual V1 and V2 neurons carried much less information about texture naturalness than behavioral reports. However, the sensitivity of V2 neurons, especially those preferring naturalistic textures, was significantly closer to that of behavior compared with V1. The firing of both V1 and V2 neurons predicted perceptual choices in response to repeated presentations of the same ambiguous stimulus in one monkey, despite low individual neural sensitivity. However, neither population predicted choice in the second monkey. We conclude that neural responses supporting texture perception likely continue to develop downstream of V2. Further, combined with neural data recorded while the same two monkeys performed an orientation discrimination task, our results demonstrate that choice-correlated neural activity in early sensory cortex is unstable across observers and tasks, untethered from neuronal sensitivity, and thus unlikely to reflect a critical aspect of the formation of perceptual decisions. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As visual signals propagate along the cortical hierarchy, they encode increasingly complex aspects of the sensory environment and likely have a more direct relationship with perceptual experience. We replicate and extend previous results from anesthetized monkeys differentiating the selectivity of neurons along the first step in cortical vision from area V1 to V2. However, our results further complicate efforts to establish neural signatures that reveal the relationship between perception and the neuronal activity of sensory populations. We find that choice-correlated activity in V1 and V2 is unstable across different observers and tasks, and also untethered from neuronal sensitivity and other features of nonsensory response modulation.",
