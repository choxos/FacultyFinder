  "title": "Endoplasmic reticulum stress as a driver and therapeutic target for kidney disease.",
  "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has crucial roles in metabolically active cells, including protein translation, protein folding and quality control, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium homeostasis. Adverse metabolic conditions or pathogenic genetic variants that cause misfolding and accumulation of proteins within the ER of kidney cells initiate an injurious process known as ER stress that contributes to kidney disease and its cardiovascular complications. Initiation of ER stress activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), a cellular defence mechanism that functions to restore ER homeostasis. However, severe or chronic ER stress rewires the UPR to activate deleterious pathways that exacerbate inflammation, apoptosis and fibrosis, resulting in kidney injury. This insidious crosstalk between ER stress, UPR activation, oxidative stress and inflammation forms a vicious cycle that drives kidney disease and vascular damage. Furthermore, genetic variants that disrupt protein-folding mechanisms trigger ER stress, as evidenced in autosomal-dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease and Fabry disease. Emerging therapeutic strategies that enhance protein-folding capacity and reduce the burden of ER stress have shown promising results in kidney diseases. Thus, integrating knowledge of how genetic variants cause protein misfolding and ER stress into clinical practice will enhance treatment strategies and potentially improve outcomes for various kidney diseases and their vascular complications.",
