  "title": "Older adults in social housing: A systemically vulnerable population that needs to be prioritized.",
  "abstract": "Older adults living in social housing are a vulnerable population with unique health challenges that often lead to poor health outcomes and high emergency service utilization. However, the needs of this population are frequently overlooked. This policy note describes the characteristics of older adults living in social housing in Canada and discusses why they are a vulnerable, underserved population in need of immediate attention and priority. Older adults in social housing have higher rates of chronic disease, lower quality of life, and lower health literacy and face challenges caused by various compounding social determinants of health. There is a large gap in research and tailored interventions focusing on this population. Based on these findings, the authors highlight the need for the allocation of resources to support this growing population, including dedicated funding, research, and programming. Proactively addressing the issues that exist in the health and social care of this high-needs population will also have larger implications for reducing healthcare system burden.",
