  "abstract": "Bariatric/metabolic surgery has emerged as an option for significant and durable weight loss in the treatment of clinically severe obesity; there is increasing demand for bariatric/metabolic surgery worldwide. New procedures have been developed and changed the face of modern bariatric surgery.
