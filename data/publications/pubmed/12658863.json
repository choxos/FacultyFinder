  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This article assesses the validity of prescription drug insurance coverage as self-reported in the 1996/97 National Population Health Survey (NPHS). DATA SOURCE: The data are from the cross-sectional household component of Statistics Canada's 1996/97 NPHS. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES: Most seniors and all social assistance recipients are entitled to prescription drug benefits from their provincial governments. For NPHS respondents eligible for such benefits, the percentage reporting coverage in 1996/97 was calculated. Logit regression was used to assess the determinants of self-reported coverage. MAIN RESULTS: Only 51% of seniors and 46% of social assistance recipients who were eligible for provincial benefits reported drug insurance coverage in 1996/97. The probability of reporting coverage was generally higher in provinces with drug programs that did not impose deductibles.",
