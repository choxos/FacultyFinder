  "title": "Considerations for use of direct oral anticoagulants in arterial disease.",
  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases including coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease were responsible for an estimated 18 million deaths in 2017. Despite advances in management over the past several decades, these patients continue to have substantial risk of subsequent cardiovascular events. We provide a narrative review of randomized clinical trials evaluating direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes, noncardioembolic ischemic stroke, embolic stroke of undetermined source, and peripheral arterial disease. In these conditions, considerations for use of single antiplatelet therapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or low-dose DOACs used together with antiplatelet therapy are presented.",
