  "abstract": "Data evaluating the screening practices for viral hepatitides and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) in patients presenting for non-occupational HIV post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) care are limited. Screening practices and prevalences of viral hepatitides and STIs were evaluated in 126 patients presenting to a dedicated HIV prevention clinic for HIV nPEP. Three patients (2.4%) were diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C infection, 28 (22.2%) did not have surface antibodies in sufficient quantity to confer immunity to hepatitis B, and six (4.8%) were diagnosed with an STI. A multivariate regression model did not predict any demographic or clinical features predictive of HBV non-immunity. Beyond screening for HIV infection, evaluation for viral hepatitides and STIs is an important feature in the care of patients presenting for HIV nPEP.",
