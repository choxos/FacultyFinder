  "title": "Pulsed electric field effect on acrylamide reduction and quality attributes of continuous-style Lamoka potato chips.",
  "abstract": "Potato chips are a popular snack, well-liked because of their texture-flavor combination. Potato chips are made by frying slices of potato in vegetable oil to achieve a crispy texture. Frying potato slices initiates the Maillard reaction, resulting in chemical changes that enhance taste, color, and texture, but also undesired acrylamides, which are suspected carcinogens. The application of pulsed electric field (PEF) technology is commonly used in French fry processing operations to prolong cutting blade sharpness and reduce waste, energy consumption, and water usage. Despite these attributes, PEF systems have not yet gained widespread adoption by potato chip producers. In the current study, Lamoka potatoes were PEF-treated prior to continuous frying into potato chips. The effect of specific energy at 0.75 kJ/kg (Low-PEF) and 1.5 kJ/kg (High-PEF) and electric field strength of 1 kV/cm, frequency of 24 kV, and pulse width of 6 μs versus untreated (control) samples was studied, then batches of 250 g of slices were fried at 170 °C or 185 °C for two frying times to obtain potato chips with acrylamide levels below the California Proposition 65 limit (275 ng/g). The Lamoka potato chip product quality metrics that were assessed include moisture, fat, reducing sugars, asparagine, acrylamide, chip color, and texture. PEF treatment of Lamoka potatoes resulted in chips fried in 10 % less time, lower oil content by 8 %, and a decrease of reducing sugars by 19.2 %, asparagine by 42.0 %, and acrylamide by 28.9 %. The PEF fried chips were lighter in color but maintained textural attributes compared to continuous frying cooking. The process of frying potato slices at 170 °C for 150 s with High-PEF yielded potato chips with acrylamide content below the California Proposition 65 limit; which speaks to the health implications for consumers and the quality and safety of these chips.",
