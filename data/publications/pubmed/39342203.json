  "title": "Impact of baseline FIB-4 score on efpeglenatide benefits on cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes: a participant-level exploratory analysis of the AMPLITUDE-O trial.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: To estimate the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), expanded MACE, and MACE or Death across Fibrosis- 4 score (FIB-4) categories in people with type 2 diabetes and to determine whether efpeglenatide's effect varies with increasing FIB-4 severity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AMPLITUDE-O trial data were used to estimate the relationship of FIB-4 score categories to the hazard of MACE, expanded MACE, and MACE or death. Interactions on these outcomes between baseline FIB-4 score, and between FIB-4 score and efpeglenatide were also assessed. RESULTS: Baseline FIB-4 score was available for 4059 participants (99.6%) allowing subdivision of the population in tertiles. During a median follow-up of 1.8 years, numerical increases in the incidence of all 3 outcomes did not change significantly across tertiles of FIB-4 score (P for trend ≥ 0.25) with negligible relationship of the score to incident outcomes (MACE HR, per 1 SD higher score, 95% CI: 1.00, 0.89-1.13). Efpeglenatide's effect on all MACE outcomes did not vary across FIB-4 tertiles (all interaction p values ≥ 0.64). CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk people with type 2 diabetes, the degree of liver fibrosis, as estimated by FIB-4 score, was not related to incident cardiovascular outcomes. The beneficial effect of efpeglenatide on these outcomes is independent of FIB-4 category.",
