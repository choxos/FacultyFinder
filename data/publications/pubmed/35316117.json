  "title": "Mobilizing Forward: An Interpretive Description of Supporting Successful Neonatal Intensive Care Unit-To-Home Transitions for Adolescent Parents.",
  "abstract": "Pregnancy and parenting in adolescence and the transition home following the hospitalization of an infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are two relatively complex phenomena; and whilst each have been consistently explored within the relevant literature, little is understood about the care required when they intersect. Using interpretive description methodology to guide our exploration, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 expert providers caring for adolescent parents involved in NICU-to-home transitions to describe this process in their practice. Findings suggest that supporting successful NICU-to-home transitions for adolescent parents relied strongly on understanding the impact of the NICU experience, establishing therapeutic relationships and facilitating supportive partnerships between the NICU and parents as well as the NICU and supportive services post-discharge. Findings highlight the opportunity for more integrated models of care within the NICU and extending into the community to address the complex biopsychosocial care needs of this parent population.",
