  "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterised by a preoccupation with a perceived defect in appearance. This preoccupation results in the completion of repetitive/time consuming behaviours to reduce distress. While the disorder results in considerable distress and impairment, the prevalence of the disorder is largely unknown, as BDD has not been examined in large epidemiological studies. The aim of the current study was to provide an estimate of BDD prevalence in a variety of settings using a meta-analytic approach using only studies that have made a diagnosis using a structured diagnostic interview. Twenty-two studies met criteria (n = 7159) and the pooled point-prevalence estimate for BDD was 11.3% across all studies with high levels of heterogeneity (I[2] = 95.81). The pooled point-prevalence estimate was 20.0% in cosmetic/dermatology settings, 7.4% in mental health settings, and 6.7% in 'other' settings (including students and professional ballet dancers). The risk of bias assessment indicated questionable methodological quality in some of the included studies. While this study provides an important improvement on the existing literature there is a need to include BDD in epidemiological studies in order to have a more accurate understanding of the prevalence rate of this mental health condition in the community.",
