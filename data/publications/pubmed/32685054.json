  "title": "Assessment of Serum Tumor Markers for Predicting Ocular Metastasis in Lung Adenocarcinoma: A Retrospective Study.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to detect clinical variations between lung adenocarcinoma patients with and without ocular metastasis (OM) to identify risk factors for OM and assess the diagnostic values. We included 1153 patients with lung adenocarcinoma in this study. Independent t-tests and chi-square tests were used to compare patients' clinical characteristics. Statistically significant parameters were analyzed by binary logistic regression to detect risk factors of OM. The results showed that the OM group had increased alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin fragment 19 (CYFRA 21-1), carbohydrate antigen- (CA-) 125, CA-153, and total prostate-specific antigen (TPSA) compared with the NOM group. CYFRA21-1 is the most useful biomarker for detecting OM in this population.",
