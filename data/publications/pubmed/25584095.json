  "title": "Bioactive indole alkaloids isolated from Alstonia angustifolia.",
  "abstract": "Bioassay-guided fractionation was conducted on a CHCl3-soluble extract of the stem bark of Alstonia angustifolia (Apocynaceae) collected in Vietnam using the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line, and led to the isolation of a new sarpagine-type indole alkaloid (1), together with nine known alkaloids, including four macroline-derived alkaloids (2-5), a sarpagine-type alkaloid (6), and four macroline-pleiocarpamine bisindole alkaloids (7-10). The structure of the new compound (1) was determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. Compounds 1-10 were evaluated in vitro for their NF-κB (p65) inhibitory activity against the Hela cells in an ELISA assay. The new sarpagine alkaloid, N(4)-methyltalpinine (1), was found to show significant NF-κB inhibitory activity (ED50 = 1.2 µM). Furthermore, all the isolates (1-10) were evaluated in vitro for their antileishmanial activity, and compounds (1-4, 6 and 8-10) exhibited leishmaniacidal activity against promastigotes of Leishmania mexicana.",
