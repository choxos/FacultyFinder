  "title": "Serotonin Syndrome in the Emergency Department.",
  "abstract": "With the widespread use of serotonergic agents including many antidepressants, antiemetics, illicit drugs, and even some herbal supplements, serotonin syndrome is a condition seen more frequently. It can appear abruptly and, if untreated, can progress to a life-threatening state. Prompt recognition and treatment is imperative to avoid complications. The presentation is variable and can be confused with other conditions. The authors present a case of serotonin syndrome that was recognized early and treated promptly in the emergency department.",
