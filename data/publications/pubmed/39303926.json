  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to elucidate the association between serum levels of circular RNAs circ_0001879 and circ_0004104 and the occurrence of coronary microcirculation disorders along with post-PCI prognosis in individuals with stable coronary heart disease. METHODS: A cohort of 92 patients diagnosed with stable coronary heart disease and subjected to PCI between June 2020 and June 2022 at our institution was assembled. Patients were categorized into an exposed group (n = 60) and a non-exposed group (n = 32), predicated on the coronary angiography-derived microcirculation resistance index (caIMR). RESULTS: Comparative analysis revealed significantly elevated levels of circ_0001879 and circ_0004104 in the serum of the exposed group compared to the non-exposed group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Post-PCI, both caFFR and caIMR values demonstrated a marked increase in comparison to pre-surgical measurements within both groups, with the exposed group exhibiting lower indices post-surgery relative to the non-exposed group, indicative of superior microcirculatory outcomes (P < 0.05). Furthermore, serum levels of circ_0001879 and circ_0004104 were inversely correlated with favorable prognosis, with lower levels observed in patients with positive outcomes (P < 0.05). The predictive accuracy for poor prognosis, as indicated by the area under the curve (AUC), was enhanced when circ_0001879 and circ_0004104 were considered in tandem (AUC = 0.934), surpassing the predictive power of individual assessments (Z combination vs circ_0001879 = 2.439, Z combination vs circ_0004104 = 2.317, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Elevated serum levels of circ_0001879 and circ_0004104 are observed in stable coronary heart disease patients and are significantly associated with the presence of coronary microcirculation disorders and post-PCI prognosis, underscoring their potential as prognostic biomarkers.",
