  "title": "Reference Interval Harmonization: Harnessing the Power of Big Data Analytics to Derive Common Reference Intervals across Populations and Testing Platforms.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Harmonization in laboratory medicine is essential for consistent and accurate clinical decision-making. There is significant and unwarranted variation in reference intervals (RIs) used by laboratories for assays with established analytical traceability. The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists (CSCC) Working Group on Reference Interval Harmonization (hRI-WG) aims to establish harmonized RIs (hRIs) for laboratory tests and support implementation. METHODS: Harnessing the power of big data, laboratory results were collected across populations and testing platforms to derive common adult RIs for 16 biochemical markers. A novel comprehensive approach was established, including: (a) analysis of big data from community laboratories across Canada; (b) statistical evaluation of age, sex, and analytical differences; (c) derivation of hRIs using the refineR method; and (d) verification of proposed hRIs across 9 laboratories with different instrumentation using serum and plasma samples collected from healthy Canadian adults. RESULTS: Harmonized RIs were calculated for all assays using the refineR method, except free thyroxine. Derived hRIs met proposed verification criterion across 9 laboratories and 5 manufacturers for alkaline phosphatase, albumin (bromocresol green), chloride, lactate dehydrogenase, magnesium, phosphate, potassium (serum), and total protein (serum). Further investigation is needed for some analytes due to failure to meet verification criteria in one or more laboratories (albumin [bromocresol purple], calcium, total carbon dioxide, total bilirubin, and sodium) or concern regarding excessively wide hRIs (alanine aminotransferase, creatinine, and thyroid stimulating hormone). CONCLUSIONS: We report a novel data-driven approach for RI harmonization. Findings support feasibility of RI harmonization for several analytes; however, some presented challenges, highlighting limitations that need to be considered in harmonization and big data analytics.",
