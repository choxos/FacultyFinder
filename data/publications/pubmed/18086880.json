  "title": "ARS2 is a conserved eukaryotic gene essential for early mammalian development.",
  "abstract": "Determining the functions of novel genes implicated in cell survival is directly relevant to our understanding of mammalian development and carcinogenesis. ARS2 is an evolutionarily conserved gene that confers arsenite resistance on arsenite-sensitive Chinese hamster ovary cells. Little is known regarding the function of ARS2 in mammals. We report that ARS2 is transcribed throughout embryonic development and is expressed ubiquitously in mouse and human tissues. The mouse ARS2 protein is predominantly localized to the nucleus, and this nuclear localization is ablated in ARS2-null embryos, which in turn die around the time of implantation. After 24 h of culture, ARS2-null blastocysts contained a significantly greater number of apoptotic cells than wild-type or heterozygous blastocysts. By 48 h of in vitro culture, null blastocysts invariably collapsed and failed to proliferate. These data indicate ARS2 is essential for early mammalian development and is likely involved in an essential cellular process. The analysis of data from several independent protein-protein interaction studies in mammals, combined with functional studies of its Arabidopsis ortholog, SERRATE, suggests that this essential process is related to RNA metabolism.",
