  "title": "Child burn injury in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: results from a community survey.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to identify the incidence of burn injuries among children in a sub-Saharan urban area and describe contributing factors in the home environment. A cross-sectional household survey was conducted in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania between 8 and 22 July 2009. Demographic characteristics of participants were reported using descriptive statistics. Bivariate analyses using Pearson's chi-square tests for categorical variables were used to explore possible associations. Burns represented 16.3% of reported injuries. The one-month incidence was calculated to be 1.73%. The most common contributor to burn injury was open flame 36.9%, followed by hot liquids 33.8%. Most burns occurred in urban areas with 88% occurring in the home. A significant association with burn injury was found in the 0-4 age category. There exists a continued need for research examining the mechanisms of safety provision in the home in low resource settings, especially concerning burn injury.",
