  "abstract": "Emotional intimacy is key to intimate partner relationship quality and satisfaction. For sexual minority men, queer and feminist theorists consistently link emotional intimacy to diverse sexual practices and partnership dynamics formulated within the relationship. This Photovoice study adds to those insights by drawing on individual photovoice interviews with 16 sexual minority men to describe participant's experiences of, and strategies for emotional intimacy in their intimate relationships. Analysis revealed three distinct yet entwined themes: (i) embracing vulnerabilities to drive self-acceptance; (ii) building relationality with partners; and (iii) securing connections with family, friends and community. By embracing vulnerabilities to drive self-acceptance, participants spoke to embodied courage and autonomy as key components for addressing wide-ranging emotional intimacy challenges in their relationships. In theme two, building relationality with partners, participants described how empathy, trust and reciprocity underpinned collaborative work to foster emotional intimacy. Lastly, in securing connections with family, friends and community, acceptance and inclusion were key to participants' sense of belonging and legitimacy which aided their emotional intimacy with partners. The findings provide guidance for tailored programmatic efforts to assist sexual minority men build intimate relationships.",
