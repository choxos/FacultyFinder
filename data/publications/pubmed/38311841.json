  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study (RFGES) found that 40.3% of adults in 26 internet-surveyed countries met Rome IV criteria for disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI). However, additional people not meeting DGBI criteria may also be burdened by frequent gastrointestinal symptoms. AIMS: To explore the prevalence and demographic distribution of sub-diagnostic gastrointestinal symptoms, and the hypothesised associated effects on quality of life (QoL), life functioning and healthcare needs. METHODS: We analysed data from the RFGES survey, which included the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire and QoL, psychological, work productivity and healthcare questions. RESULTS: Of the 50,033 people without a history of organic gastrointestinal disorders, 25.3% classified in the sub-diagnostic group (no DGBI but one or more frequent gastrointestinal symptoms), 41.4% had DGBI and 33.4% had no frequent gastrointestinal symptoms (non-GI group). Sub-diagnostic prevalence in different world regions ranged from 22.2% (North America) to 30.5% (Middle East), was slightly higher among males than females and decreased with age. The sub-diagnostic group was intermediate between the non-GI and DGBI groups, and significantly different from both of them on QoL, anxiety, depression, somatisation, healthcare utilisation and life and work impairment. CONCLUSIONS: One in four adults without organic gastrointestinal disorders or DGBI report frequent gastrointestinal symptoms. This sub-diagnostic group has reduced QoL, greater psychological and non-GI bodily symptoms, impaired work productivity and life activities and greater healthcare use compared to non-GI individuals. This suggests that many in this sub-diagnostic group might benefit from healthcare services or symptom self-management advice.",
