  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy is a recognised safe, alternative strategy when a critical view of safety cannot be obtained. This study audits the change in practice at a District General Hospital following the adoption of subtotal cholecystectomy in 2013. METHODS: Retrospective case series included consecutive cholecystectomies over a ten-year period in a single institution. Cases were divided into subgroups based on operation date. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients undergoing laparoscopic total cholecystectomy, laparoscopic subtotal and laparoscopic converted to open cholecystectomy. Secondary outcomes included incidence of bile leak, complication rate, return to theatre, and length of stay. RESULTS: There were 4217 cases: 1381 in Group A (pre-adoption of subtotal cholecystectomy 2009-2012), and 2836 in Group B (post-adoption of subtotal cholecystectomy 2013-2019). The rate of laparoscopic total cholecystectomy was higher in Group A than Group B (95.4% vs. 92.8%, p < 0.001). In the subtotal group (n = 114, 14 (12.3%) patients had bile leak, 6 (5.3%) underwent re-laparoscopy, and median length of stay was 2 days. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic subtotal cholecystectomy appears to be an acceptable alternative technique at this centre, reducing the rate of open conversion and length of stay, with a low reintervention rate for bile leak.",
