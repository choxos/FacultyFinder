  "title": "De novo activating mutations drive clonal evolution and enhance clonal fitness in KMT2A-rearranged leukemia.",
  "abstract": "Activating signaling mutations are common in acute leukemia with KMT2A (previously MLL) rearrangements (KMT2A-R). These mutations are often subclonal and their biological impact remains unclear. Using a retroviral acute myeloid mouse leukemia model, we demonstrate that FLT3 [ITD] , FLT3 [N676K] , and NRAS [G12D] accelerate KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia onset. Further, also subclonal FLT3 [N676K] mutations accelerate disease, possibly by providing stimulatory factors. Herein, we show that one such factor, MIF, promotes survival of mouse KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia initiating cells. We identify acquired de novo mutations in Braf, Cbl, Kras, and Ptpn11 in KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemia cells that favored clonal expansion. During clonal evolution, we observe serial genetic changes at the Kras [G12D] locus, consistent with a strong selective advantage of additional Kras [G12D] . KMT2A-MLLT3 leukemias with signaling mutations enforce Myc and Myb transcriptional modules. Our results provide new insight into the biology of KMT2A-R leukemia with subclonal signaling mutations and highlight the importance of activated signaling as a contributing driver.",
