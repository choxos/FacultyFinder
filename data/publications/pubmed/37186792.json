  "title": "Exploring Distress and Occupational Participation Among Older Canadians During the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
  "abstract": "Background. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic disrupted daily life with corresponding implications on levels of distress. Purpose. To describe factors associated with high distress among community-dwelling older adults during the first lockdown and explore how occupational participation was managed. Methods. A mixed methods design whereby multivariate regression analysis of a survey (N = 263) identified factors associated with high distress, as per the Impact of Events of Scale-Revised (IES-R). Follow-up interviews with a sub-sample of those surveyed who reflected a range of IES-R scores were conducted (N = 32). Findings. Those with lower resilience and anxiety/depression had 6.84 and 4.09 greater odds respectively of high distress. From the interviews, the main theme, \"Lost and Found,\" and subthemes (Interruption and Disruption; Surving, not Thriving; Moving Forward, Finding Meaning) highlighted the process and corresponding stages, including adaptive strategies, by which participants navigated changes in their occupational participation. Implications. While the results suggest that many older adults, including those with high distress, were able to manage daily life under lockdown, some experienced ongoing challenges in doing so. Future studies should focus on those who experienced or who are at-higher risk for such challenges to identify supports that mitigate adverse consequences if another event of this magnitude occurs again.",
