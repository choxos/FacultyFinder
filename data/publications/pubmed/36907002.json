  "title": "Who are Australia's young heavy drinkers? a cross-sectional population study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: In light of the recent declines in youth drinking, the socio-demographic correlates of (1) annual total alcohol consumption (volume) and (2) monthly single occasion risky drinking among underage young people (14-17-year-olds) and young adults (18-24-year-olds) were examined. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were drawn from the 2019 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (n=1,547). Multivariable negative binomial regression analyses identified the socio-demographic correlates of total annual volume and monthly risky drinking. RESULTS: Those who spoke English as first language reported higher total volume and rates of monthly risky drinking. Not being in school predicted total volume for 14-17-year-olds, as did having a certificate/diploma for 18-24-year-olds. Living in affluent areas predicted a greater total volume for both age groups, and risky drinking for 18-24-year-olds. Young men in regional areas and working in labour and logistics reported higher total volume than young women in the same groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are important differences among young heavy drinkers related to gender, cultural background, socio-economic status, education, regionality and work industry. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH: Prevention strategies that are sensitively tailored towards high risk groups (e.g. young men in regional areas and working in trade and logistics) may be of public health benefit.",
