  "title": "The Use of Motion Analysis as Particle Biomarkers in Lensless Optofluidic Projection Imaging for Point of Care Urine Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Urine testing is an essential clinical diagnostic tool. The presence of urine sediments, typically analyzed through microscopic urinalysis or cell culture, can be indicative of many diseases, including bacterial, parasitic, and yeast infections, as well as more serious conditions like bladder cancer. Current urine analysis diagnostic methods are usually centralized and limited by high cost, inconvenience, and poor sensitivity. Here, we developed a lensless projection imaging optofluidic platform with motion-based particle analysis to rapidly detect urinary constituents without the need for concentration or amplification through culture. A removable microfluidics channel ensures that urine samples do not cross contaminate and the lens-free projection video is captured and processed by a low-cost integrated microcomputer. A motion tracking and analysis algorithm is developed to identify and track moving objects in the flow. Their motion characteristics are used as biomarkers to detect different urine species in near real-time. The results show that this technology is capable of detection of red and white blood cells, Trichomonas vaginalis, crystals, casts, yeast and bacteria. This cost-effective device has the potential to be implemented for timely, point-of-care detection of a wide range of disorders in hospitals, clinics, long-term care homes, and in resource-limited regions.",
