  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the microstructural optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence imaging predictors of visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and aniseikonia following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair. METHODS: This is a multicenter retrospective study of patients with primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment who underwent repair. Best-corrected visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and aniseikonia were formally tested at 3 months postoperatively. Metamorphopsia and aniseikonia were quantitatively assessed with M-CHARTS and the New Aniseikonia Test, respectively. High-resolution spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence images were obtained at 3 months postoperatively. Images were assessed for discontinuity of the outer retinal bands on optical coherence tomography and retinal displacement detected by retinal vessel printings on fundus autofluorescence by two masked graders with disagreements adjudicated by a third senior masked grader. Multiple linear regression models were used to determine the predictors of postoperative visual acuity, metamorphopsia, and aniseikonia. RESULTS: Six hundred fourteen eyes of 614 patients were included in this study. Regression analysis indicated that significant early postoperative (at 3 months) imaging predictors of visual acuity were discontinuity of the external limiting membrane (P = 0.001) and the presence of retinal vessel printings on fundus autofluorescence (P = 0.033). Discontinuity of interdigitation zone was a significant predictor of metamorphopsia [horizontal metamorphopsia (P =0.004); vertical metamorphopsia (P = 0.056); average of horizontal metamorphopsia + vertical metamorphopsia (P = 0.008)], and presence of retinal vessel printings was a significant predictor of aniseikonia (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Discontinuity of the external limiting membrane and retinal displacement were significant predictors of postoperative visual acuity following rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair. Discontinuity of the interdigitation zone and retinal displacement were significant predictors of metamorphopsia and aniseikonia, respectively.",
