  "title": "Chinese expert consensus on the management of hypertension in adults with type 2 diabetes.",
  "abstract": "Both hypertension and type 2 diabetes are attributable to premature death, cardiovascular and kidney diseases with largely overlapping population. Followed the GRADE approach, this expert consensus aimed to reduce the cardiovascular and kidney death and disability due to hypertension and minimize the treatment burden in adults with type 2 diabetes. Through online survey and discussion, a multidisciplinary team comprehensively prioritized seven key guideline questions. Informed by the evidence synthesis and online discussion, the team developed 12 recommendations under the GRADE Evidence-to-decision (EtD) framework. The recommendations covered the screening of hypertension in adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes but not hypertension and the monitoring, lifestyle interventions, and medications in those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and hypertension.",
