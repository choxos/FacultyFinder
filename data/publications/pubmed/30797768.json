  "abstract": "Because of its non-invasive nature urine testing may enable increased screening for HPV in women who avoid cervical sampling. Comparisons have shown fewer HPV positives in urine. The objectives were to compare first-void urine (FVU) treated with proteinase K (PK) to untreated FVU and cervical samples collected from women attending a colposcopy clinic using an Aptima HPV mRNA assay, and comparing the HPV rates to cytology and pathology results. Female FVU (n = 433) was treated with Aptima Transfer Solution (ATS) containing PK within 24 h or after months of storage. Untreated female FVU samples were HPV-positive in 20.8-27.6% compared to 34.4-45.6% of ATS-treated FVU and 44.9-48.4% of PreservCyt samples. Good overall agreement for HR-HPV detection between ATS-FVU and PreservCyt was observed (81.1%; k 0.63). Validation of ATS treatment was performed on 356 male FVU, detecting 6.7% HPV positive compared to 3.4% of untreated samples (p = 0.059). Although HPV presence in ATS FVU and PreservCyt samples were similar, significantly more women with abnormal cervical cytology and histopathology were HPV-positive in cervical specimens than in ATS-treated FVU.",
