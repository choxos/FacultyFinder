  "title": "Templating in shoulder arthroplasty - A comparison of 2D CT to 3D CT planning software: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Computed tomography (CT) utilizing computer software technology to generate three-dimensional (3D) rendering of the glenoid has become the preferred method for preoperative planning. It remains largely unknown what benefits this software may have to the intraoperative placement of the components and patient outcomes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review is to compare 2D CT to 3D CT planning in total shoulder arthroplasty. STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: A systematic database search was conducted for relevant studies evaluating the role of 3D CT planning in total shoulder arthroplasty. The primary outcome was component placement variability, and the secondary outcomes were intra- and inter-observer reliability in the context of preoperative planning. RESULTS: Following title-abstract and full-text screening, six eligible studies were included in the review (n = 237). The variability in glenoid measurements between 3D CT and 2D CT planning ranged from no significant difference to a 5° difference in version and 1.7° difference in inclination (p<0.05). Posterior bone loss was underestimated in 52% of the 2D measured patients relative to 3D CT groups. Irrespective of 2D and 3D planning (39% and 43% of cases respectively), surgeons elected to implant larger components than those templated. There was no literature identified comparing differences in time, cost, functional outcomes, complications, or patient satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The paucity of evidence exploring clinical parameters makes it difficult to comment on clinical outcomes using different methods of templating. More studies are required to identify how improved radiographic outcomes translate into improvements that are clinically meaningful to patients.",
