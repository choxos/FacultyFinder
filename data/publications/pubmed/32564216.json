  "title": "The Relationship Between Psychological Resilience and Pain Threshold and Tolerance: Optimism and Grit as Moderators.",
  "abstract": "This study examined factors that may enhance the relationship between resilience and time to pain threshold and tolerance during experimentally induced pain among 62 healthy adults recruited from a student population. Specifically, dispositional optimism and psychological grit were examined as moderators of the relationship between resilience and pain outcomes. Zero-order correlations revealed that resilience was positively related to grit and optimism, though grit and optimism were not significantly related to each other. Resilience, grit and optimism were all positively related to time to pain threshold and tolerance, but not pain severity. Moderation models showed that dispositional optimism enhanced the effect of resilience on both time to pain threshold and tolerance. Grit, on the other hand, was found to enhance the effect of resilience on time to pain threshold, but not time to pain tolerance. These results suggest that positive psychological factors and their interactions may be important with persevering during adverse experiences such as pain.",
