  "title": "Fondaparinux with UnfracTionated heparin dUring Revascularization in Acute coronary syndromes (FUTURA/OASIS 8): a randomized trial of intravenous unfractionated heparin during percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes initially treated with fondaparinux.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the optimal adjunctive unfractionated heparin (UFH) regimen for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) treated with fondaparinux. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety of 2 dose regimens of adjunctive intravenous UFH during PCI in high-risk patients with NSTE-ACS initially treated with fondaparinux and referred for early coronary angiography. DESIGN: This is an international prospective cohort study of approximately 4,000 high-risk patients presenting to hospital with unstable angina or non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, treated with fondaparinux as initial medical therapy, and referred for early coronary angiography with a view to revascularization. Within this cohort, 2,000 patients undergoing PCI will be eligible for enrollment into a double-blind international randomized parallel-group trial evaluating standard activated clotting time (ACT)-guided doses of intravenous UFH versus a non-ACT-guided weight-adjusted low dose. The standard regimen uses an 85-U/kg bolus of UFH if there is no platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GpIIb-IIIa) inhibitor or 60 U/kg if GpIIb-IIIa inhibitor use is planned, with additional bolus guided by blinded ACT measurements. The low-dose regimen uses a 50 U/kg UFH bolus, irrespective of planned GpIIb-IIIa use. The primary outcome is the composite of peri-PCI major bleeding, minor bleeding, or major vascular access site complications. The assessment of net clinical benefit is a key secondary outcome: it addresses the composite of peri-PCI major bleeding with death, myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization at day 30. CONCLUSION: FUTURA/OASIS 8 will help define the optimal UFH regimen as adjunct to PCI in high-risk NSTE-ACS patients treated with fondaparinux.",
