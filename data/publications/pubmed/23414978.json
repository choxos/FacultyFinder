  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Caregiver quality of life (QOL) is known to influence asthma management behaviors. Risk factors for low caregiver QOL in families of inner-city children with asthma remain unclear. This study evaluated the interrelationships of asthma control, stress, and caregiver QOL. METHOD: Data were analyzed from a home-based behavioral intervention for children with persistent asthma after treatment for asthma in the emergency department. Caregivers reported on baseline demographics, asthma control, asthma management stress, life stress, and QOL. Hierarchical regression analysis examined the contributions of sociodemographic factors, asthma control, asthma management stress, and life stress in explaining caregiver QOL. RESULTS: Children (N = 300) were primarily African American (96%) and young (mean age, 5.5 years). Caregivers were predominantly the biological mother (92%), single (70%), and unemployed (54%). Poor QOL was associated with higher caregiver education and number of children in the home, low asthma control, and increased asthma management stress and life stress. The model accounted for 28% of variance in caregiver QOL. DISCUSSION: Findings underscore the need for multifaceted interventions to provide tools to caregivers of children with asthma to help them cope with asthma management demands and contemporary life stressors.",
