  "title": "Exosomes derived from natural killer cells: transforming immunotherapy for aggressive breast cancer.",
  "abstract": "Natural killer cell-derived exosomes (NK-Exos) hold great promise as immune modulators and immunotherapeutics against cancer due to their intrinsically latent anti-tumor effects. They use these nanosized vesicles to deliver cytotoxic molecules, such as perforin, granzymes, and miRNAs, directly to cancer cells to kill them, avoiding immune suppression. NK-Exos has particular efficacy for treating aggressive breast cancer by modulating the TME to activate the immune response and suppress immunosuppressive factors. Bioengineering advances have extended the therapeutic potential of NK-Exos, which permits precise tumor cell targeting and efficient delivery of therapeutic payloads, including small RNAs and chemotherapeutic agents. In engineered NK-Exos, sensitization of cancer cells to apoptosis, reduction of tumor growth, and resistance to drugs have been demonstrated to be highly effective. When combined, NK-Exos synergizes with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or checkpoint inhibitors, enhancing therapeutic efficacy, and minimizing systemic toxicity. This review emphasizes the critical role of NK-Exos in breast cancer treatment, their integration into combination therapies, and the need for further research to overcome existing limitations and fully realize their clinical potential.",
