  "title": "Impact of serial measurements of tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion on mortality and morbidity after heart transplantation.",
  "abstract": "The impact of right ventricular (RV) dysfunction on long-term post-HTx outcomes remains uncertain. We assessed the impact of serial measurements of Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Excursion (TAPSE) on post-HTx mortality and morbidity. This two-center retrospective cohort study included consecutive adult HTx recipients (2000-2017). We used multivariable extended hazard regression models to evaluate the association between TAPSE and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), entered as time-dependent variables, and all-cause mortality, cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), acute cellular rejection (ACR), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). TAPSE was modelled using cubic splines. We included 485 HTx recipients (9461 TAPSE measurements), median (25th- 75th percentile) 19 (10-27) mm; median age was 52 (41-59) years, and 71.3% were male. During a follow-up of 6.7 (3.0-10.8) years, 92 patients died, 225 had ACR >2R, 234 CAV, and 91 CKD. By multivariable analysis, for each 1-mm decrease in patients with a TAPSE value <15mm, mortality increased by 22% (P<.001). For the average HTx recipient with a TAPSE of 15mm, 10mm, and 6mm, 1-year mortality was 3%, 7%, and 17%, and 5-year mortality was 8%, 20%, and 43%, respectively. Reduced TAPSE was significantly associated with increased CAV but notACR and CKD. A decrease in TAPSE below 15mm represents clinically significant graft dysfunction, warranting close monitoring.",
