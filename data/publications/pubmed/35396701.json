  "abstract": "AIM: To describe use of health services, unmet needs relating to health services, and identify factors associated with service use among adults with cerebral palsy (CP) in Ireland. METHOD: Data relating to demographics, secondary diagnoses, current use of health services and assistive devices, and unmet needs for both were obtained on adults with CP from the National Physical and Sensory Disability Database. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with service use. RESULTS: A total of 1268 adults with CP were included in this study. Over half were male (56%) and 78% lived with parents, siblings, or other family relatives. Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, and orthotics/prosthetic services were the most commonly used services, used by 57%, 48%, and 35% of the sample respectively. Unmet needs were highest for physiotherapy (23%) and occupational therapy services (13%). Age, sex, living arrangements, and wheelchair use were frequently associated with current service use. INTERPRETATION: Adults with CP used a wide range of health services and unmet needs were reported for all services. The findings highlight a need for planning and development of services to meet their needs, regardless of their age, mobility level, or living arrangements. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Adults with cerebral palsy (CP) in Ireland used a wide range of therapeutic, respite, personal assistance, and support services. Unmet needs were highest for physiotherapy and occupational therapy services. Adults aged 25â€‰years and above were less likely to use therapy services compared with younger adults. Adults living with parents, siblings, or family relatives were less likely to use personal assistance and physiotherapy services.",
