  "title": "Development of a Training to Address Needs of Sexual and Gender Minority Prostate Cancer Survivors: Results of Formative Research.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are limited training opportunities for healthcare professionals focused on the supportive care needs of sexual and gender minority (SGM) patients. SGM prostate cancer survivors have unique physical, psychosocial, and sexual needs that often go unaddressed due to lack of provider understanding of those needs. METHODS: To inform the development of a training and companion materials for healthcare professionals to fill this gap, the authors conducted formative research to assess the needs of target learners and SGM patients. Formative research included a survey and focus group of oncology social workers, and interviews with SGM prostate cancer survivors. RESULTS: Survey respondents indicated SGM patients deserved the same quality care as heterosexual, cisgender patients; however, one-third indicated they were not well informed regarding health needs of SGM people. Focus group themes included differing social support structures for SGM people and the need for healthcare professional training. Patient interviews indicated a need for SGM-specific training of healthcare professionals. CONCLUSION: There is a need for ongoing education and training among healthcare professionals to meet the needs of SGM prostate cancer survivors.",
