  "title": "Detection of anxiety symptoms and disorders in older adults: a diagnostic accuracy systematic review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety symptoms and disorders are common in older adults and often go undetected. A systematic review was completed to identify tools that can be used to detect anxiety symptoms and disorders in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO were searched using the search concepts anxiety, older adults and diagnostic accuracy in March 2023. Included articles assessed anxiety in community-dwelling older adults using an index anxiety tool and a gold standard form of anxiety assessment and reported resulting diagnostic accuracy outcomes. Estimates of pooled diagnostic accuracy outcomes were completed. RESULTS: Twenty-three anxiety tools were identified from the 32 included articles. Pooled diagnostic accuracy outcomes were estimated for the Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI)-20 [n = 3, sensitivity = 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.97, specificity = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.67-0.89] to detect generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and for the GAI-20 (n = 3, cut off ≥ 9, sensitivity = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.62-0.83, specificity = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.74-1.00), Beck Anxiety Inventory (n = 3, sensitivity = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.58-0.79, specificity = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.51-0.68) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-A) (n = 3, sensitivity = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.60-0.89, specificity = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.60-0.87) to detect anxiety disorders in clinical samples. CONCLUSION: The GAI-20 was the most studied tool and had adequate sensitivity while maintaining acceptable specificity when identifying GAD and anxiety disorders. The GAI-20, GAI-Short Form and HADS-A tools are supported for use in detecting anxiety in community-dwelling older adults. Brief, self-rated and easy-to-use tools may be the best options for anxiety detection in community-dwelling older adults given resource limitations. Clinicians may consider factors including patient comorbidities and anxiety prevalence when selecting a tool and cut off.",
