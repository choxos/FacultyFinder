  "title": "Magnetic resonance imaging of the elbow: update on current techniques and indications.",
  "abstract": "The utility of magnetic resonance imaging of the elbow has noticeably improved over the past decade. Advances in equipment and refinement of pulse sequences has allowed for superior visualization of many pathologic processes involving the elbow joint and its surrounding structures. At this time, magnetic resonance imaging is most valuable in detecting occult fractures, osteochondritis dissecans, collateral ligament tears, nonossified intra-articular loose bodies, and soft tissue masses. It may also aid in the diagnosis of tendinous injuries, compression neuropathies, and synovial disorders. This article serves as an educational update for hand surgeons and illustrates the features of normal anatomy and specific disorders of the elbow.",
