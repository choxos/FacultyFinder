  "title": "Evaluation of a diagnostic platelet aggregation test strategy for platelet rich plasma samples with low platelet counts.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Light transmission aggregometry (LTA) is important for diagnosing platelet function disorders (PFD) and von Willebrand disease (VWD) affecting ristocetin-induced platelet aggregation (RIPA). Nonetheless, data is lacking on the utility of LTA for investigating thrombocytopenic patients and platelet rich plasma samples with low platelet counts (L-PRP). Previously, we developed a strategy for diagnostic LTA assessment of L-PRP that included: (1) acceptance of referrals/samples, regardless of thrombocytopenia severity, (2) tailored agonist selection, based on which are informative for L-PRP with mildly or severely low platelet counts, and (3) interpretation of maximal aggregation (MA) using regression-derived 95% confidence intervals, determined for diluted control L-PRP (C-L-PRP). METHODS: To further evaluate the L-PRP LTA strategy, we evaluated findings for a subsequent patient cohort. RESULTS: Between 2008 and 2021, the L-PRP strategy was applied to 211 samples (11.7% of all LTA samples) from 192 unique patients, whose platelet counts (median [range] × 10[9] /L) for blood and L-PRP were: 105 [13-282; 89% with thrombocytopenia] and 164 [17-249], respectively. Patient-L-PRP had more abnormal MA findings than simultaneously tested C-L-PRP (p-values <0.001). Among patients with accessible electronic medical records (n = 181), L-PRP LTA uncovered significant aggregation abnormalities in 45 (24.9%), including 18/30 (60%) with <80 × 10[9]  platelets/L L-PRP, and ruled out PFD, and VWD affecting RIPA, in others. The L-PRP LTA strategy helped diagnose VWD affecting RIPA, Bernard Soulier syndrome, familial platelet disorder with myeloid malignancy, suspected ITGA2B/ITGB3-related thrombocytopenia, and acquired PFD. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic LTA with L-PRP, using a strategy that considers thrombocytopenia severity, is feasible and informative.",
