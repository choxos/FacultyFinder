  "title": "Managing obesity in children: a clinical practice guideline.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is a complex, chronic, stigmatized disease whereby abnormal or excess body fat may impair health or increase the risk of medical complications, and can reduce quality of life and shorten lifespan in children and families. We developed this guideline to provide evidence-based recommendations on options for managing pediatric obesity that support shared decision-making among children living with obesity, their families, and their health care providers. METHODS: We followed the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We used the Guidelines International Network principles to manage competing interests. Caregivers, health care providers, and people living with obesity participated throughout the guideline development process, which optimized relevance. We surveyed end users (caregivers, health care providers) to prioritize health outcomes, completed 3 scoping reviews (2 on minimal important difference estimates; 1 on clinical assessment), performed 1 systematic review to characterize families' values and preferences, and conducted 3 systematic reviews and meta-analyses to examine the benefits and harms of behavioural and psychological, pharmacologic, and surgical interventions for managing obesity in children. Guideline panellists developed recommendations focused on an individualized approach to care by using the GRADE evidence-to-decision framework, incorporating values and preferences of children living with obesity and their caregivers. RECOMMENDATIONS: Our guideline includes 10 recommendations and 9 good practice statements for managing obesity in children. Managing pediatric obesity should be guided by a comprehensive child and family assessment based on our good practice statements. Behavioural and psychological interventions, particularly multicomponent interventions (strong recommendation, very low to moderate certainty), should form the foundation of care, with tailored therapy and support using shared decision-making based on the potential benefits, harms, certainty of evidence, and values and preferences of children and families. Pharmacologic and surgical interventions should be considered (conditional recommendation, low to moderate certainty) as therapeutic options based on availability, feasibility, and acceptability, and guided by shared decision-making between health care providers and families. INTERPRETATION: This guideline will support children, families, and health care providers to have informed discussions about the balance of benefits and harms for available obesity management interventions to support value- and preference-sensitive decision-making.",
