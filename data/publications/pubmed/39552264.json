  "title": "Treatment of Critical Bleeds in Patients With Immune Thrombocytopenia: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Evidence-based protocols for managing bleeding emergencies in patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are lacking. We conducted a systematic review of treatments for critical bleeding in patients with ITP. METHODS: We included all study designs and extracted data in aggregate or individually for patients who received one or more interventions and for whom any of the following outcomes were reported: platelet count response, bleeding, disability, or death. RESULTS: We identified 49 eligible studies reporting 112 critical bleed patients with ITP, including 66 children (median age, 10 years), 36 adults (median age, 41.5 years), and 10 patients with unreported age. Patients received corticosteroids (n = 67), IVIG (n = 49), platelet transfusions (n = 41), TPO-RAs (n = 17), and splenectomy (n = 28) either alone or in combination. Studies reported 29 different treatment combinations, the 5 most common were corticosteroids, platelet transfusion and splenectomy (n = 13), corticosteroids and IVIG (n = 13), or splenectomy alone (n = 13); IVIG alone (n = 11); and corticosteroids, IVIG and TPO-RA (n = 8). Mortality among patients with critical bleeds in ITP was 30.6% for adults and 19.7% for children. CONCLUSIONS: The effects of individual treatments on patient outcomes were uncertain due to very low-quality evidence. There is a need for a standardized approach to the treatment of ITP critical bleeds. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: CRD42020161206.",
