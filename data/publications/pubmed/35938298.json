  "title": "It is time for a national strategy on equitable access to assistive technology in Canada.",
  "abstract": "The time has come to develop and implement a Canadian strategy on equitable access to Assistive Technology (AT). AT use has significant health, social, and economic benefits for people with disabilities and older people, and benefits society by assisting to mitigate the most prominent health and social challenges of our time. Our research with citizens (with/without experiences of disabilities or AT use) and system leaders across Canada determined that access is variable and inequitable, with unmet needs, restricted funding, and inefficiencies. Collaboratively, we devised a blueprint, comprising a policy vision, three priority issues to address, principles to underpin policy actions, and short- and long-term priorities, from which to build a strategy. We hope the blueprint sparks action among citizens and health leaders, especially those working across governments, sectors, and communities to promote leadership and create a cross-jurisdictional coalition to elaborate on a national strategy and action plans for moving forward.",
