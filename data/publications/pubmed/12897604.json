  "title": "Designing, conducting, and evaluating journal clubs in orthopaedic surgery.",
  "abstract": "The first record of a journal club was that founded in 1875 by Sir William Osler at McGill University for the purchase and distribution of periodicals to which he could not afford to subscribe as an individual. Evidence-based medicine is becoming an accepted educational paradigm in medical education at various levels. An analysis of the literature related to journal clubs in residency programs in specialties other than orthopaedic surgery reveals that the three most common goals were to teach critical appraisal skills (67%), to have an impact on clinical practice (59%), and to keep up with the current literature (56%). The implementation of the structured article review checklist has been found to increase resident satisfaction and improves the perceived educational value of the journal club without increasing resident workload or decreasing attendance at the conference. Periodic evaluation of the conference and the institution of appropriate changes ensures that the journal club remains a valuable and successful part of the training program.",
