  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Psychosocial screening is a standard of care in pediatric oncology, but there is limited information about how to intervene after screening. This pilot trial aimed to determine feasibility of the novel Enhanced Psychosocial Screening Intervention (EPSI) and explore its preliminary efficacy outcomes. We examined rates of recruitment, retention, intervention acceptability, and monthly distress screening completion, as well as exploratory efficacy outcomes (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System: depression, anxiety and fatigue; distress thermometer, pain and sleep). METHODS: Parallel-group randomized pilot trial: Caregiver-youth (10-17 years at enrollment, newly diagnosed with cancer) dyads were randomly allocated to either EPSI or standard care with 1:1 ratio allocation. EPSI consists of having a Psychosocial Navigator who shares screening results conducted near diagnosis and monthly for one year with treating teams and families, and provides recommendations tailored to screening results. RESULTS: Enrollment rate was 54% (38 dyads); retention was 90% and acceptability 86% (caregivers) and 76% (youth). Exploratory symptoms of depression, anxiety, distress and fatigue outcomes consistently improved mainly for caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest EPSI is feasible and acceptable and exploratory mental and physical efficacy outcomes are promising for use in a future confirmatory multisite efficacy trial.",
