  "title": "Clinical research methods for treatment, diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, screening, and prevention: A narrative review.",
  "abstract": "This narrative review is an introduction for health professionals on how to conduct and report clinical research on six categories: treatment, diagnosis/differential diagnosis, prognosis, etiology, screening, and prevention. The importance of beginning with an appropriate clinical question and the exploration of how appropriate it is through a literature search are explained. There are three methodological directives that can assist clinicians in conducting their studies from a methodological perspective: (1) how to conduct an original study or a systematic review, (2) how to report an original study or a systematic review, and (3) how to assess the quality or risk of bias for a previous relevant original study or systematic review. This methodological overview article would provide readers with the key points and resources regarding how to perform high-quality research on the six main clinical categories.",
