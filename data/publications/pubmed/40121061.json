  "title": "AGA Living Clinical Practice Guideline on Computer-Aided Detection-Assisted Colonoscopy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: This American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) guideline is intended to provide an overview of the evidence and support endoscopists and patients on the use of computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for the detection of colorectal polyps during colonoscopy. METHODS: A multidisciplinary panel of content experts and guideline methodologists used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework and relied on the following sources of evidence: (1) a systematic review examining the desirable and undesirable effects (ie, benefits and harms) of CADe-assisted colonoscopy, (2) a microsimulation study estimating the effects of CADe on longer-term patient-important outcomes, (3) a systematic search of evidence evaluating the values and preferences of patients undergoing colonoscopy, and (4) a systematic review of studies evaluating health care providers' trust in artificial intelligence technology in gastroenterology. RESULTS: The panel reached the conclusion that no recommendation could be made for or against the use of CADe-assisted colonoscopy in light of very low certainty of evidence for the critical outcomes, desirable and undesirable (11 fewer colorectal cancers per 10,000 individuals and 2 fewer colorectal cancer deaths per 10,000 individuals), increased burden of more intensive surveillance colonoscopies (635 more per 10,000 individuals), and cost and resource implications. The panel acknowledged the 8% (95% CI, 6%-10%) increase in adenoma detection rate and 2% (95% CI, 0%-4%) increase in advanced adenoma and/or sessile serrated lesion detection rate. CONCLUSIONS: This guideline highlights the close tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects and the limitations in the current evidence to support a recommendation. The panel acknowledged the potential for CADe to continually improve as an iterative artificial intelligence application. Ongoing publications providing evidence for critical outcomes will help inform a future recommendation.",
