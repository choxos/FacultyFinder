  "title": "Moving the dial on diagnostics: an update from the Lancet Commission on diagnostics.",
  "abstract": "The Lancet Commission on diagnostics made recommendations for ten topics: national strategy (including national essential diagnostics lists), access in primary care, workforce, regulatory framework, national financing, affordability, appropriate use of technology, needs in conflict or fragile situations, advocacy, and an international alliance with oversight capabilities. Since 2021, progress in these areas has benefitted greatly from the adoption of a World Health Assembly resolution on diagnostics and the work of a broad coalition, as assessed by literature surveys by subject matter experts, quantitative findings (where feasible), and an anonymous survey of knowledgeable and engaged individuals. Greater progress was observed where there was political will and the production of diagnostics coincided with industrial policy goals, also in areas where changing the legal and health policy frameworks was involved. Progress was slower on recommendations with substantial resource implications (eg, labour force, affordability, and diagnostics for conflict situations). It is expected that the Global Diagnostics Coalition will consolidate and accelerate progress.",
