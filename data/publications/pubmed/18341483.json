  "title": "Gastric Cancer Consensus conference recommends Helicobacter pylori screening and treatment in asymptomatic persons from high-risk populations to prevent gastric cancer.",
  "abstract": "Gastric adenocarcinoma remains a common cause of death worldwide, and there is convincing evidence that this cancer is causally linked to Helicobacter pylori. The first Asian-Pacific Gastric Cancer Consensus brought together leading authorities in the field including the authors, and systematically reviewed all of the available evidence for the role of H. pylori, diet and other risk factors in this malignancy. The consensus conference boldly recommended population-based screening and treatment for H. pylori in particularly high-risk population settings. The evidence for these recommendations is summarized in this report, and the global and U.S. implications are considered.",
