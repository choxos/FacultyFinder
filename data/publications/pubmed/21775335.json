  "title": "The burden of osteoporotic fractures beyond acute care: the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos).",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: the burden associated with osteoporotic fractures has commonly been reported in terms of utilisation of acute care. However, individuals with fractures suffer lasting deficits in quality of life and the burden of care extends well beyond the initial acute care period. The burden of fractures related to post-acute heath care utilisation, and informal care giving, has not been sufficiently addressed. We examine the use of formal and informal post-acute care in men and women 50 years and older who sustained fractures. METHODS: the study sample consisted of 1,116 men and women from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos) who sustained a fracture. We assessed utilisation of post-acute care including rehabilitative and home care services, as well as informal care in persons with a hip, vertebral, or non-hip-non-vertebral fractures. RESULTS: use of rehabilitative and home care services was reported by 37.1% and 18.2% of men and women, respectively. Persons with hip fracture were more likely to report use of these services compared with persons with non-hip-non-vertebral fractures; those with vertebral fracture were less likely to report using these services. Use of informal care was reported by 47.2% of participants. Individuals with multiple fractures made more extensive use of post-acute resources compared with those with single fractures. CONCLUSIONS: use of post-acute care in individuals with fracture is extensive and the contribution of use of these resources to the overall burden of fractures cannot be ignored. Our findings have implications for future economic analyses and policy-making related to care of osteoporotic fractures.",
