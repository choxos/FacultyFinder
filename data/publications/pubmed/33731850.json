  "title": "Pediatric MDS and bone marrow failure-associated germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L impair multiple pathways in primary hematopoietic cells.",
  "abstract": "Pediatric myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous disease group associated with impaired hematopoiesis, bone marrow hypocellularity, and frequently have deletions involving chromosome 7 (monosomy 7). We and others recently identified heterozygous germline mutations in SAMD9 and SAMD9L in children with monosomy 7 and MDS. We previously demonstrated an antiproliferative effect of these gene products in non-hematopoietic cells, which was exacerbated by their patient-associated mutations. Here, we used a lentiviral overexpression approach to assess the functional impact and underlying cellular processes of wild-type and mutant SAMD9 or SAMD9L in primary mouse or human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). Using a combination of protein interactome analyses, transcriptional profiling, and functional validation, we show that SAMD9 and SAMD9L are multifunctional proteins that cause profound alterations in cell cycle, cell proliferation, and protein translation in HSPCs. Importantly, our molecular and functional studies also demonstrated that expression of these genes and their mutations leads to a cellular environment that promotes DNA damage repair defects and ultimately apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. This study provides novel functional insights into SAMD9 and SAMD9L and how their mutations can potentially alter hematopoietic function and lead to bone marrow hypocellularity, a hallmark of pediatric MDS.",
