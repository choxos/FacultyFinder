  "abstract": "Different models may be used for explaining how research-based evidence is used in healthcare system policy-making. It is argued that models arising from a clinical setting (i.e. evidence-based policy-making model) could be useful regarding some types of healthcare system decision-making. However, such models are \"silent\" concerning the influence of political contextual factors on healthcare policy-making and are thus inconsistent with decision-making regarding the modification of healthcare system arrangements. Other political science-based models would seem to be more useful for understanding that research is just one factor affecting decision-making and that different types of research-based evidence can be used instrumentally, conceptual or strategically during different policy-making stages.",
