  "title": "The importance of obstetric and gynaecologic sonographer health and safety.",
  "abstract": "In the field of obstetrics and gynaecology, sonographers are often exposed to health and safety risks that may have significant consequences: it has been reported that up to 90% of sonographers experience work-related musculoskeletal disorders. These have the potential to be career-ending. This topic warrants routine evaluation, which is the aim of this editorial. We intend to achieve this by presenting a summary of risks, their outcomes, and strategies to optimise health and wellness in the workplace of sonographers in obstetrics and gynaecology. We believe this discussion is of utmost importance to sonographers, their employers, and regulatory bodies.",
