  "title": "Cognitive dysfunction in hip fracture patients.",
  "abstract": "Hip fractures represent a widespread morbidity among the geriatric population. In North America, more than 320,000 hip fractures are sustained annually, a number that is expected to increase dramatically as the population continues to age. Disorders of cognition, primarily dementia and delirium, also have a higher-than-average incidence and prevalence among the geriatric population. The co-occurrence of cognitive dysfunction and hip fracture is an important entity for orthopedic surgeons and other clinicians involved in hip fracture care to recognize. This article provides an overview of the currently available evidence regarding cognitive dysfunction, specifically dementia and delirium, in patients with hip fractures.",
