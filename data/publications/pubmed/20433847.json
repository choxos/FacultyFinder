  "title": "The slug parasitic nematode Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita associates with complex and variable bacterial assemblages that do not affect its virulence.",
  "abstract": "Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita is a nematode parasite of slugs that is commercially reared in monoxenic culture with the bacterium Moraxella osloensis and sold as a biological molluscicide. However, its bacterial associations when reared in vivo in slugs are unknown. We show that when reared in vivo in slugs, P. hermaphrodita does not retain M. osloensis and associates with complex and variable bacterial assemblages that do not influence its virulence. This is in marked contrast to the entomopathogenic nematodes that form highly specific mutualistic associations with Enterobacteriaceae that are specifically retained during in vivo growth.",
