  "title": "Facility-Based Maternal Quality of Care Frameworks: A Systematic Review and Best Fit Framework Analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The World Health Organization has adopted two main strategies to improve the quality of maternal health: increasing the number of deliveries by skilled birth attendants and increasing access to emergency obstetric care. Despite increased access to care, there continue to be high rates of maternal morbidity and mortality in part due to quality of care. This study aims to identify and summarize existing frameworks for measuring quality of maternal care at a facility-level. METHODS: PubMed, Health Systems Evidence, Embase, Global Health, OVID Healthstar, OVID Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were searched for frameworks, tools, theories, or components of frameworks relevant to maternal quality of care in facility-level settings. Title/abstract and full-text screening were completed by two independent reviewers and conflicts resolved through consensus or a third reviewer. RESULTS: An initial search resulted in 3182 studies. Fifty-four studies were included in the qualitative analysis. A best fit framework analysis was done using the updated Hulton framework as the conceptual framework. A facility-based maternal quality of care framework is proposed including the following components, separated into provision and experience of care: (1) human resources; (2) infrastructure; (3) equipment, supplies and medicine; (4) evidence and information; (5) referral and networks of care; (6) cultural competence; (7) clinical practice; (8) financing; (9) leadership and governance; (10) cognition; and 11) respect, dignity, equity, and emotional support.",
