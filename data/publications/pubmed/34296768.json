  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There has been a continuing trend toward decreasing the length of hospital stay for patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). We aimed to investigate the impact of timing of discharge on gait and patient-reported outcomes early after THA. METHODS: In this prospective observational cohort study conducted from May 2014 to November 2015, we measured gait velocity, stride length, single-limb support and single-limb support symmetry in adults aged 18-75 years before direct anterior THA, at discharge from the hospital, and 2, 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively. All procedures were performed by a single surgeon. Patients were discharged on the same day as surgery (outpatient group) or stayed at least 1 night in hospital (inpatient group). Participants also completed the Timed Up and Go test (all postoperative time points) and a series of questionnaires (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index [6 and 12 wk], 12-Item Short Form Health Survey [2, 6 and 12 wk], Harris Hip Score [12 wk] and a pain visual analogue scale [all postoperative time points]). RESULTS: Thirty-six participants were enrolled in the study, of whom 16 were outpatients and 20 were inpatients. The mean pain rating at the time of discharge was lower in the outpatient group than in the inpatient group (adjusted mean difference -1.5, 95% confidence interval -3.0 to 0.0). We found no other significant differences between the groups for any gait, patient-reported or surgical outcome. CONCLUSION: There were no statistically significant differences in gait or patient-reported outcomes after direct anterior THA between patients who stayed overnight and those who were discharged as outpatients. Patients discharged as outpatients were younger than those who stayed overnight. Our results suggest that discharging patients as an outpatient after direct anterior THA may have a similar impact on patient function and outcomes as a standard overnight stay in hospital.",
