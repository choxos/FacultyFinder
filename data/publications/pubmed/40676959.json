  "abstract": "AIM: This research aimed to explore the perspectives of primary and community care providers on the challenges that hinder the delivery and uptake of personalized type 2 diabetes (T2D) care, with a focus on the integration of mental health support and care. BACKGROUND: The day-to-day burden and demand of self-managing T2D can negatively impact quality of life and take a toll on mental health and psychological well-being. As a result, there is a need for personalized T2D self-management education and support that integrates mental health care. Despite the need for this personalized care, existing systems remain siloed, hindering access and uptake. In response, innovative, comprehensive, and collaborative models of care have been developed to address fragmentations in care. As individuals living with T2D often receive their care in primary care settings, linking mental health care to existing teams and networks in primary care settings is required. However, there is a need to understand how best to support access, adoption, and engagement with these models in these unique contexts. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to primary and community providers of an Ontario-based smoking cessation network. Survey data were analyzed descriptively with free text responses thematically reported. FINDINGS: Survey respondents (n = 85) represented a broad mix of health professions across primary and community care settings. Addressing challenges to the delivery and uptake of personalized T2D care requires comprehensive strategies to address patient-, practice-, and system-level challenges. Findings from this survey identify the need to tailor these models of care to individual needs, clearly addressing mental health needs, and building strong partnership as means of enhancing accessibility and sustainability of integrated care delivery in primary care settings.",
