  "title": "Hypertension Attitude PersPEctives and Needs (HAPPEN): A Real-World Survey of Physicians and Patients With Hypertension in China.",
  "abstract": "The Hypertension Attitude PersPEctives and Needs (HAPPEN) survey was a real-world survey of cardiologists, nephrologists, and patients with treated hypertension at level 3 hospitals in China. It aimed to characterize the attitudes and behavior of physicians and patients and to identify possible causes of poor blood pressure (BP) control. Randomly selected participants (100 cardiologists, 30 nephrologists, 400 patients) completed face-to-face interviews investigating BP control rates, consulting behavior, prescribing patterns, and attitudes toward hypertension management. Perceived levels of BP control were high; 70% of physicians and 85% of patients believed that BP targets were achieved, despite only 31% of patients achieving targets. Physician satisfaction with control rates and patient satisfaction with treatment were high. Differences in perceived and actual levels of BP control may be driving therapeutic inertia. In combination with inadequate patient evaluation and support services, therapeutic inertia may contribute to poor BP control among patients with treated hypertension in China.",
