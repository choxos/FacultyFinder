  "abstract": "The polyuria and polydipsia state in diabetes insipidus (DI) can be challenging to manage for patients and clinicians with significant impact on the patients' well-being. A review of literature shows that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), thiazide and potassium-sparing diuretics, along with low dietary solute and protein, and high water intake remain the standard medical therapy. Although these therapeutic approaches improve symptoms, the urine-concentrating defect is still considerable, posing a serious risk to patient's life from hypovolemia if high fluid intake is not maintained. Our case describes the challenges faced with the medical management of a patient with nephrogenic DI that was only partially responsive to standard medical therapy, resulting in debilitating effects on the patient's quality of life.",
