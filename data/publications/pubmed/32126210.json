  "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an emerging neglected tropical disease in Azad Jammu and Kashmir which is an underdeveloped area. Prevalence and parasite species identification are the key factors to control disease in a particular population, which were the objectives of the present study. Due to a lack of previous data, we performed a district-based active CL surveillance in 2018. The data of CL, suspected (n = 20,000) cases were analyzed statistically and identified the parasite species in microscopic positive cases by ITS1-PCR RFLP and also obtained accession numbers MN891719-28 from gene Bank. The phylogenetic tree was constructed using MEGA6 software. Out of 20,000 CL, suspected cases the highest rate of 4.02% (135/3360) of CL in Mirpur and the lowest 1.58% (8/505) in Neelum was reported. The slide positivity rate, annual parasite incidence rate and annual blood examination rate were 2.27 per 1000 population, 0.08 and 0.34%. The males were more infected 58.12% (297/511) than females 41.88% (214/511) and the age group of 1-20 years were found highly infected 82.78% (423/511) than 21-40 years 13.89% (71/511) and 41-60 years 3.33% (17/511) in the studied population. The patients 56.36% (288/511) had a single lesion whereas 29.35% (150/511) had two, only 10.76% (31/288) and 8% (12/150) were using bed nets. The patients 14.29% (73/511) had three or more lesions were not using bed nets. Only 27.98% (143/511) patients had received treatment, while 72.02% (368/511) didn't. Microscopically positive cases were found to be 2.56% (511/20,000) and ITS1-PCR positive cases were found to be 91.39% (467/511). The RFLP assay confirmed the presence of Leishmania tropica in 467 samples.",
