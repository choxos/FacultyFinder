  "title": "Linguistic validation of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire in an Arabic-speaking population with chronic respiratory diseases.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop an Arabic version of the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) to be known as ArabiCRQ. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a linguistic validation of the CRQ in the Arabic language. The validation process involved 4 phases, including forward and backward translations, pilot testing, and revision to produce a final version of the ArabiCRQ. Five native Arabic-speaking patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease completed the ArabiCRQ both in initial and follow-up visits. Wording was modified according to feedback the participants provided. RESULTS: Two of the patients' scores changed appreciably, despite ensuring their clinical stability. CONCLUSION: The ArabiCRQ may be a valuable tool to assess the health-related quality of life in patients with chronic respiratory diseases.",
