  "title": "Feasibility of studying the association between intraoperative regional cerebral oxygen saturation and postoperative functional decline (ReFUNCTION): a pilot sub-study of NeuroVISION-Cardiac Surgery.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Function describes an individual's ability to perform everyday activities. In the context of cardiac surgery, functional changes quantify the effect of surgery on one's day-to-day life. Decreases in regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been associated with postoperative cognitive decline but its relationship with function has not been studied. We sought to determine the feasibility of conducting a large observational study examining the relationship between decreases in rScO2 during cardiac surgery and postoperative functional decline. METHODS: We undertook a single-centre, pilot sub-study of the NeuroVISION-Cardiac Surgery pilot study, which included adults undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting on cardiopulmonary bypass; all patients enrolled in NeuroVISION-Cardiac Surgery were included. Function was evaluated at baseline, 30 days, and three months using the Standardized Assessment of Global activities in the Elderly (SAGE) scale. Blinded NIRS monitors were affixed for the duration of surgery. Our feasibility outcomes were to recruit one patient per week, obtain complete NIRS data in ≥ 90%, obtain SAGE at all time-points in ≥ 90%, and determine the time required for NIRS data to be transcribed into case report forms. RESULTS: 49/50 patients enrolled in NeuroVISION-Cardiac Surgery were recruited over 48 weeks (1.02 patients/week). Of the 49 included patients, 49 (100%) had complete NIRS data and 44 (90%) had complete SAGE data. The time required for NIRS data collection was a mean (standard deviation) of 5.5 (1.8) min per patient. CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows the feasibility of conducting a large observational study examining the relationship between decreases in cerebral saturation during cardiac surgery and postoperative functional decline.
