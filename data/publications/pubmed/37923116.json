  "title": "The Role of Preoperative Opioid Use in Foot and Ankle Surgery: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "Prescription opioids, particularly for treating musculoskeletal pain, are a significant contributor to the opioid epidemic in North America. There is also evidence to suggest that chronic use of opioids is associated with poor outcomes after orthopedic surgery. However, whether this association is relevant in foot and ankle surgery is still unclear. Accordingly, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken to assess the impact of preoperative opioid use in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgery concerning postoperative pain, complications, and postoperative opioid dependence. Four databases, including EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and CINAHL, were searched to March 2022 for studies reporting preoperative opioid use and its effect on postoperative outcomes or opioid use after foot and ankle surgery. A total of 22,092 patients were included in the final synthesis of 8 studies. Most of which were level 3 evidence (5 studies). Around 18% of the patients used opioids preoperatively. Preoperative opioid use was associated with more quantities and prolonged use of opioids postoperatively. Two studies showed an increased risk of complications postoperatively in patients who used opioids preoperatively compared to the nonopioid group. Preoperative opioid use in patients undergoing foot and ankle surgeries is associated with increased and prolonged use of opioids postoperatively and may therefore predict the potential for misuse.",
