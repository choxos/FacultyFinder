  "abstract": "Manual delineation of liver segments on computed tomography (CT) images for primary/secondary liver cancer (LC) patients is time-intensive and prone to inter/intra-observer variability. Therefore, we developed a deep-learning-based model to auto-contour liver segments and spleen on contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) images. We trained two models using 3d patch-based attention U-Net ([Formula: see text] and 3d full resolution of nnU-Net ([Formula: see text] to determine the best architecture ([Formula: see text]. BA was used with vessels ([Formula: see text] and spleen ([Formula: see text] to assess the impact on segment contouring. Models were trained, validated, and tested on 160 ([Formula: see text]), 40 ([Formula: see text]), 33 ([Formula: see text]), 25 (CCH) and 20 (CPVE) CECT of LC patients. [Formula: see text] outperformed [Formula: see text] across all segments with median differences in Dice similarity coefficients (DSC) ranging 0.03-0.05 (p < 0.05). [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] were not statistically different (p > 0.05), however, both were slightly better than [Formula: see text] by DSC up to 0.02. The final model, [Formula: see text], showed a mean DSC of 0.89, 0.82, 0.88, 0.87, 0.96, and 0.95 for segments 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-8, and spleen, respectively on entire test sets. Qualitatively, more than 85% of cases showed a Likert score [Formula: see text] 3 on test sets. Our final model provides clinically acceptable contours of liver segments and spleen which are usable in treatment planning.",
