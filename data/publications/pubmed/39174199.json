  "abstract": "Identifying people at risk for progressive chronic kidney disease and connecting them with recommended care is crucial for providing timely and optimal treatment. The ASSIST-CKD (A programme to Spread eGFR [estimated glomerular filtration rate] graph Surveillance for the early identification, Support and Treatment of people with progressive CKD [chronic kidney disease]) trial evaluated the effect of graphical eGFR reporting to primary care physicians on late presentation to a nephrologist in the United Kingdom. Trial data were obtained from the UK Renal Registry. Although the results were neutral, the data generated from the ASSIST-CKD trial are informative and provide useful estimates of the intervention effect. The trial also provides valuable insights into the challenges of implementing complex interventions in busy health care environments, which can be used to guide the designs of future interventions.",
