  "abstract": "Co-occurring autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have been associated with poorer social skills. Most studies examining the association of ADHD symptoms and social skills in autism employ categorical and cross-sectional designs, which provide a narrow view of the development of ADHD symptoms. Using group-based trajectory modeling, we identified five trajectories of caregiver-reported attention problems in an inception cohort of autistic children (N = 393) followed from age 2-5 years (T1) to age 10.5-11 years (T8): Low-Stable (LS; 15.5% of participants), Low-Decreasing (LD; 25.2%), Low-Increasing (LI; 19.2%), Moderate-Decreasing (MD; 32.9%), and High-Stable (HS; 7.2%). Child FSIQ and caregiver age at baseline were lower and caregiver depression at baseline was higher for participants in the MD group than the LS group. Psychotropic medication use was associated with higher attention problems. The MD and HS groups had similar mean Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales, Second Edition (VABS-II) Socialization standard scores at T8, which were lower than other groups. The LI group had lower Socialization scores than the LS group. Results support that a decline in caregiver-reported attention problems is common but not universal in autistic children and that even moderate/subclinical attention problems may relate to social skills outcomes in autism.",
