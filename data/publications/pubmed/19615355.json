  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To review pediatric critical values after consultation with departmental pediatricians. METHODS: An electronic survey with the critical value list of 26 high or low abnormal chemistry laboratory values of 12 analytes was circulated to pediatricians. The survey results were presented to a focus group of 3 pediatricians for comments and review. RESULTS: Thirty-one of 125 pediatricians affiliated with the Department of Pediatrics responded. Sixteen of 26 (61.5%) current values met the agreement criteria. The procedures for calling high glucose levels in neonates and children, and the low magnesium and low ionized calcium critical values were revised after discussion with the focus group. CONCLUSIONS: This survey among the hospital's pediatricians resulted not only in a revised list of critical values, but also the procedure for calling the user. The use of unique critical values for different areas of clinical practice within the children's hospital was identified as an area for future development.",
