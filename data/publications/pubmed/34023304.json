  "abstract": "The genetic diversity of Leishmania spp. in North Eastern Pakistan remains undetermined despite increased cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). This study was designed to decipher the molecular characterization and genetic diversity of Leishmania spp. in North Eastern Pakistan. Out of 13761 CL suspected cases, 567 cases were microscopically positive and confirmed as Leishmania spp. by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene amplification through the PCR- RFLP technique. Further, isolates were directly sequenced to conduct phylogenetic analysis for genetic diversity. Among suspected CL cases, Mirpur showed the highest proportion of CL infection with 4.85% (118/2431) of the cases, while the Neelum district showed the lowest percentage at 3.29% (9/273). The slide positivity rate, annual blood examination rate, and annual parasite incidence rate were 3.84, 0.27, and 0.01% respectively, and the incidence of CL in the age group 1-20 years old was higher in males (50.92%) than females (25.75%). The RFLP analysis and sequencing confirmed the occurrence of Leishmania tropica, Leishmania major, and Leishmania infantum. Leishmania tropica (p = 0.02) confirmed significantly higher nucleotides variation than L. major (p = 0.05). Current findings confirmed the prior assumption that anthroponotic CL is the primary CL form present in North Eastern Pakistan. Moreover, this is the first report based on molecular identification of L. major, and L. infantum from North Eastern Pakistan. This remarkable heterogeneity in the Leishmania spp. is the leading cause of treatment failure and emergence of new haplotypes. Therefore more extensive investigations are recommended from all geographical regions of North Eastern Pakistan, especially those using a large sample size.",
