  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To summarize the literature on pharmacotherapy for managing paediatric obesity. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with <18-year-olds of pharmacotherapeutic agents published up to November 2022. Estimates of effect for outcomes were presented relative to minimal important differences and GRADE certainty of evidence. We examined data on patient/proxy-reported outcome measures (PROMs), cardiometabolic risk factors, anthropometry and adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Overall, 35 RCTs were included. Trials examined metformin (n = 26), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) (n = 7) and a lipase inhibitor (orlistat; n = 2). Intervention duration varied (3-24 months). Metformin had little to no benefit on PROMs (e.g., health-related quality of life [HRQoL]; 6 RCTs), moderate reductions in triglycerides, a moderate decline in insulin resistance, a small to moderate decline in BMI z-score (BMIz) and a moderate increase in mild to moderate gastrointestinal AEs. Response to GLP1RAs was heterogeneous and results of subgroup analysis demonstrated variability of impact. Liraglutide (2 RCTs) resulted in a small reduction in HOMA-IR and BMIz, but little to no benefit on other outcomes. Exenatide (4 RCTs) had a moderate reduction on blood pressure and a small decrease in BMIz with little to no benefit on other outcomes. Semaglutide (1 RCT) had a small benefit on HRQoL, a small reduction on SBP, a moderate reduction on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, a large reduction on triglyceride, and a very large decline in BMIz accompanied by a small increase in mild to moderate gastrointestinal AEs. Orlistat had a moderate reduction in DBP and little to no benefit in other outcomes measured, but had a very large increased risk of mild to moderate gastrointestinal AEs. Serious AEs were rare and for interventions with sufficent AE reporting, were considered not likely attributable to the interventions. CONCLUSION: Few studies examined the impact of pharmacotherapy on PROMs. There is evidence that metformin and GLP1RAs lead to important improvements in cardiometabolic and anthropometric outcomes while accompanied by mild to moderate AEs. Long-term effectiveness and safety of GLP1RAs remain to be evaluated.",
