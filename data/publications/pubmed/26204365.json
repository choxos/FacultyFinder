  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study describes our experience with the placement of a skin-level gastrostomy device (MIC-KEY) in a single procedure. METHODS: We identified infants, children and young adults who underwent laparoscopic-assisted percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (LAPEG) tube insertion between October 2009 and June 2013. The steps of this procedure include upper endoscopy, single-port laparoscopy, gastropexy via percutaneous T-fasteners and placement of a skin-level gastrostomy device (MIC-KEY) using a \"push\" technique with a tear-away sheath. RESULTS: We included 92 patients in our study. Mean age was 3.7 years (range 3 wk-5 yr), and mean weight was 11.2 (range 2.8-54) kg. Median procedural time was 20 (range 12-76) minutes. Total median duration for the most recent 25 procedures was lower than that of the first 25 (62 v. 79 min, p = 0.004). There were no intraoperative complications or conversions to open surgery. Postoperative complications were observed in 6 (6.5%) patients. Three retained T-fasteners were assessed endoscopically (n = 1) or removed via local excision (n = 2). Two patients experienced early dislodged feeding tubes that were replaced via interventional radiology (n = 1) or repeat LAPEG (n = 1). There was also 1 intra-abdominal fluid collection that was drained percutaneously but ultimately required a laparotomy and washout. There were no major complications in the most recent 50 procedures. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that LAPEG is a safe, minimally invasive procedure for infants, children and young adults. This approach allows for immediate use of a skin-level gastrostomy device without the need for postoperative tube exchanges.",
