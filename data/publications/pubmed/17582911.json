  "abstract": "This paper reports the proceedings of a consensus meeting on the incidence and complications of multiple gestation in Canada. In addition to background presentations about current and possible future practice in Canada, the expert panel also developed a set of consensus points. The need for infertility to be understood, and funded, as a healthcare problem was emphasized, along with recognition of the emotional impact of infertility. It was agreed that the goal of assisted reproduction treatment is the delivery of a single healthy infant and that even though many positive outcomes have resulted from twin or even triplet pregnancies, the potential risks associated with multiple pregnancy require that every effort be made to achieve this goal. The evidence shows that treatments other than IVF (such as superovulation and clomiphene citrate) contribute significantly to the incidence of multiple pregnancy. There is an urgent need for studies to understand better the usage and application of these other fertility technologies within Canada, as well as the non-financial barriers to treatment. The final consensus of the expert panel was that with adequate funding and good access to treatment, it will be possible to achieve the goal of reducing IVF-related multiple pregnancy rates in Canada by 50%.",
