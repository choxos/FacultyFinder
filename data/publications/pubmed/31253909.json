  "title": "Monitoring erosive toothwear: BEWE, a simple tool to protect patients and the profession.",
  "abstract": "Erosive tooth wear is the third most commonly observed oral condition after caries and periodontal disease, with a prevalence similar to that of dentine hypersensitivity. However, it is not a condition that is routinely screened, or monitored, as part of the standard dental examination. Following a meeting held in 2018, this paper considers the outlook for erosive tooth wear and the need for dental professionals to monitor for signs of the condition as part of an oral health assessment, to provide protection for patients and the profession. The use of the basic erosive wear examination (BEWE) is proposed as a simple screening tool designed to detect erosive tooth wear in clinical practice.",
