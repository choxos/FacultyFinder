  "title": "Punto Seguro: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Using Conditional Economic Incentives to Reduce Sexually Transmitted Infection Risks in Mexico.",
  "abstract": "Randomized controlled pilot evaluated effect of conditional economic incentives (CEIs) on number of sex partners, condom use, and incident sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among male sex workers in Mexico City. Incentives were contingent on testing free of new curable STIs and/or clinic attendance. We assessed outcomes for n = 227 participants at 6 and 12 months (during active phase with incentives), and then at 18 months (with incentives removed). We used intention-to-treat and inverse probability weighting for the analysis. During active phase, CEIs increased clinic visits (10-13 percentage points) and increased condom use (10-15 percentage points) for CEI groups relative to controls. The effect on condom use was not sustained once CEIs were removed. CEIs did not have an effect on number of partners or incident STIs. Conditional incentives for male sex workers can increase linkage to care and retention and reduce some HIV/STI risks such as condomless sex, while incentives are in place.",
