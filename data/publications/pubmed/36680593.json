  "abstract": "Drainage from chronic wounds can significantly negatively impact a patient's quality of life. Change in severity of wound drainage is an important measure of treatment efficacy for wounds. This study reviews existing tools used to assess wound drainage. Qualitative drainage tools are overall less burdensome, and however, differences in user interpretation may reduce inter-rater reliability. Quantitative drainage tools enable more reliable comparisons of drainage severity and treatment response between patients but sometimes require equipment to administer, increasing responder burden. Gaps in the current wound drainage measurement landscape are highlighted. Many of the existing scales have not been validated in robust studies. There is also a lack of validated global drainage measurement tools for patients with chronic inflammatory skin disorders with drainage, such as hidradenitis suppurativa or pyoderma gangrenosum. Development of a succinct drainage measurement tool for inflammatory skin diseases where drainage is a prominent symptom will improve monitoring of meaningful treatment response.",
