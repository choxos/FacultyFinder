  "title": "The prevalence of monotherapy and combination therapy in hypertension in China from 2019 to 2021: A nationwide population-based cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "There are no nationwide surveys on antihypertensive drugs in China. In order to assess the current status of antihypertensive drug therapy in patients with hypertension and analyzed factors that may affect combination therapy, using convenience sampling, we recruited 305,624 patients with hypertension from the Chinese Cardiovascular Association Database-Hypertension Center between January 2019 and December 2021. Chi-squared test was performed to analyze the administered antihypertensive drug types and their combinations in different hospital settings. Logistic regression was used to assess the factors influencing combination therapy. We found around 33.1% of the participants had stage 2 and above hypertension, of which 67.9% were treated with combination therapy. In community or general hospitals, the most common monotherapy was calcium channel blockers (CCB), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor inhibitor (ACEI/ARB) and diuretic were the main single-pill combinations (SPCs), and ACEI/ARB and CCB were the main free combination. From 2019 to 2021, the rates of combination therapy increased (58.8%-64.1%) with SPCs from 25.9% to 31.0% and free combination from 31.9% to 32.6%. Patients aged < 60 years, with stage 2 and above hypertension, with an education level of high school and above, visiting general hospitals, living in the eastern region of China, with hypertension risk factors and comorbidities, and without anxiety or depression were more likely to receive combination therapy (all P < .05). The combination therapy use rate increased yearly and the rate of SPCs rose obviously. Individual, hospital, and regional differences in patients with hypertension influenced combination therapy.",
