  "title": "Iterative Development of a Tailored mHealth Intervention for Adolescent and Young Adult Survivors of Childhood Cancer.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Methods for developing mobile health (mHealth) interventions are not well described. To guide the development of future mHealth interventions, we describe the application of the agile science framework to iteratively develop a mHealth intervention for adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: We created the AYA STEPS mobile app (AYA Self-management via Texting, Education, and Plans for Survivorship) by modifying and integrating two existing programs: an online survivorship care plan (SCP) generator and a text messaging self-management intervention for AYA off treatment. The iterative development process involved three stages of agile science: 1) Formative work, 2) Obtaining feedback about the first AYA STEPS prototype, and 3) Pilot testing and finalization of a prototype. We determined preferences of AYA stakeholders as well as discovered and addressed technology problems prior to beginning a subsequent randomized controlled trial. RESULTS: AYA survivors reported that the app and the embedded tailored messages related to their health and SCP, were easy to use and generally satisfying and beneficial. Usage data supported that AYA were engaged in the app. Technology glitches were discovered in the pilot and addressed. CONCLUSIONS: The iterative development of AYA STEPS was essential for creating a consistent and acceptable end user experience. This study serves as one example of how behavioral scientists may apply agile science to their own mHealth research.",
