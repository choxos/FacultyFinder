  "title": "Impact of atrial fibrillation on productivity in working-age patients: an analysis of Swiss-AF prospective cohort study data.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: We aimed to explore atrial fibrillation (AF)-induced productivity losses in working-age atrial fibrillation patients and to estimate atrial fibrillation-related indirect costs. METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, the Swiss Atrial Fibrillation prospective cohort study (Swiss-AF) enrolled 217 working-age patients with documented atrial fibrillation. Self-reported changes in professional activity and the reasons thereof were descriptively analysed over 8 years of follow-up or until patients reached the retirement age. Results were put into perspective, and indirect costs were planned to be estimated, through comparison with a general population-based, age-, sex- and year-matched comparison sample from the Swiss labour force survey (SLFS). RESULTS: Of 217 analysed Swiss-AF patients, 14.7% reported a professional activity change (9.2% stop, 5.5% reduction) due to atrial fibrillation before the end of observation. Of those working at enrolment (n = 157), 3.8% had a subsequent professional activity change due to atrial fibrillation, 11.6% due to other reasons. Patients were more likely to report an impact of atrial fibrillation on professional activity if they had had atrial fibrillation longer and were closer to the retirement age. Slightly fewer Swiss-AF patients were employed (75%) than in the comparison sample (77%). For those working however, the degree of employment was higher (88% vs 83%). Lack of differences between the Swiss-AF patients and the comparison sample indicated no relevant indirect costs of atrial fibrillation due to lost productivity. CONCLUSION: Only a minority of atrial fibrillation patients reported a negative impact of atrial fibrillation on their professional activity. Professional activity changes due to other reasons were reported more frequently. Compared with the general population, atrial fibrillation did not cause distinct differences.",
