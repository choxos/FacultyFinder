  "title": "Effect of a Legal Clinic Program Within an Urban Primary Health Care Center on Social Determinants of Health: A Program Evaluation.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Individuals living in poverty often visit primary healthcare clinics for health problems stemming from unmet legal needs. We examined the impact of a medical-legal partnership on improving the social determinants of health (SDoH), health-related quality of life, and perceived health status of attendees of a Legal Clinic Program (LCP). METHODS: This was a pre-post program evaluation of a weekly LCP established within an urban primary healthcare clinic to provide free legal consultation. Patients aged 18 years or older were either approached or referred to complete a screening tool to identify potential legal needs. Those identified with potential legal needs were offered an appointment with LCP lawyers who provided legal counsel, referrals, and services. For those who attended the LCP, changes in SDoH and health indicators were collected via a self-reported survey 6 months after they attended the LCP and compared to their baseline scores using paired t-tests, McNemar's test for paired proportions, and the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test for related samples. RESULTS: During the 6-month evaluation period, 31 participants attended the LCP and completed both the baseline and 6-month surveys; 67.8% were female, 64.5% were white, 90.3% were not working full-time, and 61.3% had a household income of $700 to 1800 per month. At follow-up, 25.8% were receiving at least 1 new benefit and there was a statistically significant reduction in food insecurity (35.5% vs 9.7%, P < .05). Also, perceived health status using the visual analog scale (ranges from 0 to 100) significantly improved from 42.5 points (SD = 25.3) at baseline to 56.6 points (SD = 19.6) after 6 months (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The LCP has the potential to improve the health and wellbeing of patients in primary healthcare clinics by addressing unmet legal needs and SDoH.",
