  "abstract": "Numerous studies have indicated that there might be great differences among different populations in Europe and Asia in terms of home morning and evening blood pressure (BP). Thus, the authors performed a systematic review to determine the quantitative differences of BP measured at clinic versus at home in the morning and in the evening in Europe and Asia. PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases were searched up to October 2021. Studies that compared clinic BP with home morning and (or) home evening BP in European and Asian populations were included. A random effect model was applied to pool the differences between clinic BP and home morning/evening BP. Thirty-five studies, for a total of 49 432 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. Mean clinic systolic blood pressure (SBP) values were significantly higher than home morning SBP values by 3.79 mmHg (95% CI, 2.77-4.80). The differences were much larger in Europe [(6.53 mmHg (95% CI, 4.10-8.97)] than in Asia [(2.70 mmHg (95% CI, 1.74-3.66)], and the region was a significant predictor for the differences. Mean clinic SBP values were also significantly higher than home evening SBP values by 6.59 mmHg (95% CI, 4.98-8.21). The differences were much smaller in Europe [5.85 mmHg (95% CI, 3.24-8.45)] than in Asia [7.13 mmHg (95% CI, 4.92-9.35)], while age and clinic SBP might contribute to it. Our findings showed that the difference between clinic and home morning SBP was much larger in European than Asian populations, whereas the difference between clinic and home evening SBP was the opposite. The differing characteristics of the region, ethnic, age, and clinic BP might explain the diversities.",
