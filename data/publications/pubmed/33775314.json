  "title": "Effect of desmopressin on hematoma expansion in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effect of desmopressin on hematoma expansion (HE) in antiplatelet-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (AA-ICH). Secondary outcomes examined were the rate of thrombotic complications and neurologic outcome. Three databases were searched (Pubmed, Scopus, and Cochrane) for randomized clinical trials and controlled studies comparing desmopressin versus controls in adult patients with AA-ICH. The Mantel-Haenszel method was applied to calculate an overall effect estimate for each outcome by combining stratum-specific risk ratio (RR). Risk of bias was computed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (42020190234). Three retrospective controlled studies involving 263 patients were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to controls, desmopressin was associated with a non-significant reduction in HE (19.1% vs. 30%; RR:0.61; 95%CI, 0.27-1.39; P = 0.24), a similar rate of thrombotic events (5.5% vs. 9.9%; RR:0.47; 95%CI, 0.17-1.31; P = 0.15), and significantly worse neurologic outcome (mRS â‰¥ 4) (66.3% vs. 50%; RR:1.36; 95%CI, 1.08-1.7; P = 0.008). Qualitative analysis of included studies for each outcome revealed low to moderate risk of bias. The available literature does not support the routine use of desmopressin in the setting of AA-ICH. Until larger prospective trials are performed, the administration of desmopressin should be judiciously considered on a case-by-case basis.",
