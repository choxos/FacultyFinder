  "title": "Regular deworming and seasonality are potential challenges but also offer opportunities for hookworm elimination.",
  "abstract": "The global health community has targeted the elimination of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) including soil-transmitted helminthiasis by 2030. The elimination strategy has not changed from that of control using regular mass drug administration (MDA) with albendazole, WASH and education. Already doubts have been expressed about this achievement, principally because drugs do not interrupt transmission. We report here the findings of a cohort study aimed to identify host modifiable and environmental factors associated with hookworm infection and reinfection in rural communities in Kintampo North Municipality, Ghana. Faecal samples of 564 consented participants were screened for intestinal parasites at baseline, 9 months and 24 months using the Kato-Katz method. At each time point, positive cases were treated with a single dose of albendazole (400 mg) and their samples were again screened 10-14 days post-treatment to record treatment failures. The hookworm prevalence at the three-time points was 16.7%, 9.22% and 5.3% respectively, whilst treatment failure rates were 17.25%, 29.03% and 40.9% respectively. The intensities of hookworm infection (in eggs per gram) at the time points were 138.3, 40.5 and 135, which showed a likely association with wet and dry seasons. We posit that the very low intensity of hookworm infections in humans during the dry season offers a window of opportunity for any intervention that could drastically reduce the community worm burden before the rainy season.",
