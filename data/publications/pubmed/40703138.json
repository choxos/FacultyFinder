  "abstract": "AIMS: To assess the performance of an artificial intelligence-enabled electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) algorithm in identifying patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AS) in an Asian cohort from a tertiary care centre. METHODS AND RESULTS: We identified a randomly selected patients â‰¥60 years old who underwent echocardiography and ECG within in 31 days between 2012 and 2021 at the Samsung Medical Center in Korea. Patients with previous cardiac surgery, prosthetic valves, or pacemakers were excluded. The AI-ECG model, originally developed and validated by Mayo Clinic in the USA, was applied without fine-tuning. Performance metrics, including the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy, were calculated to compare AI-ECG predictions with TTE-confirmed AS status. Among 5425 patients, 1095 had moderate to severe AS, and 4330 age- and sex-matched patients without AS were included as controls. The AI-ECG model achieved an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.84-0.87) in detecting moderate to severe AS. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 0.83, 0.65, 0.37, 0.94, and 68.29%, respectively. The model's performance was consistent across various age and sex subgroups, with sensitivity increasing in older patients. CONCLUSION: The AI-ECG model developed in the USA demonstrated comparable performance in detecting moderate to severe AS in an Asian cohort compared with its original validation population. These findings highlight the potential utility of AI-ECG as a non-invasive screening tool for AS across diverse patient populations.",
