  "title": "Prevalence of overweight and obesity among indigenous populations in Canada: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies on overweight and obesity among indigenous peoples in Canada have been inconclusive. A systematic review was conducted on the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Canadian indigenous populations. Major bibliographic databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1990 and June 2013. We reviewed 594 abstracts and included 41 studies in the meta-analyses. Using the heterogeneity test (Cochrane Q) results, the overall prevalence was estimated using fixed- or random-effects model. Nonadults (<18 years) had a pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity at 29.8% (95% CI: 25.2-34.4) and 26.5% (95% CI: 21.8-31.3), respectively. The pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity among adults were 29.7% (95% CI: 28.2-31.2) and 36.6% (95% CI: 32.9-40.2), respectively. Adult males had higher overweight prevalence than females (34.6% vs. 26.6%), but lower obesity prevalence (31.6% vs. 40.6%). Nonadult girls had higher prevalence than boys [overweight: 27.6%; 95% CI: 22.6-32.7 vs. 24.7%; 95% CI: 19.0-30.5; obesity: 28.6%; 95% CI: 20.3-36.9 vs. 25.1%; 95% CI: 13.8-36.4]. Nonadult Inuit had the highest overweight and lowest obesity prevalence. Although Inuit adult had the lowest prevalence of overweight (28.7%; 95% CI: 27.3-30.2) and obesity (32.3%; 95% CI: 25.5-39.1), it was relatively high. This study highlights the need for nutritional intervention programs for obesity prevention among indigenous populations in Canada.",
