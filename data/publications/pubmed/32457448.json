  "abstract": "Type-2 immunity is characterised by interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13, eosinophilia, mucus production, IgE, and alternatively activated macrophages (AAM). However, despite the lack of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL1, neutrophils, a feature of type-1 immunity, are observed in type-2 responses. Consequently, alternative mechanisms must exist to ensure that neutrophils can contribute to type-2 immune reactions without escalation of deleterious inflammation. We now demonstrate that type-2 immune-associated neutrophil infiltration is regulated by the mouse RNase A homologue, eosinophil-associated ribonuclease 11 (Ear11), which is secreted by AAM downstream of IL-25-stimulated ILC2. Transgenic overexpression of Ear11 resulted in tissue neutrophilia, whereas Ear11-deficient mice have fewer resting tissue neutrophils, whilst other type-2 immune responses are not impaired. Notably, administration of recombinant mouse Ear11 increases neutrophil motility and recruitment. Thus, Ear11 helps maintain tissue neutrophils at homoeostasis and during type-2 reactions when chemokine-producing classically activated macrophages are infrequently elicited.",
