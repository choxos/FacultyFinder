  "title": "Periprosthetic Infection after Endoprosthetic Reconstruction for Femoral Bone Metastases: Incidence and Risk Factors, a Single Center Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to identify the incidence and risk factors of periprosthetic infections following endoprosthetic reconstruction of femoral metastatic bone disease (MBD). In this population with MBD, the marked impact of infection on the patient's systemic treatment highlights the importance of understanding both the incidence and associated risk factors. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included a total of 140 patients who underwent endoprosthetic reconstruction for femoral MBD at a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea between 2009 and 2019. Infection-free survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and Cox proportional hazards model analyses were performed to evaluate the risk factors associated with periprosthetic infection. RESULTS: The incidence of periprosthetic infection in patients who underwent endoprosthetic reconstruction for femoral MBD was 9% (12 out of 140 patients). Risk factors for periprosthetic infection were hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as the primary tumor (hazard ratio [HR], 6.08; 95% CI, 1.63-22.6; p = 0.007) and low preoperative absolute neutrophil count (HR, 6.99; 95% CI, 1.79-27.4; p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with femoral MBD had a 9% risk of developing a periprosthetic infection. Given their limited life expectancy, this translated to a substantial rate of 58.9 infections per 1,000 person-joint-years. Possible risk factors for periprosthetic infection were low preoperative absolute neutrophil count and HCC as the primary tumor. The high incidence of periprosthetic infection and its associated risk factors should be considered in patients undergoing endoprosthetic reconstruction for femoral MBD.",
