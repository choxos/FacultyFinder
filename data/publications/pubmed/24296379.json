  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The article provides an overview of efforts to identify and validate biomarkers in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a discussion of the challenges confronting researchers in this area. RECENT FINDINGS: Although various putative biomarkers have been investigated in ARDS, the data have been largely disappointing and the 'troponin' of ARDS remains elusive. Establishing a relationship between measurable biological processes and clinical outcomes is vital to advancing clinical trials in ARDS and expanding our arsenal of treatments for this complex syndrome. SUMMARY: This article summarizes the current status of ARDS biomarker research and provides a framework for future investigation.",
