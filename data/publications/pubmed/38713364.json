  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: South Asians represent the largest non-white ethnic group in Canada and were disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to determine the factors associated with vaccine hesitancy in South Asian Canadians. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of vaccine hesitancy using data collected at the baseline assessment of a prospective cohort study, COVID CommUNITY South Asian. Participants (18 + years) were recruited from the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area in Ontario (ON) and the Greater Vancouver Area in British Columbia (BC) between April and November 2021. Demographic characteristics and vaccine attitudes measured by the Vaccine Attitudes Examination (VAX) scale were collected. Each item is scored on a 6-point Likert scale, and higher scores reflect greater hesitancy. A multivariable linear mixed effects model was used to identify sociodemographic factors associated with vaccine hesitancy, adjusting for multiple covariates. RESULTS: A total of 1496 self-identified South Asians (52% female) were analyzed (mean age = 38.5 years; standard deviation (SD): 15.3). The mean VAX score was 3.2, SD: 0.8 [range: 1.0‒6.0]. Factors associated with vaccine hesitancy included: time since immigration (p = 0.04), previous COVID-19 infection (p < 0.001), marital status (p < 0.001), living in a multigenerational household (p = 0.03), age (p = 0.02), education (p < 0.001), and employment status (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among South Asians living in ON and BC, time since immigration, prior COVID-19 infection, marital status, living in a multigenerational household, age, education, and employment status were associated with vaccine hesitancy. This information can be used to address vaccine hesitancy in the South Asian population in future COVID-19 waves or pandemics.",
