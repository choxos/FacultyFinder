  "title": "Trilobatin regulates glucose metabolism by ameliorating oxidative stress and insulin resistance in vivo and in vitro.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Trilobatin, a glycosylated dihydrochalcone, has been reported to have anti-diabetic properties. However, the underlying mechanism remains unexplained. METHODS: In this investigation, the regulation of trilobatin on glucose metabolism of insulin resistance (IR)-HepG2 cells and streptozocin (STZ)-induced mice and its mechanism were evaluated. KEY FINDINGS: Different doses of trilobatin (5, 10 and 20 μM) increased glucose consumption, glycogen content, hexokinase (HK), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activity in IR-HepG2 cells. Among them, the HK and PK activity in IR-HepG2 cells treated with 20 μM trilobatin were 1.84 and 2.05 times than those of the IR-group. The overeating, body and tissue weight, insulin levels, liver damage, and lipid accumulation of STZ-induced mice were improved after feeding with different doses of trilobatin (10, 50, and 100 mg/kg/d) for 4 weeks. Compared with STZ-induced mice, fasting blood glucose decreased by 61.11% and fasting insulin (FINS) increased by 48.6% after feeding trilobatin (100 mg/kg/d). Meanwhile, data from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed trilobatin ameliorated glycogen synthesis via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) signaling pathway in IR-HepG2 cells and in STZ-induced mice. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that trilobatin ameliorated oxidative stress by regulating the mRNA expression of nuclear erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2)/kelch-like ECH associated protein-1 (Keap-1) pathway as well as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1). CONCLUSIONS: Our research reveals a novel pharmacological activity of trilobatin: regulating glucose metabolism through PI3K/Akt/GSK-3β and Nrf2/Keap-1 signaling pathways, improving insulin resistance and reducing oxidative stress. Trilobatin can be used as a reliable drug resource for the treatment of glucose metabolism disorders.",
