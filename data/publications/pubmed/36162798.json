  "title": "Impact of Reaction Setting on the Management, Severity, and Outcome of Pediatric Food-Induced Anaphylaxis: A Cross-Sectional Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prompt epinephrine autoinjector (EAI) use is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. However, limited Canadian data exist on the impact of reaction location on EAI use for food-induced anaphylaxis (FIA). OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the setting, management, and severity of pediatric FIA. METHODS: We recruited children presenting with FIA from 11 Canadian emergency departments. Patient demographics and the setting, management, and symptoms of FIA were collected by standardized questionnaire. Factors associated with prehospital EAI use and reaction severity were determined by logistic regression. RESULTS: We recruited 3,604 children; 60.2% were male and the median age was 5.0 years (interquartile range 1.8-11.0). Among cases with a known location of FIA (85.0%), home was the most common setting (68.1%), followed by school/daycare (12.8%), other locations (11.4%; eg, park, car), and restaurants (7.4%). In the prehospital setting, EAI was administered in 36.7% of reactions at home, 66.7% in school/daycare, 40.2% in other locations, and 44.5% in restaurants. Relative to reactions occurring at school/daycare, prehospital EAI use was less likely at home (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.80; 95% CI 0.76-0.84), in restaurants (aOR 0.81; 95% CI 0.75-0.87), and in other settings (aOR 0.77; 95% CI 0.73-0.83), when data were adjusted for reaction severity, sex, age, comorbidities, and province. The FIA setting was not associated with reaction severity or hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital EAI use was higher at school/daycare than in other settings, potentially owing to the presence of policies and training on FIA. Setting-specific interventions including educational programs and policies/laws mandating training and stocking an EAI may improve anaphylaxis recognition and treatment.",
