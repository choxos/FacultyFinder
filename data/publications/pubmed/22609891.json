  "title": "Relation between pulmonary function and 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease among healthy men and women in Italy: the Moli-sani Project.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary dysfunction could influence the onset and the evolution of cardiovascular disorders. This study evaluated whether pulmonary dysfunction based on spirometry, plethysmography and carbon monoxide diffusion test is associated with the estimated risk of cardiovascular disease in 10 years. DESIGN: We performed a cross-sectional general population-based cohort study. METHODS: The Moli-sani Project is a population-based cohort study of subjects aged ≥35 years, randomly recruited from the general population in Italy. Cardiovascular risk in 10 years was predicted by the CUORE score which provides an estimate of the probability of a first coronary or cerebrovascular event in the next 10 years, based on a risk equation derived from Italian cohorts. Out of 12,933 subjects with high-quality flow/volume manoeuvre, 8,132 subjects had suitable plethysmography and 3,422 carbon monoxide diffusion (carbon monoxide alveolar diffusion test [DLCO]). RESULTS: In multivariate analyses, reduced pulmonary function expressed by forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) and total lung capacity (TLC) were inversely associated with CUORE score both in men and in women, independently of other risk factors such as age, height, smoking habits, total cigarettes exposure (pack-years), pulmonary disease, body mass index, social status and physical activity. In contrast, there was no association between FEV1/FVC ratio, residual volume, DLCO and CUORE risk score. CONCLUSIONS: In both genders from an adult general Italian population, pulmonary function decline is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. These results suggest that pulmonary monitoring could be useful to more accurately predict cardiovascular risk.",
