  "abstract": "Transient episodes of ischemic preconditioning (PC) render myocardium protected against subsequent lethal injury after ischemia and reperfusion. Recent studies indicate that application of short, repetitive ischemia only during the onset of reperfusion after the lethal ischemic event may obtain equivalent protection. We assessed whether such ischemic postconditioning (Postcon) is cardioprotective in pigs by limiting lethal injury. Pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized, open-chest pigs underwent 30 min of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 3-h reflow. PC was elicited by two cycles of 5-min occlusion plus 10-min reperfusion before the 30-min occlusion period. Postcon was elicited by three cycles of 30-s reperfusion, followed by 30-s reocclusion, after the 30-min occlusion period and before the 3-h reflow. Infarct size (%area-at-risk using triphenyltetrazolium chloride macrochemistry; means +/- SE) after 30 min of ischemia was 26.5 +/- 5.2% (n = 7 hearts/treatment group). PC markedly limited myocardial infarct size (2.8 +/- 1.2%, n = 7 hearts/treatment group, P < 0.05 vs. controls). However, Postcon had no effect on infarct size (37.8 +/- 5.1%, n = 7 hearts/treatment group). Within the subendocardium, Postcon increased phosphorylation of Akt (74 +/- 12%) and ERK1/2 (56 +/- 10%) compared with control hearts subjected only to 30-min occlusion and 15-min reperfusion (P < or = 0.05), and these changes were not different from the response triggered by PC (n = 5 hearts/treatment group). Phosphorylation of downstream p70S6K was also equivalent in PC and Postcon groups. These data do not support the hypothesis that application of 30-s cycles of repetitive ischemia during reperfusion exerts a protective effect on pig hearts subjected to lethal ischemia, but this is not due to a failure to phosphorylate ERK and Akt during early reperfusion.",
