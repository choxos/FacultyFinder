  "title": "Interactions of lean soft-tissue and chemotherapy toxicities in patients receiving anti-cancer treatments.",
  "abstract": "Use of cross-sectional imaging to identify whole-body lean soft-tissue mass has recently emerged as an attractive prognostic factor for chemotherapy toxicities. Beyond that, there is increasing interest in use of lean soft-tissue mass as a more accurate method for dosing chemotherapy, as compared to body surface area. In this review, we summarize the current evidence that supports interactions between skeletal muscle and chemotherapy, the role of lean soft tissue in predicting chemotherapy toxicities and potential use of an alternate method of chemotherapeutic dosing, all based on quantification of skeletal muscle mass by computed tomography.",
