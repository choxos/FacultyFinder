  "title": "Ticagrelor With or Without Aspirin in Chinese Patients Undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A TWILIGHT China Substudy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The risk/benefit tradeoff of dual antiplatelet therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention may vary in East Asian patients as compared with their non-East Asian counterparts. METHODS: The double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized TWILIGHT trial (Ticagrelor With Aspirin or Alone in High-Risk Patients After Coronary Intervention) enrolled patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention. After 3 months of treatment with ticagrelor plus aspirin, event-free and adherent patients remained on ticagrelor and were randomly assigned to receive aspirin or placebo for 1 year. The primary end point was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding; the key secondary end point was the first occurrence of death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. RESULTS: Of 9006 enrolled and 7119 randomized patients in TWILIGHT, 1169 patients (13.0%) were enrolled at 27 Chinese sites in this prespecified substudy, of whom 1028 (14.4%) patients were randomized after 3 months. The incidence of the primary end point was 6.2% in the ticagrelor+aspirin group versus 3.5% in the ticagrelor+placebo group between randomization and 1 year (hazard ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.31-0.99]; P=0.048). The key secondary end point occurred in 3.4% of patients in the ticagrelor+aspirin group versus 2.4% in the ticagrelor+placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.33-1.46]; P=0.34). There was no interaction between the region of randomization (China versus the rest of the world) and randomized treatment assignment in terms of the primary or key secondary end points. CONCLUSIONS: Ticagrelor monotherapy significantly reduced clinically relevant bleeding without increasing ischemic events as compared with ticagrelor plus aspirin in Chinese patients undergoing high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention.
