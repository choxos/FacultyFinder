  "title": "Continuous Glucose Monitor Use Prevents Glycemic Deterioration in Insulin-Treated Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.",
  "abstract": "Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is indicated in poorly controlled insulin-treated patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) to improve glycemic control and reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, but the benefits of CGM for lower risk patients have not been well studied. Among 17,422 insulin-treated patients with T2D with hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <8% and no recent severe hypoglycemia (based on emergency room visits or hospitalizations), CGM initiation occurred in 149 patients (17,273 noninitiators served as reference). Changes in HbA1c and severe hypoglycemia rates for the 12 months before and after CGM initiation were calculated. CGM initiation was associated with decreased HbA1c (-0.06%), whereas noninitiation was associated with increased HbA1c (+0.32%); a weighted adjusted difference-in-difference model of change in HbA1c yielded a net benefit of -0.30%; 95% CI -0.50%, -0.10%; P = 0.004). No significant differences were observed for severe hypoglycemia. CGM may be useful in preventing glycemic deterioration in well-controlled patients with insulin-treated T2D.",
