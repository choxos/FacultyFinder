  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Primary spinal malignant melanoma (PSMM) of extramedullary intradural origin is a rare malignant condition with limited current literature regarding its clinical course, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, treatment strategies, and outcomes. CASE DISCUSSION: This is a case report of a patient with PSMM who was treated with surgery followed by radiotherapy for his residual disease in Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust, Pakistan. The clinical and radiological findings of this case were retrospectively analyzed using the Hospital Information System. PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATIONS: PSMM of extramedullary intradural origin is a rare malignant tumor that shows characteristic findings on MRI. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment, and radiotherapy is useful for residual disease.",
