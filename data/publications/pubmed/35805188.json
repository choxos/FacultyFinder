  "abstract": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a common clinical disease with a high disability rate. Injury of bone microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) caused by glucocorticoid administration is one of the important causes of ONFH, and there is currently a lack of effective clinical treatments. Extracellular vesicles derived from bone stem cells (BMSC-EVs) can prevent ONFH by promoting angiogenesis and can inhibit cell apoptosis by regulating autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of extracellular vesicles derived from bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) on a glucocorticoid-induced injury of BMECs and possible mechanisms. We found that BMSC-EVs attenuated glucocorticoid-induced viability, angiogenesis capacity injury, and the apoptosis of BMECs. BMSC-EVs increased the LC3 level, but decreased p62 (an autophagy protein receptor) expression, suggesting that BMSC-Exos activated autophagy in glucocorticoid-treated BMECs. The protective effects of BMSC-EVs on the glucocorticoid-induced injury of BMECs was mimicked by a known stimulator of autophagy (rapamycin) and could be enhanced by co-treatment with an autophagy inhibitor (LY294002). BMSC-EVs also suppressed the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, which regulates cell autophagy, in glucocorticoid-treated BMECs. In conclusion, the results indicate that BMSC-EVs prevent the glucocorticoid-induced injury of BMECs by regulating autophagy via the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.",
