  "title": "Cost Disparities with Age in the Treatment of Advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have noted associations between age and healthcare costs in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the drivers of cost disparities have not yet been fully examined. This retrospective cohort study included deceased patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC in Ontario from 1 April 2008 to 30 March 2014. Variables of interest were extracted from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. Average monthly cancer-attributable costs (CACs), defined as the net additional costs due to cancer, determined by subtracting pre-diagnosis costs from post-diagnosis costs, were calculated by phases of care (staging, initial, continuing, and end-of-life). Regression analyses assessed predictors of cost variability. The median age of the 14,655 patients was 65 to 69 years; 54% were male and 29% had received chemotherapy. On both univariate and multivariate analysis, CACs decreased with age after cancer diagnosis across all phases of care (p < 0.001). Receiving chemotherapy contributed to higher costs in staging, initial, and continuing phases (OR 2.11, 95% C.I. 1.90-2.33, p < 0.01), and lower costs in the end-of-life phase (OR 0.77, 95% C.I. 0.72-0.81, p < 0.01). Our study showed that older patients had higher baseline healthcare costs and lower cancer-attributable costs following diagnosis of advanced NSCLC. Cost drivers, including treatment and gender, varied by phase of care.",
