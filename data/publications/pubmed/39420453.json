  "title": "Clinical Significance Unveiled: Understanding the Meaning of FACE-Q Skin Cancer Scores for Improved Patient Care.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module is a Patient-Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) utilized to assess outcomes following facial skin cancer resection. However, the lack of Minimal Important Difference (MID) estimates hinders the interpretability of the PROM scores. This study established MID estimates for the four outcome scales from the FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module using distribution-based methods. METHODS: A prospective cohort study at four hospitals in the United States, enrolled participants who underwent Mohs Micrographic Surgery (MMS) for facial skin cancer between April 2020 and April 2022. Participants completed the Satisfaction with Facial Appearance, Appearance-related Psychosocial Distress, Cancer Worry, and Appraisal of Scars scales at four time points: pre-operatively, 2-week, 6-month, and 1-year post-surgery. RESULTS: A total of 990 patients participated in the study, with completion rates of 98.4% for the pre-operative assessment, 70.8% at 2 weeks, 59.3% at 6 months, and 60.4% at 1 year. MID estimates, calculated using 0.2 standard deviation and 0.2 standardized response mean, were determined for the four scales. The mean MID estimates, based on a Rasch transformed score ranging from 0 to 100, were 5 for the Appraisal of Scars scale and 4 for the remaining three scales. CONCLUSION: This multicenter study provides valuable MID estimates for the FACE-Q Skin Cancer Module, specifically for the MMS patient population, enabling clinicians and researchers to better interpret scores, determine appropriate sample sizes, and apply the findings in clinical care.",
