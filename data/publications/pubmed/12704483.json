  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Troponin T (cTnT) and troponin I (cTnI) are present in the sera of some heart failure (HF) patients and have potential importance as prognostic markers. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate the prognostic value of cTnT and cTnI in well-characterized HF patients and clarify their relationship to other clinical markers of HF severity. METHODS: cTnT and cTnI were measured in 78 HF patients (45 inpatients, 33 outpatients) who were followed up prospectively for 12 months. RESULTS: Plasma cTnT (> or =0.02 ng/mL) and cTnI (> or =0.3 ng/mL) were detected in 51% and 46% of patients, respectively. These patients were more likely to be inpatients (70% versus 45% for cTnT, 75% versus 43% for cTnI, P<0.05 for both), have a higher plasma creatinine (153 versus 119 micromol/L for cTnT; 157 versus 118 micromol/L for cTnI, P<0.05) and lower plasma sodium (134 versus 138 mmol/L for both, P<0.05). At 12 months, they were more likely to have died or undergone cardiac transplantation (41% versus 14%, P=0.01 for cTnT; 43% versus 15%, P=0.004 for cTnI). After adjustment for New York Heart Association class, plasma sodium and inpatient status, a significant association with events was still evident for both troponins. CONCLUSIONS: Both cTnT and cTnI are strongly associated with other clinical indicators of HF severity and remain independent predictors of prognosis after adjustment for these factors. These results indicate a potential role for cTnT and cTnI in the clinical management of HF patients.",
