  "title": "Tri-ponderal mass index in survivors of childhood brain tumors: A cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "Survivors of childhood brain tumors (SCBT) face a higher risk of cardiometabolic disorders and premature mortality compared to the general population. Excess adiposity is a known risk factor for these comorbidities. However, while SCBT have higher adiposity compared to healthy controls, measuring adiposity in clinical practice involves access to specialized equipment and may impact busy clinical services. Tri-ponderal Mass Index (TMI; kg/m[3]) may be a superior measure of adiposity when compared to Body Mass Index (BMI; kg/m[2]). However, its use in determining adiposity in SCBT has not been assessed. This study aims to validate TMI as a clinical measure of adiposity in SCBT. This was a cross-sectional study including 44 SCBT (n = 20 female) and 137 (n = 64 female) non-cancer control children, 5-17 years of age. BMI and TMI were calculated from height and weight measurements. Fat mass percentage was assessed using bioelectrical impedance analysis and waist to hip and waist to height ratios were used to assess central adiposity. Regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, puberty and treatment. TMI demonstrated strong correlations to measures of total and central adiposity and predicted adiposity in SCBT and non-cancer controls, with stronger trends in the latter group. TMI may serve as a reliable clinical measure of adiposity in both SCBT and healthy children.",
