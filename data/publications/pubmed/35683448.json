  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It is important to gain a better understanding of mental health issues in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cerebral palsy (CP). In this cross-sectional study, we explore if demographics, social and clinical questionnaire scores, and cortisol levels in hair samples from AYA with CP are associated with higher scores on anxiety and/or depression questionnaires. METHODS: Data from a community-based sample of 63 AYA with CP (30 females; ages 16 to 30 (median age of 25)) were analyzed. Forty-one (65%) participants (20 females) provided a hair sample. Outcomes were assessed using bivariate linear regression analyses and hierarchical regression analyses. RESULTS: Clinical depressive and anxiety symptoms were present in 33% and 31% of participants, respectively. Family functioning, B = 9.62 (95%CI: 5.49-13.74), fatigue, B = 0.15 (95%CI: 0.05-0.25), and pain, B = 1.53 (95%CI: 0.48-2.58) were statistically significant predictors of depressive symptoms. Fatigue, B = 0.24 (95%CI: 0.12-0.35) and pain, B = 1.63 (95%CI: 0.33-2.94) were statistically significant predictors of anxiety. Cortisol levels from hair samples were not found to be associated with depressive symptoms or anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of mental health problems and co-occurring physical problems was found in AYA with CP. Integrating mental support into regular care for AYA with CP is recommended.",
