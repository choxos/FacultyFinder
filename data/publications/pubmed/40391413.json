  "title": "Gas-Related Symptoms in the General Population: Prevalence, Impact and Associated Factors in a Survey of the United States, the United Kingdom, and Mexico.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The daily prevalence, impact, and associated personal and health factors of gas-related gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in the general population are poorly understood and were investigated in a multi-national sample in this study. METHODS: Adults (18+ years) were surveyed nationwide via the Internet in the United States (USA), the United Kingdom (UK), and Mexico. The survey included the Intestinal Gas Questionnaire (IGQ), Rome IV diagnostic questions, anxiety, depression, somatization, and Quality of Life (QoL) questionnaires, as well as healthcare use and medical history questions. RESULTS: Five thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight respondents completed the survey: 49.1% female; mean age 44.8 years. IGQ global scores (range 0-100) were higher in Mexico (26.0) than in the United States (14.5) and the United Kingdom (13.7), higher among individuals under age 50 than older people, and only in Mexico higher in females than males. Almost all survey respondents (89%) reported one or more of the 7 IGQ gas-related symptoms in the past 24 h, with prevalence ranging from 39% for bloating to 81% for flatulence. Higher IGQ global scores correlated with lower physical (r = -0.46) and mental (r = -0.33) QoL; higher life stress (r = 0.43), anxiety (r = 0.43) and depression (r = 0.44) scores; and more non-GI physical symptoms (r = 0.50). A greater gas-related symptom burden was also related to higher prevalence of other gastroduodenal and bowel symptoms and increased doctor visits. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly all adults experience some daily gas-related symptoms. A higher burden of these symptoms is robustly associated with impairment in general QoL, increased anxiety, depression, stress, other GI symptoms, and increased healthcare needs.",
