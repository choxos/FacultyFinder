  "title": "Understanding inherited risk in unselected newly diagnosed patients with endometrial cancer.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes and PTEN, diagnostic of Lynch and Cowden syndromes, respectively, represent the only established inherited predisposition genes in endometrial cancer to date. The prevalence of other cancer predisposition genes remains unclear. We sought the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in unselected patients with endometrial cancer attending for surgical consultation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were prospectively consented (4/2016-5/2017) to an IRB-approved protocol of tumor-normal sequencing via a custom next-generation sequencing panel (MSK-IMPACT) with return of germline results for >75 cancer predisposition genes. Tumors were assessed for microsatellite instability (MSI). Per institutional standards, all tumors underwent Lynch syndrome screening via IHC for MMR proteins. RESULTS: Of 156 patients who consented to germline genetic testing, 118 (76%) had stage I disease. Tumors were endometrioid in 104 (67%), of which 60 (58%) were grade 1. Twenty-four pathogenic germline variants were identified in 22 patients (14%)-7 (4.5%) with highly penetrant cancer syndromes and 15 (9.6%) with variants in moderate-, low-penetrance, or recessive genes. Of these, 5 (21%) were in Lynch syndrome genes (2 MSH6, 2 PMS2, and 1 MLH1). All 5 tumors had concordant IHC staining; 2 (40%) were definitively MSI-high by next-generation sequencing. One patient had a known BRCA1 mutation; 1 had SMARCA4 deletion. The remaining 17 variants (71%) were incremental findings in moderate- and low-penetrance variants or genes associated with recessive disease. CONCLUSION: In unselected patients with predominantly low-risk, early-stage endometrial cancer, germline multi-gene panel testing identifies cancer predisposition gene variants in 14%. This finding may have implications for future cancer screening and risk-reduction recommendations. Universal IHC screening for Lynch syndrome successfully identifies the majority (71%) of high-penetrance germline mutations.",
