  "title": "Investigating the impact of stigma, accessibility and confidentiality on STI/STD/HIV self-testing among college students in the USA: protocol for a scoping review.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: In 2019, there were 2.5 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in the USA, young people aged 15-24 made up 61% and 42% of chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases, respectively. Moreover, the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were reported among college-aged students. In this paper, we outline our protocol to systematically review the published literature on, the use of STI/HIV self-test kits, increasing STI/HIV testing uptake, and stigma, access and confidentiality issues, among young adult college students in the USA. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This scoping review will be conducted and reported according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We will search electronic databases, OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL, for articles published in English from inception to the present. We will search other alternative sources such as ProQuest, Google Scholar and Google to identify grey literature. A two-step process will be used to identify eligible studies based on the defined inclusion criteria. First, the title and abstract of identified articles will be screened for possible inclusion. Second, full-text articles of relevant studies will be retrieved and screened for inclusion. Both screening steps will be done by two people independently. Finally, data will be extracted by two researchers working independently. Any arising disagreements will be resolved by consensus or by a third author. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study is a scoping review of the literature. Therefore, ethics approval is not required. Our plan for the dissemination of findings includes peer-reviewed manuscripts, conferences and webinars.",
