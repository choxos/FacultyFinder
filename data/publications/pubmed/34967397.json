  "title": "Decision Support Tool Identifies Ulcerative Colitis Patients Most Likely to Achieve Remission With Vedolizumab vs Adalimumab.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: We have previously validated a clinical decision support tool (CDST) (vedolizumab CDST [VDZ-CDST]) for clinical and endoscopic remission with VDZ in ulcerative colitis (UC). We aim to expand the validation for predicting histoendoscopic mucosal improvement (HEMI) with VDZ vs adalimumab (ADA). METHODS: In a post hoc analysis of a clinical trial for VDZ vs ADA in moderate to severe UC (VARSITY trial; NCT02497469), comparative accuracy was evaluated for the VDZ-CDST among an external validation cohort of VDZ- and ADA-treated patients for week 52 HEMI (Mayo endoscopic subscore 0-1 and Geboes score <3.2). Comparative effectiveness of VDZ and ADA was assessed after stratifying the cohort by baseline probability of response to VDZ using the VDZ-CDST. RESULTS: A total of 419 patients were included. The majority of patients enrolled in the VARSITY trial had a high (61%) or intermediate (29%) baseline predicted probability of response to VDZ. The baseline VDZ-CDST score was significantly more likely to predict week 52 HEMI for VDZ (area under the curve , 0.712; 95% confidence interval, 0.636-0.787) relative to ADA-treated patients (area under the curve, 0.538; 95% confidence interval, 0.377-0.700; P < .001 for AUC comparison). A significant (P < .001) association was observed between the VDZ-CDST and measured VDZ drug exposure over 52 weeks. Superiority of VDZ to ADA was only observed in patients with a high baseline predicted probability of response to VDZ. CONCLUSIONS: Superiority of VDZ to ADA is dependent on baseline probability of response, and a VDZ-CDST is capable of identifying UC patients most appropriate for VDZ vs ADA.",
