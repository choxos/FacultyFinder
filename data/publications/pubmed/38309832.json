  "title": "The effects of inulin-type fructans on cardiovascular disease risk factors: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Inulin-type fructans (ITF) are the leading prebiotics in the market. Available evidence provides conflicting results regarding the beneficial effects of ITF on cardiovascular disease risk factors. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ITF supplementation on cardiovascular disease risk factors in adults. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Emcare, AMED, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library databases from inception through May 15, 2022. Eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) administered ITF or placebo (for example, control, foods, diets) to adults for ≥2 weeks and reported one or more of the following: low, very-low, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, VLDL-C, HDL-C); total cholesterol; apolipoprotein A1 or B; triglycerides; fasting blood glucose; body mass index; body weight; waist circumference; waist-to-hip ratio; systolic or diastolic blood pressure; or hemoglobin A1c. Two reviewers independently and in duplicate screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We pooled data using random-effects model, and assessed the certainty of evidence (CoE) using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: We identified 1767 studies and included 55 RCTs with 2518 participants in meta-analyses. The pooled estimate showed that ITF supplementation reduced LDL-C [mean difference (MD) -0.14 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (95% CI: -0.24, -0.05), 38 RCTs, 1879 participants, very low CoE], triglycerides (MD -0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI: -0.12, -0.01, 40 RCTs, 1732 participants, low CoE), and body weight (MD -0.97 kg, 95% CI: -1.28, -0.66, 36 RCTs, 1672 participants, low CoE) but little to no significant effect on other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The effects were larger when study duration was ≥6 weeks and in pre-obese and obese participants. CONCLUSION: ITF may reduce low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and body weight. However, due to low to very low CoE, further well-designed and executed trials are needed to confirm these effects. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019136745.",
