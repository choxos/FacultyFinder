  "abstract": "Navigated total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is promoted as a means to improve limb and prosthesis alignment. This study involved a systematic review and meta-analysis for all randomized controlled trials in the literature from 1986 to 2009 comparing alignment outcomes between navigated and conventional TKA. Alignment outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model, and heterogeneity was explored. Twenty-three randomized controlled trials were identified comparing navigated vs conventional TKA involving 2541 patients. Patients who underwent navigated TKA had a significantly lower risk of implant malalignment at more than 3° as well as more than 2°. In addition, the risk of malalignment was reduced for the coronal plane tibial and femoral components as well as femoral and tibial slope. This meta-analysis demonstrates that navigated TKA provides significant improvement in prosthesis alignment.",
