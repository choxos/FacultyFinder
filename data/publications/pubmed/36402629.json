  "title": "A Quality Measurement Framework for Emergency Department Care of Psychiatric Emergencies.",
  "abstract": "As a primary access point for crisis psychiatric care, the emergency department (ED) is uniquely positioned to improve the quality of care and outcomes for patients with psychiatric emergencies. Quality measurement is the first key step in understanding the gaps and variations in emergency psychiatric care to guide quality improvement initiatives. Our objective was to develop a quality measurement framework informed by a comprehensive review and gap analysis of quality measures for ED psychiatric care. We conducted a systematic literature review and convened an expert panel in emergency medicine, psychiatry, and quality improvement to consider if and how existing quality measures evaluate the delivery of emergency psychiatric care in the ED setting. The expert panel reviewed 48 measures, of which 5 were standardized, and 3 had active National Quality Forum endorsement. Drawing from the measure appraisal, we developed a quality measurement framework with specific structural, process, and outcome measures across the ED care continuum. This framework can help shape an emergency medicine roadmap for future clinical quality improvement initiatives, research, and advocacy work designed to improve outcomes for patients presenting with psychiatric emergencies.",
