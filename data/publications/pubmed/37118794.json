  "title": "A scoping review on the decision-making dynamics for accepting or refusing the COVID-19 vaccination among adolescent and youth populations.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Global COVID-19 vaccinations rates among youth and adolescent populations prove that there is an opportunity to influence the acceptance for those who are unvaccinated and who are hesitant to receive additional doses. This study aimed to discover the acceptance and hesitancy reasons for choosing or refusing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. METHODS: A scoping review was conducted, and articles from three online databases, PubMed, Wiley, and Cochrane Library, were extracted and screened based on exclusion and PICOs criteria. A total of 21 studies were included in this review. Data highlighting study attributes, characteristics, and decision-making dynamics were extracted from the 21 studies and put into table format. RESULTS: The results showed that the primary drivers for accepting the COVID-19 vaccine include protecting oneself and close family/friends, fear of infection, professional recommendations, and employer obligations. Primary hesitancy factors include concerns about safety and side effects, effectiveness and efficacy, lack of trust in pharmaceuticals and government, conspiracies, and perceiving natural immunity as an alternative. CONCLUSIONS: This scoping review recommends that further research should be conducted with adolescent and youth populations that focus on identifying health behaviors and how they relate to vaccine policies and programs.",
