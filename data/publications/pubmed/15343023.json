  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Improvement of clinical care requires measurement of key dimensions of health care quality and action based on these measurements. Families, data analysts, clinicians, and administrators all have important roles to play. OBJECTIVE: To outline an approach to the measurement and utilization of family satisfaction data so that these data can be translated into health care quality improvement initiatives. DESIGN: Using a synthesis of existing knowledge about translation of satisfaction data into improvement strategies, this approach starts with selecting and implementing a satisfaction survey that reflects the key processes, providers, and places for the delivery of critical care. The survey results can be expressed in a way that prioritizes the opportunities for improvement. A comparison of results across sites, or use of a performance-importance grid, can assist in this prioritization process. High-priority items can then be addressed by the multidisciplinary intensive care unit team using a systematic, evidence-based approach to improvement that includes implementation strategies that have been proven to effectively change clinician behavior.",
