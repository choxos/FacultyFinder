  "abstract": "A collaborative exchange of ideas occurred at The Psoriatic Disease Payer Advisory Panel sponsored by International Dermatology Outcomes Measures (IDEOM) and The National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) in January, 2016. Patient, provider, payer, pharmaceutical industry, IDEOM board member, and NPF leader representatives shared perspectives to address the unmet needs in the treatment of psoriatic patients. The payers who play a crucial role in controlling treatment access and improving patient outcomes played a pivotal role in the discussion. Progress made during the Payer Advisory Panel will ultimately advance psoriatic initiatives and help to address the persistent challenges of all vested stakeholders. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol. </em>2016;15(5):641-644.",
