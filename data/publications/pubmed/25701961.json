  "title": "A case-matched study of the differences in bone mineral density 1 year after 3 different bariatric procedures.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have reported decreased bone mineral density (BMD) after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banded plication (LAGBP) is a novel procedure resulting in a dual restrictive mechanism of weight loss without altering gastrointestinal anatomy. The objectives of this study were to compare the BMD changes at 1 year after LAGBP, LSG, and LRYGB. METHODS: The sample included 120 patients (40 patients [13 men/27 premenopausal women] each in LAGBP, LSG, and LRYGB groups). The mean preoperative age and body mass index were 30.0±6.5 years and 39.5±3.8 kg/m2, respectively. BMD was measured using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry at the lumbar anteroposterior spine and total hip preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. RESULTS: The mean percentage of excess weight loss was 61.9%±16.8%, 77.1%±12.3%, and 72.7%±17.4% at 1 year after LAGBP, LSG, and LRYGB, respectively. The mean BMD at the lumbar anteroposterior spine remained unchanged in the LSG and LRYGB groups, but significantly increased in the LAGBP group. The mean BMD at the total hip significantly decreased in all groups compared to the preoperative values. However, the mean BMD was significantly higher in the LRYGB than in the LAGBP group. CONCLUSION: Bone loss at the hips was observed in all patients, including those with adequate micronutrient supplementation. LRYGB caused significantly greater bone loss than the other procedures.",
