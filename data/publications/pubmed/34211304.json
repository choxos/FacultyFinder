  "title": "Do Generic Preference-Based Measures Accurately Capture Areas of Health-Related Quality of Life Important to Individuals with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Content Validation Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objectives of this study were to 1) assess the content validity of generic preference-based measures (GPBMs), and (2) examine the convergent validity of the EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L), against the Patient Generated Index (PGI) in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: Participants were recruited from 3 clinical sites across Canada. The PGI, EQ-5D-5L and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) were administered through an online or hardcopy survey and scores compared for convergent validation. Domains nominated by participants as important to their health-related quality of life were generated using the PGI, classified using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and mapped onto GPBMs to determine content coverage. RESULTS: Fifty-two participants (N=28 female; 61.3 ± 11.6 mean age ± standard deviation (SD); 3.5 ± 2.9 mean ± SD years since diagnosis) completed this study. The top three ICF domains identified by participants were recreation and leisure, lower limb mobility, and interpersonal relationships. The Quality of Well-Being Self-Administered (QWB-SA) scale had the highest content coverage (87%) and the Health Utilities Index 3 (HUI3) had the lowest (33%). Two domains were covered by all GPBMs and no GPBM included all domains identified as important by participants. A moderate correlation coefficient of 0.52 between the PGI and EQ-5D-5L was found. CONCLUSION: The majority of GPBMs covered only approximately half of the domains important to individuals with ALS suggesting the need for an ALS specific preference-based measure to better reflect the health-related quality of life of this population.",
