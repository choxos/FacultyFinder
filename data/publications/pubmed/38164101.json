  "title": "Oxygen Saturation Targets in Infants Hospitalized With Bronchiolitis: A Multicenter Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To examine 2 hospital oxygen saturation target policies and clinical outcomes in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis. METHODS: This multicenter cohort study used data collected from a randomized clinical trial of infants aged 4 weeks to 24 months, hospitalized with bronchiolitis at children's and community hospitals from 2016 to 2019. We modeled the association between hospital oxygen saturation target policy, either 90% while awake and 88% while asleep (90%/88%) or 90% while awake and asleep (90%/90%), and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 162 infants were enrolled at 4 hospitals using a 90%/88% oxygen saturation target and 67 infants at 2 hospitals using a 90%/90% target policy. No significant differences between the 90%/88% group and 90%/90% groups were observed for time to discharge (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.14; P = .25), initiation of supplemental oxygen (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.98; 95% CI, 0.47-2.02; P = .95), time to discontinuation of supplemental oxygen (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.44-1.27; P = .28), revisits (aOR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.71; P = .52), and parent days missed from work (aOR, 2.41; 95% CI, 0.90-6.41; P = .08). Three infants in the 90%/88% group and none in the 90%/90% group were transferred to the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: Among infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, clinical outcomes were similar between a hospital oxygen saturation target policy of 90% while awake and 88% while asleep compared with 90% while awake and asleep. These findings may inform the design of future trials of oxygen saturation targets in bronchiolitis hospital care.",
