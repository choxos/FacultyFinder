  "title": "It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's a Vein: Jugular Vein Phlebectasia in a Pediatric Patient With Tracheomalacia.",
  "abstract": "Jugular vein phlebectasia is seen in the first decade of life and carries a high chance of misdiagnosis as it can often be mistaken for other conditions observed in pediatric populations. High clinical suspicion along with radiological studies can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually conservative, with surgery reserved for unique circumstances. This is the first case to be reported with concomitant tracheomalacia and a history of tracheoesophageal fistula repair in a pediatric patient with external jugular vein phlebectasia.",
