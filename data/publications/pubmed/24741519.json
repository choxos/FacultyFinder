  "abstract": "CONTEXT: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is one of the most common preventable causes of mental retardation in children and it occurs in approximately 1:2,000-1:4,000 newborns. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of CH in neonates. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This cross-sectional study was conducted in neonatal units of the Department of Pediatrics Unit-I, King Edward Medical University/Mayo Hospital, Lahore and Lady Willington Hospital Lahore in 6 months (January-June 2011). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sample was collected by non-probability purposive sampling. After consent, 550 newborn were registered for the study. Demographic data and relevant history was recorded. After aseptic measures, 2-3 ml venous blood analyzed for thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level by immunoradiometric assay. Treatment was started according to the individual merit as per protocol. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: Data was analyzed by SPSS 17 and Chi-square test was applied to find out the association of CH with different variables. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 550 newborns. Among 550 newborns, 4 (0.8%) newborns had elevated TSH level. CH had statistically significant association with mother's hypothyroidism (P value 0.000) and mother's drug intake during the pregnancy period (P value 0.013). CONCLUSION: CH is 0.8% in neonates. It has statistically significant association with mother's hypothyroidism and mother's drug intake during pregnancy.",
