  "title": "Quantifying patients' expectations prior to bariatric surgery with the BODY-Q in an international multicentre cohort.",
  "abstract": "Many people living with obesity may have unrealistic expectations prior to undergoing bariatric surgery. These expectations can lead to frustration, regret and even worse psychological outcomes after surgery. Prior to undergoing bariatric surgery, patients completed the BODY-Q Expectations scale. This 15-item scale asks patients to imagine what their life will be like when 2 years have passed since bariatric surgery. Scores for expectations range from 0 (low) to 100 (high). Linear regression models were used to assess which of the patient characteristics could predict patients' expectations. From 2019 to 2020, a total of 333 patients were recruited from three different countries. The mean score on the BODY-Q Expectations scale was 73.1, ±20. Out of the 15 items on the Expectation scale, people living with obesity found it most likely that bariatric surgery would make them feel better and improve their energy, while it was reported least likely that they would look good without clothes on. Younger age (p = <.01) and race (non-white) (p = .046) were found to be significant predictors for higher scores on the Expectations scale. Participants who identified as non-white from the Netherlands and United States, and those aged under 40 years reported higher expectations compared with participants who identified as white race and were 40 years of age or older. Prior to bariatric surgery, patients aged under 40 years and those who identified as non-white for race had higher expectations that their life would change after bariatric surgery. These relevant findings should be considered when giving pre-operative counselling.",
