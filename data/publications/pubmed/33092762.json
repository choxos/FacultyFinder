  "title": "Tine-Based Leadless Pacemaker: Strategies for Safe Implantation in Unconventional Clinical Scenarios.",
  "abstract": "Leadless pacemakers (LPs) have emerged as a meaningful alternative to transvenous pacemakers for single-ventricular pacing. LPs eliminate many of lead- and pocket-associated complications observed with transvenous pacemakers. Owing to the lack of atrioventricular synchronous pacing until recently, the use of LP was generally reserved for those patients who either required minimal ventricular pacing or had permanent atrial fibrillation. The only commercially available LP is the Micra transcatheter pacing system (Micra-TPS, Medtronic Inc. Fridley, Minnesota), which requires insertion of a 27-F (outer diameter) introducer sheath in the femoral vein. The LP is delivered to the right ventricle using a 23-F delivery catheter. Owing to the need for a large-bore sheath, the pivotal studies for the Micra transcatheter pacing system excluded patients with indwelling inferior vena cava filters and included only a few patients with bioprosthetic or repaired tricuspid valve. Subsequent real-world experience has demonstrated the overall safety and feasibility of LP placement, and use in various unconventional clinical settings has been validated, albeit with specific precautions. Additionally, incorporation of adjunctive techniques and strategies can improve the safety of the procedure in routine clinical settings as well. The objective of this state-of-the-art review is to highlight the key procedural elements to facilitate safe and efficient implantation of LP in routine as well as in unique clinical settings.",
