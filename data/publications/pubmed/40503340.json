  "title": "Virtual physiological analysis of non-culprit disease in patients with STEMI and multivessel disease: a substudy of the COMPLETE trial.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: In the complete revascularization with multivessel PCI for myocardial infarction (COMPLETE) trial, staged complete revascularization in patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) reduced major adverse cardiovascular events compared with culprit-only revascularization. Inclusion was based on angiographic criteria. OBJECTIVES: We modelled non-culprit virtual fractional flow reserve (vFFR) and investigated interactions between physiological lesion severity and the benefits of complete revascularization in COMPLETE. METHODS AND RESULTS: All suitable angiograms from COMPLETE underwent software-based 3-dimensional (3D) arterial reconstruction and analysis of 3D-quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and vFFR using computational fluid dynamics software. Physiological lesion significance was defined as vFFR ≤0.80 and was compared with operators' visual angiographic analysis, 2D-QCA and 3D-QCA. vFFR was computed in 635 patients (710 lesions). 302 patients (48%) had ≥1 physiologically significant lesion and 333 (52%) had none. 321 (45%) lesions were physiologically significant and 389 (55%) were not. There was no statistically significant interaction between physiological lesion significance and any of the trial co-primary or key secondary clinical outcomes, or an exploratory outcome of ischaemia-driven revascularization without preceding MI (all interaction P > 0.30). 3D-QCA predicted vFFR significance more accurately than visual and 2D-QCA (concordance 73% vs. 49% vs. 59%, respectively). CONCLUSION: In this virtual physiological substudy of the COMPLETE trial, 52% of patients lacked any physiologically significant lesions and the benefits of complete revascularization appeared to be independent of physiological lesion significance. 3D-QCA was a better predictor of physiological significance than either 2D-QCA or operator visual analysis. Further research is warranted to compare angiography-guided and physiology-guided complete revascularization strategies.",
