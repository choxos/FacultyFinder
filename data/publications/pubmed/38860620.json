  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic mental health condition that results in significant individual and societal burden. Cognitive-behaviour therapy (CBT) therapy is an effective treatment for GAD, however, many individuals experience logistical barriers when accessing evidence-based care. Remote treatments may help to reduce these barriers, however, currently, there are few studies examining the efficacy of high-intensity remote methods for GAD treatment. The current study aims to examine the efficacy of CBT delivered via videoconferencing (VCBT) for GAD using a randomized controlled trial design comparing an immediate treatment group to a waitlist control. METHOD: Seventy-eight adults (M age = 36.92; SD = 12.92; 84.4% female) with GAD were enrolled in the study. RESULTS: Those in the treatment group demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in GAD symptoms from pre-treatment to post-treatment (d = 1.03) and pre-treatment to 3-month follow-up (d = 1.50). Large between-group effect sizes were also observed at post-treatment (d = .80). Twenty-five participants (64.10%) in the VCBT group no longer met diagnostic criteria for GAD at post-treatment, and 26/39 (66.67%) no longer met criteria at 3-month follow-up. Ninety-six per cent of participants were satisfied with the treatment. CONCLUSION: The results contribute towards advancing our knowledge on the efficacy and acceptability of VCBT for patients with GAD.",
