  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, effectiveness and costs of a web-based follow-up compared to in-person assessment following primary total hip or total knee arthroplasty. Patients who were at least 12 months postoperative were randomized to follow-up method. We excluded patients who had revision surgery, osteolysis, complications or identified radiographic issues. 229 patients (118 Web, 111 in-person) completed the study. There were no patients who had an issue missed by the web-based follow-up. Patients in the web-based group travelled less (28.2km vs 103.7km, (P<0.01)), had lower associated costs ($10.45 vs $21.36, (P<0.01)) and took less time to complete (121.7min web vs 228.7min usual). Web-based follow-up is a feasible, clinically effective alternative with lower associated costs than in-person clinic assessment.",
