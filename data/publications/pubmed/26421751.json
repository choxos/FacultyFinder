  "title": "OSCE circuit performance effects: Does circuit order influence scores?",
  "abstract": "It is not uncommon for medical students to raise concerns over the difficulty of a single station within an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), particularly when they feel they were subject to an unfair situation. Indeed, test developers also share these concerns about the possibility that a single extremely difficult station may impact student performance on the station that follows. As a reaction to the concerns of both students and examiners, we conducted a study, analyzing the scores of multiple OSCEs. Although our analyses did not support the complaints of unfairness targeted at the OSCE, we feel it is a rather enlightening story nevertheless, and one worth sharing.",
