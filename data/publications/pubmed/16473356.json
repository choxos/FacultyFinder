  "title": "Conducting industry-partnered trials in orthopaedic surgery.",
  "abstract": "We have seen an emergence of larger scale collaborative multi-center trials in surgery. These larger trials have the advantage of increased generalisability of the results and the potential for large scale and efficient recruitment (1000 patients or more). It is estimated that the average cost of bringing a new drug to market approximates 500 million dollars. The funding limitations in most national peer-reviewed agencies provides a compelling rationale for industry co-sponsors. To limit biases associated with industry-sponsored research, researchers should develop specific protocols to ensure accurate and transparent reporting of funding sources, design and implementation of surgical trials, manuscript preparation and the criteria for authorship.",
