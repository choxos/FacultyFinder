  "title": "Prenatal exposure to glufosinate ammonium disturbs gut microbiome and induces behavioral abnormalities in mice.",
  "abstract": "Glufosinate ammonium (GLA) is a widely used organophosphate herbicide, which could be commonly detected in body fluids of both pregnant women and newborns. Existing evidences indicate that GLA has reproductive toxicity, while data concerning the effects of prenatal GLA exposure on neurodevelopment is rather limited. Here we employed a mouse model exposed to GLA prenatally. Reduced locomotor activity, impaired memory formation and autism-like behaviors were observed in the treatment group. Marked alteration in gut microbiome of the treatment offspring mice could be found at 4th week, and seemed to recover over time. Fecal metabolomics analysis indicated remarkable changes in microbiome-related metabolism in the treatment group, which could be the cause of behavioral abnormality in mice. Present study suggested that prenatal exposure to GLA disturbed gut microbiome and metabolism, and thereby induced behavioral abnormalities in mice.",
