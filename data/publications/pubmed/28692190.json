  "title": "Dupuytren's contracture and handwork: A case-control study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the association between Dupuytren's contracture (DC), repetitive handwork (RHW), heavy handwork (HHW), and/or vibration exposure. METHODS: Frequency and intensity of the three types of handwork were collected and compared between DC patients and controls. Hours of work were weighted by average \"frequency,\" for RHW, and average \"intensity,\" for HHW and use of vibrating tool. Logistic regression was used to evaluate risk of developing DC associated with the above-mentioned factors. RESULTS: Data from 129 cases (74 clinical, 106 controls) was analyzed. Family history, male gender and age (decades) were associated with increased risk of DC. Results indicate that the risk becomes substantial after about 30 years of steady RHW. Independent effects of intensity-weighted HHW and vibrating exposure were not established. CONCLUSIONS: Frequency-weighted RHW increases DC risk. Additionally, a strong association between DC, male gender and heredity was found.",
