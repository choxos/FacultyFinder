  "title": "A Challenging Case of Managing Septic Arthritis of the Sternoclavicular Joint in a Patient With a History of Intravenous Opioid Use Disorder: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
  "abstract": "Septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint (SCJ) is a rare condition with limited literature available. We present a case of a 31-year-old female patient with a history of opioid drug use who presented with septic arthritis of the left SCJ. The patient exhibited chest wall pain; imaging revealed septic arthritis with an associated retrosternal abscess. Treatment with antibiotics alone resulted in the resolution of the abscess, highlighting the potential for medical management without surgical intervention. This case report and literature review emphasizes the importance of considering septic arthritis in patients with vague chest pain, particularly those with a history of intravenous drug use, and raise awareness about the complications associated with opioid use.",
