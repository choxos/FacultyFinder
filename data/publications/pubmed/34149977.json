  "abstract": "Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rhinorrhea is rare and may develop secondary to inner ear malformation. A possible diagnosis of CSF leak should be considered in any pediatric patient who presents with hearing impairment, rhinorrhea, or otorrhea. Temporal bone computed tomography should be performed in children with hearing impairments. We describe a case of congenital inner ear anomaly in a 12-month-old girl who presented with intermittent rhinorrhea after birth and detected hearing problems when she was 6 months. After diagnosis, the CSF leak was surgically repaired without complications.",
