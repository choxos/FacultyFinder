  "title": "Rosinidin Protects Streptozotocin-Induced Memory Impairment-Activated Neurotoxicity by Suppressing Oxidative Stress and Inflammatory Mediators in Rats.",
  "abstract": "Background and Objectives: To assess the antioxidant and neuroprotective role of rosinidin on rat memory impairment that is induced by streptozotocin. Materials and Methods: Wistar rats were given an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) followed by treatment with rosinidin at selective doses (10 and 20 mg/kg) for 30 days. The behavioral parameters were estimated by Y-maze test and Morris water test. Biochemical parameters such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline aacetyltransferase (ChAT), and nitric oxide, and antioxidants such as glutathione transferase (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) IL-6, IL-10, Nrf2, and BDNF, were determined. Results: The study results revealed that rosinidin improved cognition by reverting the behavioral parameters. The treatment with rosinidin restored the antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: From the results, it has been proven that rosinidin possesses antioxidant, anti-amnesic, and anti-inflammatory activity. Rosinidin improved the cognitive and behavioral deficits that were induced by streptozotocin. Furthermore, 20 mg/kg rosinidin was found to have strong protective action against streptozotocin-induced toxicity.",
