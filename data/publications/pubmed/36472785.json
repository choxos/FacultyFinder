  "title": "Effective Management Options for Treatment of Microinstability of the Hip: a Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review the recent literature identifying and summarizing the research involving management of microinstability of the hip and highlight new and evolving techniques in its treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent updates in the understanding of capsular management hip arthroscopy will likely lead to less revision surgery and a decreased incidence of persistent post-operative pain. Repair of residual capsular defects has shown good outcomes with high patient satisfaction. Capsular plication remains the gold standard for hips with increased pain that show signs of capsular laxity/deficiency on exam or imaging. Capsular reconstruction has shown equivalent results to other revision hip arthroscopy procedures with low rates of complications. Ligamentum teres pathology, although rare, should be considered a source of pain, particularly in patients with laxity on exam. In cases where CAM over-resection has occurred, remplissage using allograft is an effective option for restoring the capsular suction seal and stability. Microinstability is increasingly being recognized as a source of post-operative hip pain. Patients with collagen disorders remain a challenging clinical entity with increased rates of complications and post-operative pain. CAM resection should be performed carefully and not disrupt the suction seal but be sufficient to not cause further impingement. Improved evidence including well-designed prospective studies with large sample sizes will determine the future management of this complex problem.",
