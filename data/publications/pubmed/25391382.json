  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a lack of knowledge about antidementia drug treatment in community dwelling people with dementia in Germany. OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of treatment with antidementia drugs in patients in primary care, and the socio-demographic and clinical variables associated with antidementia drug treatment. METHODS: Present analyses are based on preliminary data from the DelpHi-trial, an ongoing GP-based, cluster-randomized, controlled intervention trial to implement and evaluate an innovative concept of collaborative dementia care management in Germany. Our sample consists of n = 243 subjects who screened positive for dementia. RESULTS: 29.6% (n = 72) of participants received antidementia drugs: memantine 44.5% (n = 32); donepezil 30.5% (n = 22); rivastigmine 13.9% (n = 10); galantamine 11.1% (n = 8). A total of 46.4% (n = 45) of the subgroup of participants with a formal dementia diagnosis received antidementia drug treatment. Approximately 37.5% (n = 27) of our sample received treatment with antidementia drugs without having a formal diagnosis. Treatment with antidementia drugs was significantly associated with more severe cognitive impairment and having a formal dementia diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: One in three people who screened positive for dementia in primary care received antidementia drug treatment, indicating the frequent use of this class of drugs. For those with a formal dementia diagnosis, these drug treatment rates are more than triple, compared to those in nursing homes.",
