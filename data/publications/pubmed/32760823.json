  "abstract": "Dichapetalum crassifolium Chodat (Dichapetalaceae) is widely distributed in Africa, Tropical Asia and Latin America. As part of our quest for potential bioactive lead compounds for various neglected tropical diseases, we report the anti-schistosomal potential of the crude extracts and chemical constituents of the stems and roots of Dichapetalum crassifolium. Column chromatography of extracts of the stems and roots led to the isolation and identification of three oleanane-type triterpenoids, friedelan-3β-ol (1), friedelan-3-one (2), and maslinic acid (3); the ursane-type tritepenoid, pomolic acid (4) and the dammarane-type tetracyclic triterpenoids, dichapetalin A (5) and dichapetalin M (6). Dichapetalin A was isolated from only the roots. Isolated compounds were identified by comparison of their physico-chemical and spectral data with published data. The highest in vitro anti-schistosomal activity (IC50) of the crude extracts against clinical isolates of Schistosoma haematobium (Bilharz 1852) was 248.6 μg/ml for the ethyl acetate extract of the root while dichapetalin A gave the highest activity at 151.1 μg/ml among the compounds compared with the 15.5 μg/ml for the standard drug, praziquantel. The rest of the compounds showed activities in the order 177.9, 191.0, and 378.1 μg/ml respectively for mixture of β-sitosterol/stigmasterol, dichapetalin M and friedelan-3-one. The least active extract was the methanol extract of the stem (893.7 μg/ml). The constituents of D. crassifolium showed activity against the S. haematobium that are below praziquantel. It is envisaged that the presence of multiple layers and the minute sizes of pores in the egg shells, may preclude penetration of eggs by the compounds.",
