  "title": "Application-Based Early Interventions of Hardware-Related Infection After Invasive Neuromodulation Prevent Implant Removal.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to establish a mobile health application to diagnose and treat postdischarge hardware-related infections in a timely manner and prevent the complete removal of hardware or an implantable pulse generator (IPG). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective and historical controlled study of all patients who had undergone initial hardware implantation at a single center. All participants were aggregated into 2 groups, A (between June 2005 and June 2014) and B (between July 2014 and May 2020). In group B, the Postdischarge Patient Aide was used for wound monitoring. Both groups received regular clinical follow-up. Cases and the range of hardware-related infections were compared. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in infection rate between the groups (1.8% vs. 1.4%, PÂ = 0.413). After application of the Postdischarge Patient Aide, the proportion of patients with early interventions had increased significantly in group B compared with group A (83.3% vs. 20.0%, P < 0.001). The percentage of patients with IPG infection at the time of interventions in group B was significantly lower than that in group A (8.3% vs. 60.0%, P < 0.001). The IPG preservation rate in group B was significantly higher than that in group A (75% vs. 16%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A mobile health application provides an efficient way to make an early diagnosis, treat a hardware-related infection, and prevent hardware removal. Information on wound healing should be transmitted to the surgery team in a convenient and fast way to prevent infection spreading, which helps to prevent the IPG from being abandoned.",
