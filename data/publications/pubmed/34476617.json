  "title": "Reducing unnecessary fixation of midshaft clavicle fractures.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Displaced midshaft clavicle fractures have a non-union rate of 10-20%. Those who unite with conservative treatment have similar outcomes to those who undergo operative treatment; therefore, protocols to identify potential non-unions are important to avoid unnecessary surgery. The aim of this study is to report one such protocol. METHODS: A protocol was introduced, where all isolated closed displaced midshaft clavicle fractures were initially managed non-operatively in a sling. At 2Â weeks patients were assessed clinically and those who were struggling with their symptoms were offered surgery, with the remainder mobilised as comfortable. All cases treated at one centre over a three-year period, with a minimum follow-up of one-year underwent case note review. RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017 613 clavicle fractures were managed through clinic. 347 were middle third (56%), 75% were male, mean age 41(range16-97). Forty-one middle third clavicle fracture patients underwent early fixation. Eleven patients required late fixation for symptomatic delayed, non- or malunion, 6 for symptomatic non-unions and 1 was a symptomatic malunion. For displaced fractures the early operative rate was 17.8%, and symptomatic non/malunion rate was 3.2%. This led to a total operative rate of 21%. CONCLUSION: A protocol for managing clavicle fractures has demonstrated an effective management of these injuries. It is cost-effective reducing the number of patients with displaced fractures requiring fixation with a fixation rate of 21% whilst reducing the rate of symptomatic non- and malunion (3.2%). The management pathway is simple and could be introduced into any orthopaedic outpatient department with ease.",
