  "title": "From LncRNA to metastasis: The MALAT1-EMT axis in cancer progression.",
  "abstract": "Cancer is a complex disease that causes abnormal genetic changes and unchecked cellular growth. It also causes a disruption in the normal regulatory processes that leads to the creation of malignant tissue. The complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and epigenetic variables influences its etiology. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal contributors within the intricate landscape of cancer biology, orchestrating an array of multifaceted cellular processes that substantiate the processes of carcinogenesis and metastasis. Metastasis is a crucial driver of cancer mortality. Among these, MALAT1 (Metastasis-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) has drawn a lot of interest for its function in encouraging metastasis via controlling the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) procedure. MALAT1 exerts a pivotal influence on the process of EMT, thereby promoting metastasis to distant organs. The mechanistic underpinning of this phenomenon involves the orchestration of an intricate regulatory network encompassing transcription factors, signalling cascades, and genes intricately associated with the EMT process by MALAT1. Its crucial function in transforming tumor cells into an aggressive phenotype is highlighted by its capacity to influence the expression of essential EMT effectors such as N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Snail. An understanding of the MALAT1-EMT axis provides potential therapeutic approaches for cancer intervention. Targeting MALAT1 or its downstream EMT effectors may reduce the spread of metastatic disease and improve the effectiveness of already available therapies. Understanding the MALAT1-EMT axis holds significant clinical implications. Therefore, directing attention towards MALAT1 or its downstream mediators could present innovative therapeutic strategies for mitigating metastasis and improving patient prognosis. This study highlights the importance of MALAT1 in cancer biology and its potential for cutting back on metastatic disease with novel treatment strategies.",
