  "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the effects of cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) gene polymorphism and drug interaction on the metabolism of blonanserin. Human recombinant CYP3A4 was prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system. A microsomal enzyme reaction system was established, and drug-drug interactions were evaluated using Sprague-Dawley rats. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to detect the concentrations of blonanserin and its metabolite. Compared with wild type CYP34A, the relative clearance of blonanserin by CYP3A4.29 significantly increased to 251.3%, while it decreased notably with CYP3A4.4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 23, 24, 28, 31, 33, and 34, ranging from 6.09% to 63.34%. Among 153 tested drugs, nimodipine, felodipine, and amlodipine were found to potently inhibit the metabolism of blonanserin. Moreover, the inhibitory potency of nimodipine, felodipine, and amlodipine varied with different CYP3A4 variants. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration and enzymatic kinetics assay demonstrated that the metabolism of blonanserin was noncompetitively inhibited by nimodipine in rat liver microsomes and was inhibited in a mixed manner by felodipine and amlodipine in both rat liver microsomes and human liver microsomes. When nimodipine and felodipine were coadministered with blonanserin, the area under the blood concentration-time curve (AUC)(0-t), AUC(0-âˆž), and C max of blonanserin increased. When amlodipine and blonanserin were combined, the C max of blonanserin C increased remarkably. The vast majority of CYP3A4 variants have a low ability to catalyze blonanserin. With combined administration of nimodipine, felodipine, and amlodipine, the elimination of blonanserin was inhibited. This study provides the basis for individualized clinical use of blonanserin. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The enzyme kinetics of novel CYP3A4 enzymes for metabolizing blonanserin were investigated. Clearance of blonanserin by CYP3A4.4, 5, 7-10, 12-14, 16-18, 23-24, 28, 31, 33, and 34 decreased notably, but increased with CYP3A4.29. Additionally, we established a drug interaction spectrum for blonanserin, in which nimodipine, felodipine, and amlodipine kinetics exhibited mixed inhibition. Moreover, their inhibitory potencies decreased with CYP3A4.4 and 5 compared to CYP3A4.1. This study provides essential data for personalized clinical use of blonanserin.",
