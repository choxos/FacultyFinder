  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of osteoporosis in osteoarthritic patients undergoing total hip or total knee arthroplasty. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: The Specialized Outpatient Rehabilitation Service's (SORS) Pre-surgical Arthroplasty Service located at the Chedoke Hospital, Hamilton Health Sciences, Hamilton, ON, Canada. PARTICIPANTS: SORS outpatients (N=364), from the period of March 2006 to March 2007. INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of osteoporosis was determined by review of a self-reported survey, and defined by (1) self-reported diagnosis of osteoporosis, (2) history of fragility fracture (defined by a bone fracture occurring as a result of a fall from standing height or less after the age of 50), or (3) current treatment for osteoporosis using bisphosphonates. RESULTS: Of the study cohort, 26% were classified as having osteoporosis, according to our criteria. Of the patients with self-reported osteoporosis or a history of fragility fractures, only 37% and 17% reported current treatment with bisphosphonates, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoporosis is common in the osteoarthritic arthroplasty population, with a prevalence at least equal to that in the general population. Due to the self-reported nature of the study, the prevalence of osteoporosis in this population is likely significantly higher. Results from this study indicate need for further research, specifically in formal assessment for osteoporosis in patients undergoing a joint replacement.",
