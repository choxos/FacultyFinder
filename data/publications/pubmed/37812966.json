  "title": "Bed flow priorities and the spatial and temporal dimensions of rural older adult care.",
  "abstract": "Despite prior research that examines the spatial and temporal dimensions of older adult care, there is disparate research on the influence of patient flow priorities on older adult care over time and place. Drawing on a qualitative case study of rural older adult transitions in care in the Canadian context we examine how patient flow prioritization undervalues older patients' needs and the local contexts in which care is provided. Certainly, accounting for the spatial and temporal dimensions of older adult care has broader implications that will enhance future research, policy and practice. Policy makers, researchers and clinicians may then use these recommendations as a stepping stone to align the health care system with the older populations that they serve.",
