  "abstract": "Children and adolescents with a bipolar disorder experience mood dysregulation that is often chronic with little interepisodic recovery. Although bipolar disorder in youth is recognized by more and more clinicians, much is still not known regarding how best to accurately diagnose and effectively treat it. As a result, children and adolescents with bipolar disorder are often symptomatic for long periods of time before receiving appropriate treatment. In this review of the pediatric bipolar disorder literature, the phenomenology, longitudinal course, and risk factors associated with the illness' development are discussed. Also, recent research pertaining to neuroimaging and pharmacologic and psychological treatments are considered. Because pediatric bipolar disorder is such a pernicious condition, it is recommended that clinicians complete a careful assessment of mood symptoms and comorbid conditions when this illness is suspected so that they can provide treatments with the best chance of benefit in a timely manner.",
