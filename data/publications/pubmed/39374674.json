  "abstract": "Plants require nutrients for growth, which they obtain from the soil via the root system. Fertilizers offer the essential nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, as well as critical secondary elements) required by plants. Soil productivity falls with each crop until nutrients are provided. A wide range of so-called fertilizer products, such as organic fertilizers, argon mineral fertilizers, and mineral fertilizers, can assist farmers in adjusting fertilization methods based on the environment and agricultural conditions (inhibitors, restricted materials, growth mediums, plant bio-stimulants, etc.). Agricultural land is reduced by erosion, pollution, careless irrigation, and fertilization. On the other hand, more agricultural production is needed to meet the demands of expanding industries and the nutritional needs of a growing population. Nano fertilizers have recently started to be manufactured to obtain the highest yield and its quality per unit area. Previous researchers found that nano fertilizers could improve plant nutrient uptake efficiency, lower soil toxicity, mitigate the potential negative effects of excessive chemical fertilizer use, and reduce the frequency of fertilization. To maximize crop yields and optimize nutrient use while reducing the overuse of chemical fertilizers, nano fertilizersNFs are crucial in agriculture. The key component of these fertilizers is that they contain one or more macro- and micronutrients that can be applied regularly in minute doses while not damaging the environment. However, they have a minimal effect on plant growth and agricultural yields when employed in high numbers, like synthetic fertilizers. This article explains the features, relevance and classification of nano-fertilizers, their use in plant development, their advantages and disadvantages, and the results achieved in this field.",
