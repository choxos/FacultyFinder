  "title": "Autophagy-associated non-coding RNAs: Unraveling their impact on Parkinson's disease pathogenesis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition marked by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The precise etiology of PD remains unclear, but emerging evidence suggests a significant role for disrupted autophagy-a crucial cellular process for maintaining protein and organelle integrity. METHODS: This review focuses on the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in modulating autophagy in PD. We conducted a comprehensive review of recent studies to explore how ncRNAs influence autophagy and contribute to PD pathophysiology. Special attention was given to the examination of ncRNAs' regulatory impacts in various PD models and patient samples. RESULTS: Findings reveal that ncRNAs are pivotal in regulating key processes associated with PD progression, including autophagy, Î±-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Dysregulation of specific ncRNAs appears to be closely linked to these pathogenic processes. CONCLUSION: ncRNAs hold significant therapeutic potential for addressing autophagy-related mechanisms in PD. The review highlights innovative therapeutic strategies targeting autophagy-related ncRNAs and discusses the challenges and prospective directions for developing ncRNA-based therapies in clinical practice. The insights from this study underline the importance of ncRNAs in the molecular landscape of PD and their potential in novel treatment approaches.",
