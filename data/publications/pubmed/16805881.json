  "title": "The International Quotidian Dialysis Registry: annual report 2006.",
  "abstract": "Interest in short daily and nocturnal hemodialysis (HD) regimens continues to grow worldwide. Despite growing optimism that these therapies will afford better patient outcomes over conventional HD, the current literature has not been viewed as sufficiently compelling to affect widespread implementation in most jurisdictions. Before these therapies can gain wider acceptance, larger and more rigorous studies will likely be needed. In June 2004, the Quotidian Dialysis Registry, based at the Lawson Health Research Institute at the University of Western Ontario, Canada, began recruiting patients across North America. By using an Internet-based data entry platform, patients from various centers worldwide will eventually be recruited, and studied prospectively. This paper constitutes the second annual update on patient and center recruitment, patient and treatment characteristics, and future directions for the registry.",
