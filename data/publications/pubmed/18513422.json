  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Emergency admissions may account for over 50% of surgical admissions. The impact on service provision and implications for training are difficult to quantify. We performed a cohort study to analyse these workload patterns. METHODS: Data on emergency room (ER) surgical admissions over six months was collected including patient demographics, referral sources, diagnosis, operation and length of stay and analysed according to sub-speciality and age-groups. RESULTS: There were 1392 (median age 41 (IQR 28-60) years, M:F = 1.7:1) emergency surgical admissions over six months; 45% were under 40 years of age and 48% patients self-referred to the ER. The commonest diagnoses were abscesses (11%), non-specific abdominal pain (9.7%) and neuro-trauma (9.6%). The median length of stay was 4 (IQR 2-8) days; with older (>80 years) patient staying significantly longer than those <40 years of age (median 8 vs 2 two days, P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). Vascular patients remained in hospital longer than trauma or general surgery patients (median 14 vs 3 days, P < 0.0001, Kruskal-Wallis test). A high proportion (43.5%) of the patients required operative intervention and service implications of various diagnoses and operative interventions are highlighted. CONCLUSION: With the introduction of shortened training period in Europe and World over, trainees may benefit from increased exposure to trauma and surgical emergencies. Resource planning should be based on more comprehensive, prospective data such as these.",
