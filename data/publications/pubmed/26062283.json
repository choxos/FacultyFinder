  "title": "Articaine hydrochloride: is it the solution?",
  "abstract": "In recent times there has been raised interest regarding the use of articaine hydrochloride as a dental local anaesthetic solution. The use of articaine hydrochloride as a dental local anaesthetic agent has been reported to be safe and effective. Paraesthesia is a rare but unwanted adverse effect attributed to the use of this local anaesthetic in dentistry, particularly following the administration of a nerve block injection. There is no evidence to support the opinion that the use of articaine carries a greater associated risk of paraesthesia than with the use of any other local anaesthetic. Clinical Relevance: The aim of this article is to review the relative merits of articaine hydrochloride against its documented potential drawbacks. The article will also aim to update readers on the use of articaine hydrochloride for local analgesia in dentistry, including the pharmacology, efficacy and safety concerns (including the risks of nerve paraesthesia) commonly associated with the administration of this agent.",
