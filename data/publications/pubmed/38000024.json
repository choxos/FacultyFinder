  "abstract": "Diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) attenuate diacylglycerol (DAG) signaling by converting DAG to phosphatidic acid, thereby suppressing pathways downstream of T cell receptor signaling. Using a dual DGKα/ζ inhibitor (DGKi), tumor-specific CD8 T cells with different affinities (TRP1[high] and TRP1[low]), and altered peptide ligands, we demonstrate that inhibition of DGKα/ζ can lower the signaling threshold for T cell priming. TRP1[high] and TRP1[low] CD8 T cells produced more effector cytokines in the presence of cognate antigen and DGKi. Effector TRP1[high]- and TRP1[low]-mediated cytolysis of tumor cells with low antigen load required antigen recognition, was mediated by interferon-γ, and augmented by DGKi. Adoptive T cell transfer into mice bearing pancreatic or melanoma tumors synergized with single-agent DGKi or DGKi and antiprogrammed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), with increased expansion of low-affinity T cells and increased cytokine production observed in tumors of treated mice. Collectively, our findings highlight DGKα/ζ as therapeutic targets for augmenting tumor-specific CD8 T cell function.",
