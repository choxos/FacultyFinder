  "title": "American Society of Hematology living guidelines on use of anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19: executive summary.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: COVID-19-related critical and acute illness is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). These evidence-based recommendations of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in decisions about using anticoagulation for thromboprophylaxis for patients with COVID-19-related critical illness; patients with COVID-19-related acute illness; and those being discharged from the hospital, who do not have suspected or confirmed VTE. METHODS: ASH formed a multidisciplinary panel, including patient representatives. The Michael G. DeGroote Cochrane Canada and MacGRADE Centres at McMaster University supported guideline development, including performing systematic reviews (up to June 2023). The panel prioritized clinical questions and outcomes according to their importance for clinicians and patients. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess certainty in the evidence and make recommendations. RESULTS: This is an executive summary of 3 updated recommendations that have been published, which concludes the living phase of the guidelines. For patients with COVID-19-related critical illness, the panel issued conditional recommendations suggesting (a) prophylactic-intensity over therapeutic-intensity anticoagulation and (b) prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation. For patients with COVID-19-related acute illness, conditional recommendations were suggested (a) prophylactic-intensity over intermediate-intensity anticoagulation, and (b) therapeutic-intensity over prophylactic-intensity anticoagulation. The panel issued a conditional recommendation suggesting against the use of postdischarge anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These conditional recommendations were made based on low or very low certainty in the evidence, underscoring the need for additional, high-quality, randomized controlled trials for patients with COVID-19.",
