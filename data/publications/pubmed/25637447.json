  "title": "The Canadian Choosing Wisely campaign: the Canadian Hematology Society's top five tests and treatments.",
  "abstract": "Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC), a medical stewardship campaign, encourages dialogue between physicians and patients to promote high-quality decision-making. Medical societies develop lists of tests, treatments, and procedures that are unnecessary, reduce value, and may cause harm. The Canadian Hematology Society (CHS) elicited suggestions for CWC recommendations from its members and received 35 unique suggestions. A working group rated these based on their potential for harm, benefit, frequency of use and value. Twelve highly ranked items were subjected to systematic evidence review. The final items were included in the list if they were of sufficient evidence base and met pre-defined core principles. The CHS-CWC recommendations are: to avoid IVIG treatment for asymptomatic immune thrombocytopenia, not bridge warfarin in low-risk patients going for procedures, not perform thrombophilia testing in the workup of early pregnancy loss, avoid fine-needle aspiration in lymphoma diagnosis, and not transfuse red blood cells for an arbitrary hemoglobin threshold. Through implementation of these recommendations, physicians will reduce potential harm to patients and increase the value of health care.",
