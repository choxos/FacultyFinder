  "title": "Which adults aged 65 and older are at low-risk for cervical spine injuries after low-level falls?",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The population is aging and falls are a common reason for emergency department visits. Appropriate imaging in this population is important. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of cervical spine injury and identify factors associated with cervical spine injuries in adults ≥ 65 years after low-level falls. METHODS: This was a pre-specified sub-study of a prospective observational cohort study of intracranial bleeding in emergency patients ≥ 65 years presenting after low-level falls. The primary outcome was cervical spine injury. The risk factors of interest were Glasgow coma scale (GCS) < 15, head injury, neck pain, age, and frailty defined as Clinical Frailty Scale ≥ 5. Multivariable logistic regression was used to measure the strength of association between risk factors and cervical spine injury. A descriptive analysis of absence of significant risk factors was performed to determine patients who may not require imaging. RESULTS: There were 4308 adults ≥ 65 who sustained low-level falls with mean age of 82.0 (standard deviation ± 8.8) years and 1538 (35.7%) were male; 23 [0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.3-0.8%)] were diagnosed with cervical spine injuries. The adjusted odds ratios and 95% CIs were 1.3 (0.5-3.2) for GCS < 15, 5.3 (1.7-26.7) for head injury, 13.0 (5.7-31.2) for new neck pain, 1.4 (1.0-1.8) for 5-year increase in age, and 1.1 (0.4-2.9) for frailty. Head injury or neck pain identified all 23 cervical spine injuries. Management was a rigid collar in 19/23 (82.6%) patients and none had surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In emergency patients ≥ 65 years presenting after a low-level fall, head injury, neck pain, and older age were associated with the diagnosis of cervical spine injury. There were no cervical spine injuries in those without head injury or neck pain. Patients with no head injury or neck pain may not require cervical spine imaging.",
