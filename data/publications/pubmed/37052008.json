  "abstract": "Preventable morbidities are serious conditions that have the potential to cause serious harm or death of the patient. One of the preventable morbidities is Gossypiboma or involuntary leaving of surgical sponge inside the body. The implication for the patient and the surgeon is grave. Gossypiboma is preventable if guidance and safety recommendations are followed. The purpose of presenting this case series is to rekindle awareness of the phenomena of Gossypiboma, highlight the implications, and stress prevention. Data of patients presented in the Lahore General Hospital was collected, which includes their demographic, clinical features, and management outcome. Their age, gender, surgery conducted, onset of symptoms, and salvage procedure were noted. Five cases are included in this case series from which it was concluded that Gossypiboma is encountered most commonly after intra-abdominal operation. Women are at increased risk during obstetric and gynaecological operations, though both genders are affected.",
