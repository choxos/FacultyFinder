  "title": "Clinical outcomes of hypomethylating agents and venetoclax in newly diagnosed unfit and relapsed/refractory paediatric, adolescent and young adult acute myeloid leukaemia patients.",
  "abstract": "Venetoclax (VEN) combined with hypomethylating agents (HMA) decitabine or azacitidine is used for adult acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but its application in paediatric, adolescent and young adult (AYA) AML lacks prospective studies. We performed a retrospective chart review of paediatric and AYA AML patients treated with HMA + VEN at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Centre. Twenty-seven patients received 30 HMA + VEN treatment courses for relapsed/refractory (R/R, n = 21) or newly diagnosed (n = 9) AML due to ineligibility for intensive chemotherapy. The R/R cohort had high-risk cytomolecular genetic alterations and prior extensive treatments, with 50% (n = 9) of relapse patients (n = 18) having undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Venetoclax treatment using the 400 mg adult exposure-equivelant dosing (AED) had a median duration of 21 days (range 7-30 days). Grade 3-4 toxicities included neutropenia (90%), anaemia (64%), thrombocytopenia (64%) and febrile neutropenia (44%). The overall complete remission (CR)/CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi) rate was 73% (77% minimal residual disease [MRD] negativity <0.1%), with 60% undergoing HSCT. Among newly diagnosed patients (n = 9), 89% achieved CR/CRi (78% MRD negativity) and 78% proceeded to HSCT. The R/R cohort (n = 21) showed a 67% CR/CRi rate (71% MRD negativity), with 52% undergoing HSCT. These findings support the safety and efficacy of HMA + VEN in paediatric/AYA AML, indicating it as a viable option for patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Further studies are necessary to determine optimal venetoclax dosing, chemotherapy combinations and pharmacokinetics in this population.",
