  "title": "Solitary Fibrous Tumor of Internal Jugular Vein: An Extremely Rare Entity with Review of Literature.",
  "abstract": "Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is an unusual spindle cell neoplasm that commonly arises from pleura. In the last decade, multiple case reports have described its diverse occurrence in extrapleural locations involving almost every anatomic site. Intravascular SFT is extremely rare and has been reported in inferior vena cava and renal vein only, to the best of our knowledge. SFT of the internal jugular vein has never been reported. We present a case of a SFT arising from internal jugular vein with extraluminal exophytic component extending into supraclavicular fossa. It should also be considered as a differential diagnosis for neoplasm arising from the internal jugular vein.",
