  "title": "Exploring the effect of prenatal maternal stress on the microbiomes of mothers and infants: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "Prenatal maternal stress (PNMS)-characterized by exposure to stress, anxiety, depression, or intimate partner violence-has been linked to biological alterations in infants, including disruptions to their intestinal microbiota, which have long-term implications for children's developmental outcomes. Significant research has been done examining the effects of PNMS on the microbiome in animals, but less is known about these effects in human research. The current systematic review aimed to synthesize current findings on the association between PNMS and mother and infant microbiomes. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and Eric databases were searched through to February 2022. A total of eight studies (n = 2219 infants, 2202 mothers) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Findings provided promising evidence of the role that PNMS plays in altering the microbial composition, diversity, and gut immunity in mothers and infants. Notably, majority of included studies found that higher PNMS was linked to increases in genera from the phylum Proteobacteria. The factors influencing these effects are explored including nutrition, birth mode, and parenting behaviors. Potential interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of PNMS are discussed, along with recommendations for future studies with longitudinal designs to better understand the appropriate type and timing of interventions needed to promote \"healthy\" maternal and infant microbial functioning.",
