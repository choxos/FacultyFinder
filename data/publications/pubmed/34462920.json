  "title": "Babesia microti in a Canadian blood donor and lookback in a red blood cell recipient.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We describe the third documented case of autochthonous human babesiosis in Canada and the second in a Canadian blood donor. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Multiple laboratory investigations were carried out on the donor and the immunocompromised recipient of an associated, potentially infectious red blood cell product. RESULTS: The donor had not travelled except for outdoor exposure in south-eastern Manitoba, followed by illness and hospital admission. The donor had a notable parasitaemia, positive for Babesia microti using whole blood nucleic acid testing (NAT). The recipient was negative for B. microti by both serology and NAT. CONCLUSION: There was no evidence of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis.",
