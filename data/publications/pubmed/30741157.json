  "title": "Exploring Spatial Variation in Registration for Deceased Organ Donation in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "Deceased organ donor registration rates vary within Ontario. We conducted a spatial analysis to assess how organ donor registration rates are patterned across Ontario and whether efforts to increase registrations have been successful. Statistically significant and substantial spatial variation was apparent, with geographic clusters of higher- and lower-than-average registration rates. Province-wide, rates of organ donor registration have increased by 62% from 2011 (when the BeADonor.ca online portal was launched) to 2016. Examination of clusters can be used to plan targeted campaigns and ascertain why residents are more (or less) likely to register for deceased organ donation.",
