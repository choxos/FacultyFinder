  "title": "Impact of pre-operative abdominal MRI on survival for patients with resected pancreatic carcinoma: a population-based study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study determined the impact of pre-operative abdominal MRI on all-cause mortality for patients with resected PDAC. METHODS: All adult (â‰¥18 years) PDAC patients who underwent pancreatectomy between January 2011 and December 2022 in Ontario, Canada, were identified for this population-based cohort study (ICD-O-3 codes: C250, C251, C252, C253, C257, C258). Patient demographics, comorbidities, PDAC stage, medical and surgical management, and survival data were sourced from multiple linked provincial administrative databases at ICES. All-cause mortality was compared between patients with and without a pre-operative abdominal MRI after controlling for multiple covariates. FINDINGS: A cohort of 4579 patients consisted of 2432 men (53.1%) and 2147 women (46.9%) with a mean age of 65.2 years (standard deviation: 11.2 years); 2998 (65.5%) died while 1581 (34.5%) survived. Median follow-up duration post-resection was 22.4 months (interquartile range: 10.8-48.8 months), and median survival post-pancreatectomy was 25.9 months (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 24.8, 27.5). Patients who underwent a pre-operative abdominal MRI had a median survival of 33.1 months (95% CI: 30.7, 37.2) compared to 21.1 months (95% CI: 19.8, 22.6) for all others. A total of 2354/4579 (51.4%) patients underwent a pre-operative abdominal MRI, which was associated with a 17.2% (95% CI: 11.0, 23.1) decrease in the rate of all-cause mortality, with an adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of 0.828 (95% CI: 0.769, 0.890). INTERPRETATION: Pre-operative abdominal MRI was associated with improved overall survival for PDAC patients who underwent pancreatectomy, possibly due to better detection of liver metastases than CT.
