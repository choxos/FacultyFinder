  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Research-conducive environments are mandatory for planning, implementing and translating research findings into evidence-informed health policies. AIM: This study aimed at comprehensive situation analysis of health research institutions in the Region. METHODS: We collected data on: institutional characteristics, research scope, capacity building, ethics, governance and resources. RESULTS: We contacted 575 institutions, of which, 223 (38.8%) responded, indicating that they conducted population research (82%). Reported studies were mostly in medicine, public health and epidemiology, while reported capacity building mainly focused on scientific writing (20.6%), research proposal writing (18%) and quantitative research methods (17%). Most institutions reported having collaborating partners (82%) - predominantly national (77%). Sixty-four percent of institutions received their own funding, with 48% reporting always having access to national databases. CONCLUSION: Governments in the Eastern Mediterranean Region and international funding agencies are called upon to support health research production through increasing allocated support and capacity building in health research.",
