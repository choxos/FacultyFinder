  "title": "Growth and differentiation of secondary malpighian tubules in the cockroach, Periplaneta americana.",
  "abstract": "Four differentiated Malpighian tubules (primary tubules) extend from the junction of the midgut and hindgut in newly hatched Periplaneta americana. Secondary tubules begin to develop near the base of the primary tubules before hatching and successive nymphal molts. The newly initiated tubules undergo cell division and extensive elongation through the middle of the following intermolt period. During this time, the cells of the distal, middle, and lower middle tubule regions are surrounded by a cellular sheath, have few cytoplasmic processes extending along their basal surfaces, have a small or nonexistent lumen, and contain extremely dilated cisternae of endoplasmic reticulum. The cellular sheath differentiates into the muscle which coils around the mature tubule. Tubules which begin development toward the end of one intermolt period begin to undergo cytodifferentiation toward the end of the next intermolt period. By the middle of an additional intermolt period, the basal infoldings and microvilli of cells in the distal, middle, and lower middle regions have the conformations typical for those regions in differentiated tubules; granular concretions and stellate cells are present within the middle region of the tubule.",
