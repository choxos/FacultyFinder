  "abstract": "There is limited data regarding percutaneous ventricular support in chronic total occlusion angioplasty in terms of population, procedure, and outcomes. This is the largest report to date showing promising results in terms of technical and procedural success in this highly comorbid population. This study encourages more research in the area and its use in large volume and experienced centers.",
