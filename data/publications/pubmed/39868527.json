  "title": "In situ synthesis of a UIO-66-NH2@Ti3C2 composite for advanced electrochemical detection of acetaminophen.",
  "abstract": "Acetaminophen (AP) is a widely used analgesic and antipyretic drug, but its excessive use poses health risks and contributes to environmental contamination. In response to the need for rapid, accurate, and cost-effective detection methods, we developed a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical sensor for AP. The sensor was based on a composite of UIO-66-NH2 (UN) and an MXene (Ti3C2). UIO-66-NH2 was in situ synthesized onto the MXene via a one-step hydrothermal process with a varying MXene content, followed by calcination at 300 °C under an argon (Ar) flow. This treatment induced the formation of TiO2 on the MXene surface and increased the interlayer spacing, which enhanced its electrochemical performance. The resulting UN@Ti3C2-C electrode exhibited remarkable electrochemical activity due to the high surface area and excellent conductivity of the MXene. The fabricated sensor demonstrated a simple yet effective approach for the rapid and quantitative detection of AP, with a linear detection range of 0.032-160 μM and a low detection limit of 10 nM. Moreover, the sensor was successfully applied to detect AP in different water samples, validating its potential as a reliable and efficient tool for AP monitoring.",
