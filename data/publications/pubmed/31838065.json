  "title": "Comprehensive facts on dynamic antimicrobial properties of polysaccharides and biomolecules-silver nanoparticle conjugate.",
  "abstract": "Based on progress for the green synthesis of nanoparticle (NPs), the mushrooms have also been utilized extensively for the biogenic synthesis of NPs. In recent years, silver NPs have been fabricated using mushrooms. The antimicrobial drugs are efficient to control the infectious diseases, but due to widespread of drugs, microbes became resistant to drugs, which demands develop of new bioactive agents. The silver NPs have been recognized as efficient broad spectrum antimicrobial agents, which have been fabricated using polysaccharides from mushrooms as reducing and capping agent. This review focused on the comprehensive study that deals silver NPs polysaccharides from Pleurotus mushroom, their synthesis mechanism, action mechanism of silver NPs and their characterization using advanced techniques i.e., ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), dynamic light scattering, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and XRD. The Pleurotus mushroom showed promising efficiency for the biogenic synthesis of polysaccharidesâ€‘silver NPS and as-prepared NPs showed excellent antimicrobial activity.",
