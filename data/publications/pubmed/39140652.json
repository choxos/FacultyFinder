  "abstract": "The COVID-19 crisis rapidly introduced telemedicine as the predominate modality to deliver healthcare however this change has not received attention in primary care settings and the health-related impacts are unknown. The study's objective was to explore the effects of physician-led synchronous telemedicine compared to face-to-face care delivered in the primary care setting on healthcare system use and attributes of primary care as reported in recent studies. We performed a comprehensive literature search in five databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycInfo) and critical appraisal using the Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Of 6,247 studies identified, 157 studies underwent full text review, and 19 studies were included. Most studies were conducted in the U.S. (78.9%) and used video and telephone telemedicine (57.9%). An outcome-based qualitative description and narrative synthesis showed similar or fewer emergency department visits, hospital visits, and prescribing, and fewer diagnostic tests and imaging for telemedicine visits compared to face-to-face care. Our systematic review fills a gap in the literature on telemedicine in primary care settings however our results need to be interpreted cautiously given studies' susceptibility to selection bias, confounding, and limited applicability to other health systems and time periods.",
