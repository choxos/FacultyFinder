  "title": "Extemporaneous compounding confidence progression from undergraduate to practice: a pharmacy education perspective.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study examined how undergraduate students, graduate interns and registered pharmacists perceived their competence in extemporaneous compounding. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a self-administered survey and participants ranked how confident they felt about compounding certain products using a Likert's scale and free-text responses. KEY FINDINGS: Pharmacy students perceived to be as confident as the interns and pharmacists in preparing 'simple' products, such as solutions, suspensions, creams and ointments. A lack of frequent practice was related to poor confidence by all three groups. CONCLUSION: Integration of theoretical, legal and ethical and patient counselling aspects in extemporaneous compounding curriculum could enhance learning and outcomes.",
