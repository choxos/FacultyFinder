  "abstract": "Biologic treatment options for Crohn's disease (CD) are increasing and providers will need enhanced support in integrating these therapies into routine practice. Using phase 3 clinical trial programs in CD, we have previously built and validated clinical decision support tools for achieving clinical remission (CREM) with vedolizumab and ustekinumab in CD.[1-4] We now aim to develop a clinical decision support tool for infliximab in CD.",
