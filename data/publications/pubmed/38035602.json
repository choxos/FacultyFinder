  "title": "A modified Delphi consensus statement on patellar instability: part II.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: The aim of this study was to establish consensus statements on medial patellofemoral ligament (MPFL) reconstruction, anteromedialization tibial tubercle osteotomy, trochleoplasty, and rehabilitation and return to sporting activity in patients with patellar instability, using the modified Delphi process. METHODS: This was the second part of a study dealing with these aspects of management in these patients. As in part I, a total of 60 surgeons from 11 countries contributed to the development of consensus statements based on their expertise in this area. They were assigned to one of seven working groups defined by subtopics of interest. Consensus was defined as achieving between 80% and 89% agreement, strong consensus was defined as between 90% and 99% agreement, and 100% agreement was considered unanimous. RESULTS: Of 41 questions and statements on patellar instability, none achieved unanimous consensus, 19 achieved strong consensus, 15 achieved consensus, and seven did not achieve consensus. CONCLUSION: Most statements reached some degree of consensus, without any achieving unanimous consensus. There was no consensus on the use of anchors in MPFL reconstruction, and the order of fixation of the graft (patella first versus femur first). There was also no consensus on the indications for trochleoplasty or its effect on the viability of the cartilage after elevation of the osteochondral flap. There was also no consensus on postoperative immobilization or weightbearing, or whether paediatric patients should avoid an early return to sport.",
