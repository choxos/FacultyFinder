  "title": "Establishing an Evidence Synthesis Capability For Psychological Health Topics in the Military Health System.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To promote evidence-based health care, clinical providers and decision makers rely on scientific evidence to inform best practices. Evidence synthesis (ES) is a key component of this process that serves to inform health care decisions by integrating and contextualizing research findings across studies. OBJECTIVE: This paper describes the process of establishing an ES capability in the Military Health System dedicated to psychological health topics. RESEARCH DESIGNS: The goal of establishing the current ES capability was to facilitate evidence-based decision-making among clinicians, clinic managers, research funders, and policymakers, through the production and dissemination of trustworthy ES reports. We describe how we developed this capability, provide an overview of the types of evidence syntheses products we use to respond to different stakeholders, and detail the procedures established for selecting and prioritizing synthesis topics. RESULTS: We report on the productivity, acceptability, and impact of our efforts. Our reports were used by a variety of stakeholders and working groups, briefed to major committees, included in official reports and policies, and cited in clinical practice guidelines and the peer-reviewed literature. CONCLUSIONS: Our experiences thus far suggest that the current ES capability offers a needed service within our health system. Our framework may help inform other agencies interested in developing or sponsoring a similar capability.",
