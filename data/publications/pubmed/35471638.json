  "abstract": "Neurodegeneration of the substantia nigra affects putamen activity in Parkinson's disease (PD), yet in vivo evidence of how the substantia nigra modulates putamen glucose metabolism in humans is missing. We aimed to investigate how substantia nigra modulates the putamen glucose metabolism using a cross-sectional design. Resting-state fMRI, susceptibility-weighted imaging, and [[18] F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET (FDG-PET) data were acquired. Forty-two PD patients and 25 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited for simultaneous PET/MRI scanning. The main measurements of the current study were R2* images representing iron deposition (28 PD and 25 HCs), standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) images representing FDG-uptake (33 PD and 25 HCs), and resting state functional connectivity maps from resting state fMRI (34 PD and 25 HCs). An interaction term based on the general linear model was used to investigate the joint modulation effect of nigral iron deposition and nigral-putamen functional connectivity on putamen FDG-uptake. Compared with HCs, we found increased iron deposition in the substantia nigra (p = .007), increased FDG-uptake in the putamen (left: PFWE < 0.001; right: PFWE < 0.001), and decreased functional connectivity between the substantia nigra and the anterior putamen (left PFWE < 0.001, right: PFWE = 0.007). We then identified significant interaction effect of nigral iron deposition and nigral-putamen connectivity on FDG-uptake in the putamen (p = .004). The current study demonstrated joint modulation effect of the substantia nigra iron deposition and nigral-putamen functional connectivity on putamen glucose metabolic distribution, thereby revealing in vivo pathological mechanism of nigrostriatal neurodegeneration of PD.",
