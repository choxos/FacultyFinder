  "title": "Sleep Quality and Fatigue Are Associated with Pain Exacerbations of Hip Osteoarthritis: An Internet-based Case-crossover Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of sleep quality, sleep duration, and fatigue with hip pain exacerbations in persons with symptomatic hip osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: Participants (n = 252) were followed for 90 days and asked to complete online questionnaires at 10-day intervals (control periods). A hip pain exacerbation (case periods) was defined as an increase of 2 points in pain intensity compared with baseline on a numeric rating scale (0-10). Subjective sleep quality and sleep duration were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and fatigue was measured by Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue in both periods. Univariable and multivariable conditional logistic regressions were used to assess the association. RESULTS: Of the 252 participants, 130 (52%) were included in the final analysis. Univariate association analysis showed that both poor sleep quality and greater fatigue were associated with increased odds of pain exacerbations (OR 1.72, 95% CI 1.04-2.86; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.21-3.05, respectively). Short sleep duration was not associated with pain exacerbations. Poor sleep quality and greater fatigue remained associated with pain exacerbations after adjustment for physical activity and night pain levels in multivariable analysis. There was no significant interaction between sleep quality and fatigue (p = 0.21). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep quality and greater fatigue were related to pain exacerbation in persons with symptomatic hip OA. Sleep disorders and fatigue should be considered when dealing with pain exacerbations.",
