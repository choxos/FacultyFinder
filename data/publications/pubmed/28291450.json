  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Military personnel risk injury due to accidents, disasters, and military threats during Phase Zero \"shaping\" operations. Medical facilities must be poised to respond. METHODS: The U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR) covers more than 50% of the earth's surface; relevant Clinical Practice Guidelines must include the maritime setting and extended evacuation periods. Military hospitals in the region are not connected by a defined Trauma System. There is variable adherence to trauma training requirements before assignment in this AOR. Demand for trauma care at any 1 location is low and trauma teams have little opportunity to maintain competency for high-risk/low-volume interventions. There is no documentation of total demand for trauma care in the AOR. Trauma care in PACOM is often deferred to civilian facilities. RESULTS: Core elements of a Joint Theater Trauma System (JTTS) as established during combat operations in U.S. Central Command are applicable during Phase Zero. A PACOM JTTS was established to address the region's readiness to respond to Phase Zero trauma as well as escalation of regional threats. Information technology coordination was a critical hurdle to overcome. CONCLUSION: PACOM lessons learned are applicable to other Geographic Combatant Commands developing a JTTS during Phase Zero operations.",
