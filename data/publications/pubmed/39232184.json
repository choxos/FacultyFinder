  "title": "In vivo and computational investigation of butin against alloxan-induced diabetes via biochemical, histopathological, and molecular interactions.",
  "abstract": "Herbs have been used as medicines since antiquity, and it has been discovered that the human body responds well to herbal remedies. Research on the effect of butin was conducted in the current study in the alloxan-induced diabetic rat paradigm. A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly assigned into the following groups (n = 6): I-Normal; II-Alloxan-induced (50 mg/kg); III-Alloxan + butin 25 mg/kg; IV-Alloxan + butin 50 mg/kg; V-Butin per se 50 mg/kg. Various diabetic parameters (blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c), lipid profile, inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6 and NF-κB), antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GSH), oxidative stress indicators (MDA), apoptosis marker (caspase-3), hepatic markers (ALT and AST), and histopathological changes were assessed. Additionally, molecular docking and dynamics were performed to evaluate the interaction of butin with target proteins. Butin treatment, at both doses, significantly restored biochemical parameters and preserved pancreatic histopathology in diabetic rats. It effectively modulated blood parameters, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, apoptosis, antioxidant enzyme activity, oxidative stress, and hepatic markers. Molecular docking revealed that butin binds to proteins such as caspase-3 (1NME), NF-κB (1SVC), and serum insulin (4IBM) with binding affinities of - 7.4, - 6.5, and - 8.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations further suggested that butin induces significant conformational changes in these proteins. Butin exhibits potential effects against alloxan-induced diabetic rats by restoring biochemical balance, reducing inflammation, and protecting pancreatic tissue. Its binding to key proteins involved in apoptosis and inflammation highlights its therapeutic potential in diabetes management.",
