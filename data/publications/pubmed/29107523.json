  "title": "A Large-Scale Semi-Chronic Microdrive Recording System for Non-Human Primates.",
  "abstract": "Multi-electrode recordings in the non-human primate provide a critical method for measuring the widely distributed activity patterns that underlie brain function. However, common techniques rely on small, often immovable arrays, or microdrives, that are only capable of manipulating a small number of closely spaced probes. These techniques restrict the number of cortical areas that can be simultaneously sampled and are typically not capable of reaching subcortical targets. To overcome these limitations, we developed a large-scale, semi-chronic microdrive recording system with up to 256 independently movable microelectrodes spanning an entire cerebral hemisphere. The microdrive system is hermetically sealed, free of internal connecting wires, and has been used to simultaneously record from up to 37 cortical and subcortical areas in awake behaving monkeys for up to 9 months. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate the capability of this technique to address network-level questions using a graph theoretic analysis of functional connectivity data.",
