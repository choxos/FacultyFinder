  "title": "Safety and efficacy of the bioabsorbable polymer everolimus-eluting stent versus durable polymer drug-eluting stents in high-risk patients undergoing PCI: TWILIGHT-SYNERGY.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Data examining the safety and efficacy of the bioabsorbable polymer (BP) drug-eluting stent (DES) as compared with durable polymer (DP) DES in high-risk patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remain limited. METHODS: We conducted a pre-specified analysis among patients enrolled in the TWILIGHT trial treated with the SYNERGY BP-DES or a DP-DES. Following successful PCI and 3 months of ticagrelor plus aspirin, patients were randomized to aspirin or placebo for 1 year; DES choice was at physician discretion. The primary endpoint was target lesion failure (TLF) [composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction (MI), clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) or definite/probable stent thrombosis (ST)]. RESULTS: Among enrolled participants (N = 9,006), 653 were treated exclusively with the SYNERGY BP-DES and 6,404 with a comparator DP-DES. Over 15 months, TLF rates were 6.4 and 6.1% among those receiving a SYNERGY BP-DES and a DP-DES, respectively (adjusted HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.64-1.35; p = .72). The effect of ticagrelor monotherapy on Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (BARC) type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding and the composite of all-cause death, MI or stroke was uniform across DES groups (both pint  > .10). CONCLUSIONS: The safety and efficacy profile of the SYNERGY BP-DES is comparable to that of contemporary DP-DES in high-risk patients undergoing PCI. Compared to ticagrelor plus aspirin, the effect of ticagrelor monotherapy is consistent among patients receiving SYNERGY BP-DES or DP-DES.",
