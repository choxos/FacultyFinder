  "title": "The Tri-ponderal Mass Index is associated with adiposity in adolescent type 2 diabetes mellitus: a cross-sectional analysis.",
  "abstract": "Pediatric type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients are often overweight or obese, yet there are no validated clinical measures of adiposity to stratify cardiometabolic risk in this population. The tri-ponderal mass index (TMI, kg/m[3]) has recently been reported as a measure of adiposity in children, but there has been no validation of the association of TMI with adiposity in pediatric T2DM. We hypothesized that in children with T2DM, the TMI can serve as a more accurate measure of adiposity when compared to BMI z-score, and that it is associated with components of the metabolic syndrome. This is a cross-sectional secondary data analysis from the Improving Renal Complications in Adolescents with Type 2 Diabetes Through REsearch (iCARE) study (n = 116, age 10.20-17.90 years). Spearman's correlations and multivariable regression were used in the analyses. When compared to DXA, TMI demonstrated significant correlation with total adiposity versus BMI z-score (TMI r = 0.74, p-value < 0.0001; BMI z-score r = - 0.08, p-value 0.403). In regression analyses, TMI was associated with WHtR (B = 35.54, 95% CI 28.81, 42.27, p-value < 0.0001), MAP dipping (B = 1.73, 95% CI 0.12, 3.33, p-value = 0.035), and HDL (B = - 5.83, 95% CI - 10.13, - 1.54, p-value = 0.008). In conclusion, TMI is associated with adiposity and components of the metabolic syndrome in pediatric T2DM patients.",
