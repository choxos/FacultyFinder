  "title": "Past the tipping point: Understanding and addressing burnout among nursing students.",
  "abstract": "Burnout is a widespread concern in healthcare, with nurses bearing a disproportionate burden among healthcare professionals. This epidemic of occupational stress has also affected nursing students, who face the external demands inherent in the profession. In this call-to-action paper, we conducted an extensive literature review exploring strategies aimed at mitigating burnout among nursing students, and offer recommendations for academic institutions, healthcare leaders, research funders, and political leaders, including both the civil service and elected leaders to support the advancement and sustainability of the nursing profession and its workforce.",
