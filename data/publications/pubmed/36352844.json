  "title": "Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia: Updates in pathobiology and diagnosis.",
  "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection have been widely employed to reduce the incidence of symptomatic and severe disease. However, adenovirus-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can cause a rare, thrombotic disorder termed vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT). VITT often develops in the first 5 to 30 days following vaccination and is characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in unusual locations (e.g., cerebral venous sinus thrombosis). The diagnosis is confirmed by testing for anti-PF4 antibodies, as these antibodies are capable of platelet activation without any cofactor. It can be clinically challenging to differentiate VITT from a similar disorder called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), since heparin is commonly used in hospitalized patients. VITT and HIT have similar pathobiology and clinical manifestations but important differences in testing including the need for PF4-enhanced functional assays and the poor reliability of rapid immunoassays for the detection of anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. In this review we summarize the epidemiology of VITT; highlight similarities and differences between HIT and VITT; and provide an update on the clinical diagnosis of VITT.",
