  "title": "A protocol to establish low-cost floating treatment wetlands for large-scale wastewater reclamation.",
  "abstract": "Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) consist of buoyant rafts that support the growth of macrophytes on waterbodies. The long-term performance of these rafts depends on their buoyancy and resistance to weathering. Here, we present a protocol for establishing low-cost FTWs for large-scale wastewater reclamation by integrating traditional ecological knowledge with modern engineering principles. We describe steps for setting up a plant nursery, designing and establishing the FTWs, vegetating units, and building the FTW island. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Afzal et al.[1].",
