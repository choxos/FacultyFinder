  "title": "Getting a \"SMART START\" to gestational diabetes mellitus education: a mixed-methods pilot evaluation of a knowledge translation tool in primary care.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: South Asian people living in Canada face higher rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) compared to national trends. The objective of this study was to design and pilot test a knowledge translation (KT) tool to support GDM prevention counselling in primary care. METHODS: This study is a mixed-methods pilot evaluation of the \"SMART START\" KT tool involving 2 family physicians in separate practices and 20 pregnant South Asians in Ontario, Canada. We conducted the quantitative and qualitative components in parallel, developing a joint display to illustrate the converging and diverging elements. RESULTS: Between January and July 2020, 20 South Asian pregnant people were enrolled in this study. A high level of acceptability was received from patients and practitioners for timing, content, format, language, and interest in the interventions delivered. Quantitative findings revealed gaps in patient knowledge and behaviour in the following areas: GDM risk factors, the impact of GDM on the unborn baby, weight gain recommendations, diet, physical activity practices, and tracking of weight gain. From the qualitative component, we found that physicians valued and were keen to engage in GDM prevention counselling. Patients also expressed personal perceptions of healthy active living during pregnancy, experiences, and preferences with gathering and searching for information, and key preventative behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Building on this knowledge can contribute to the design and implementation of other research opportunities or test new hypotheses as they relate to GDM prevention among South Asian communities.",
