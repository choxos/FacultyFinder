  "title": "Quantification of Glucocorticoid-Associated Morbidity in Severe Asthma Using the Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoid (GC)-associated morbidity in severe asthma (SA) is well recognized but varies in individual patients; systematic measurement of GC toxicity is important to measure improvement with steroid-sparing monoclonal antibodies. OBJECTIVE: To describe for the first time individual patient GC toxicity in steroid-dependent SA using the Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index (GTI). METHODS: An observational consecutive patient cohort study was performed at a UK Regional SA Specialist clinic for systematic assessment of GC-associated morbidity using the GTI in routine clinical care. GTI was correlated with commonly used patient-reported outcome measures. An approach to GTI scoring, calculation of minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and development of digital GTI application in routine clinical care are described. RESULTS: All patients had significant oral GC exposure (cumulative prednisolone/prior year, 4280 [3083, 5475] mg) with wide distribution of toxicity in individual patients (mean GTI score, 177.5 [73.7]). GTI score had only modest correlation with recent prednisolone exposure: maintenance prednisolone dose (rho = 0.26, P = .01), cumulative exposure/prior year (rho = 0.38, P < .001), and GC boosts/prior year (rho = 0.25, P = .01). GTI toxicity demonstrated stronger associations with asthma-related quality of life (mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [mini-AQLQ] r = -0.50, P < .001 and St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire r = 0.42, P < .001). GTI MCID was calculated as 10 points. Multiple linear regression demonstrated that age and mini-AQLQ were strongest predictors of GC toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The GTI is a useful tool to systematically capture and quantify GC toxicity at the individual patient level. GC toxicity varies widely between individual patients with SA and correlated only modestly with GC exposure over the preceding year. Age and mini-AQLQ are better predictors of GC toxicity. The GTI and MCID will facilitate assessment of individual SA response to steroid-sparing agents in clinical trials and routine care.",
