  "title": "Sheathless Focusing and Separation of Microparticles Using Tilted-Angle Traveling Surface Acoustic Waves.",
  "abstract": "Sheathless focusing and separation of microparticles is an important preprocessing step in various biochemical assays in which enriched sample isolation is critical. Most of the previous microfluidic particle separation techniques have used sheath flows to achieve efficient sample focusing. The sheath flow dilutes the analyte and requires additional microchannels and accurate flow control. We demonstrated a tilted-angle traveling surface acoustic wave (taTSAW)-based sheathless focusing and separation of particles in a continuous flow. The proposed device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with a pair of interdigitated transducers (IDTs) deposited at two different angles relative to the flow direction. A Y-shaped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchannel having one inlet and two outlet ports was positioned on top of the IDTs such that the acoustic energy coupling into the fluid was maximized and wave attenuation by the PDMS walls was minimized. The two IDTs independently produced high-frequency taTSAWs, which propagated at ±30° with respect to the flow direction and imparted a direct acoustic radiation force onto the target particles. A sample mixture of 4.8 and 3.2 μm particles was focused and then separated by the actuation of the IDTs at 194 and 136 MHz frequencies, respectively, without using an additional sheath flow. The proposed taTSAW-based particle separation device offered a high purity >99% at the both outlets over a wide range of flow speeds (up to 83.3 mm/s).",
