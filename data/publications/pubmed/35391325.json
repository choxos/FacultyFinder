  "abstract": "For the first time in the Palaearctic Region, the New World leafhopper genus Draeculacephala Ball (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae) has been recorded in France (Pyrenes-Orientales) and Spain (Catalonia). The species present in both countries is Draeculacephala robinsoni Hamilton 1967, among the most common and widespread species of the genus Draeculacephala in eastern North America. Comments on the identification of this species are presented. The species already seems to be firmly established in the region since it has been found in 11 different sites with a maximum distance of 86 km between them. Since the genus has been reported to be a vector of plant pathogens including Xylella fastidiosa its further spread in Europe should be closely monitored.",
