  "title": "Comparative Efficacy of Nonoperative Treatments for Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: An evolved understanding of the pathophysiology of greater trochanteric pain syndrome has led to a number of proposed nonoperative management strategies. The objective of this review was to compare the efficacy of the various nonoperative treatments for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). DESIGN: Systematic review and network meta-analysis. SETTING: PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, SCOPUS, and Web of Science were searched to January 2020. PATIENTS: Patients undergoing nonoperative treatment for GTPS. INTERVENTIONS: Nonoperative treatment strategies for GTPS including injections of corticosteroids, platelet-rich plasma, hyaluronic acid, dry needling, and structured exercise programs and extracorporeal shockwave therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain and functional outcomes. Bayesian random-effects model was performed to assess the direct and indirect comparison of all treatment options. RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials and 1034 patients were included. For pain scores at 1 to 3 months follow-up, both platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and shockwave therapy demonstrated significantly better pain scores compared with the no treatment control group with PRP having the highest probability of being the best treatment at both 1 to 3 months and 6 to 12 months. No proposed therapies significantly outperformed the no treatment control group for pain scores at 6 to 12 months. Structured exercise had the highest probability of being the best treatment for improvements in functional outcomes and was the only treatment that significantly improved functional outcome scores compared with the no treatment arm at 1 to 3 months. CONCLUSION: Current evidence suggests that PRP and shockwave therapy may provide short-term (1-3 months) pain relief, and structured exercise leads to short-term (1-3 months) improvements in functional outcomes.",
