  "title": "The effect of altered sleep timing on glycaemic outcomes: Systematic review of human intervention studies.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: Alterations in sleep timing can lead to disturbances in glycaemic control, although the evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, this systematic review summarizes results from human intervention studies of altered sleep timing on glycaemic outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As part of a broader search on the effect of altering timing of sleep, physical activity and dietary intake, Medline and Embase were searched from inception to February 2023, and subsequent reference searches were done. With the help of a machine learning-aided program 'ASReview', we selected any type of intervention study in the general adult population, which acutely delayed sleep by ≥2 h for at least one night, while the total time in bed was the same between early and late sleep. Quality assessment was done using the quality assessment tool for quantitative studies. RESULTS: In total, 14 studies (159 adults with normal or increased weight) were identified. Methodological quality was high (n = 4), moderate (n = 7) or low (n = 3). Acute delays of sleep onset showed unfavourable effects in 10 out of 27 measured glycaemic outcomes (one-six studies reported on each outcome) with outcomes mostly measured in the postprandial period, compared to (early) nighttime sleep. CONCLUSIONS: Acutely delaying sleep timing might have unfavourable effects on glycaemic outcomes, compared to (early) nighttime sleep. Future research does however need better controlled trials, also measuring and controlling sleep quantity, sleep quality, physical activity and dietary intake, with longer follow-up periods, consistent outcomes and designs and more diverse populations to provide targeted advice regarding the optimal timing for sleep. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: This review is part of a larger search 'The effect of altering timing of physical activity, sleep and energy intake on glycaemia and Type 2 Diabetes risk in humans', of which the protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database on 27 November 2021 under number: CRD42021287828.",
