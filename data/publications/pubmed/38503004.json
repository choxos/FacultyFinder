  "title": "Circular RNAs in the KRAS pathway: Emerging players in cancer progression.",
  "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recognized as key components in the intricate regulatory network of the KRAS pathway across various cancers. The KRAS pathway, a central signalling cascade crucial in tumorigenesis, has gained substantial emphasis as a possible therapeutic target. CircRNAs, a subgroup of non-coding RNAs known for their closed circular arrangement, play diverse roles in gene regulation, contributing to the intricate landscape of cancer biology. This review consolidates existing knowledge on circRNAs within the framework of the KRAS pathway, emphasizing their multifaceted functions in cancer progression. Notable circRNAs, such as Circ_GLG1 and circITGA7, have been identified as pivotal regulators in colorectal cancer (CRC), influencing KRAS expression and the Ras signaling pathway. Aside from their significance in gene regulation, circRNAs contribute to immune evasion, apoptosis, and drug tolerance within KRAS-driven cancers, adding complexity to the intricate interplay. While our comprehension of circRNAs in the KRAS pathway is evolving, challenges such as the diverse landscape of KRAS mutant tumors and the necessity for synergistic combination therapies persist. Integrating cutting-edge technologies, including deep learning-based prediction methods, holds the potential for unveiling disease-associated circRNAs and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Sustained research efforts are crucial to comprehensively unravel the molecular mechanisms governing the intricate interplay between circRNAs and the KRAS pathway, offering insights that could potentially revolutionize cancer diagnostics and treatment strategies.",
