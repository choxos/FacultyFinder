  "title": "Monitoring of erosive tooth wear: what to use and when to use it.",
  "abstract": "Although we are increasingly recognising the need to assess patients for accelerated rates of tooth wear progression, it is often difficult to do so within a feasible diagnostic window. This paper aims to provide evidence-based timelines which a diagnosing clinician can expect to assess tooth wear progression in study models, clinical indices, clinical photographs and visually with intraoral scans. It also discusses new technologies emerging for the quantitative assessment of tooth wear, timelines for diagnosis, and caveats in the 3D scan registration and analysis process.",
