  "abstract": "Chronic sclerosing sialadenitis, also known as Küttner's tumour, is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the salivary glands. We present the case of an arteriovenous vascular malformation (AVM) of the right submandibular gland mimicking a Küttner's tumour on ultrasound scan in a 63-year-old woman. Examination revealed a 2 cm firm, mobile, non-pulsatile, right-sided submandibular mass with no overlying skin changes but with mild tenderness to palpation. Histological appearances revealed an AVM associated with localised fatty metaplasia and glandular atrophy. Although rare, AVMs should be considered a differential diagnosis for a submandibular gland mass that gives unclear or unusual radiological appearances.",
