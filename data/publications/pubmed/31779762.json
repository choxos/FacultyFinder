  "title": "Deep-seated Hibernoma of Thigh: A Rare Benign Adipocytic Tumor.",
  "abstract": "Hibernoma is a rare benign soft tissue adipocytic tumor. Mostly found in adults, it is usually located in the limbs, and is deepseated or intramuscular. Usually asymptomatic, it causes symptoms when it becomes large enough to compress adjacent structures, mimicking well differentiated liposarcoma clinically and radiologically. We present a case report of a deepseated hibernoma of thigh. Radiological investigation and incisional biopsy were done to diagnose and define the surgical roadmap to completely excise it. We describe our technique to precisely control feeding vessels and meticulous dissection to preserve thigh muscles to retain function.",
