  "abstract": "Hemodynamic assessment remains the most valuable adjunct to physical examination and laboratory assessment in the diagnosis and management of shock. Through the years, multiple modalities to measure and trend hemodynamic indices have evolved with varying degrees of invasiveness. Pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has long been considered the gold standard of hemodynamic assessment in critically ill patients and in recent years has been shown to improve clinical outcomes among patients in cardiogenic shock. The invasive nature of PAC is often cited as its major limitation and has encouraged development of less invasive technologies. In this review, the authors summarize the literature on the mechanism and validation of several minimally invasive and noninvasive modalities available in the contemporary intensive care unit. They also provide an update on the use of focused bedside echocardiography.",
