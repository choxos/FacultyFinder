  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is frequently accompanied with metabolic dysfunctions, yet the causal relationships between metabolic factors and PCOS remain to be conclusively established and etiology-based therapies are lacking. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively identify the metabolic causal factors and potential drug targets for PCOS. METHODS: This genetic association study was conducted using bidirectional two-sample Mendelian Randomization (MR), multivariable MR (MVMR) and drug-target MR. Considering metabolic sexual dimorphism, female-specific genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for metabolic factors were obtained. To ensure the robustness of the findings, an additional independent PCOS GWAS dataset was utilized for replication. RESULTS: The PCOS cohort included 10,074 PCOS cases (mean age 28 to 45 years) and 103,164 controls (mean age 27 to 60 years) of European ancestry. All participants were female. Employing two-sample MR analysis, we found that genetically proxied body mass index (BMI) (OR = 3.40 [95 % CI, 2.65-4.36]), triglyceride (TG) (OR = 1.54 [95 % CI, 1.17-2.04]), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) (OR = 1.37 [95 % CI, 1.07-1.76]), and type 2 diabetes (T2D) (OR = 1.24 [95 % CI, 1.09-1.41]) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PCOS, whereas genetically predicted high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) (OR = 0.61 [95 % CI, 0.47-0.80]) decreased the odds of PCOS. Stepwise MVMR established a hierarchy of interactions among these metabolic factors, identifying BMI and HDL-c as the most prominent causal factors. Notably, drug-target MR analysis identified incretin-based therapeutics, PCSK9 inhibitors, LPL gene therapy, sulfonylureas, and thiazolidinediones as potential therapeutics for PCOS. All these findings were validated in an independent dataset. CONCLUSION: This study offered insights into the roles of obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in PCOS etiology and therapeutics, underscoring the necessity for managing metabolic health in women and paving the way for tailored therapeutic strategies for PCOS based on its metabolic underpinnings.",
