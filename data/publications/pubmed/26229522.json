  "abstract": "Collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data are essential components of biomedical research and require biostatistics. Doing various statistical tests has been made easy by sophisticated computer software. It is important for the investigator and the interpreting clinician to understand the basics of biostatistics for two reasons. The first is to choose the right statistical test for the computer to perform based on the nature of data derived from one's own research. The second is to understand if an analysis was performed appropriately during review and interpretation of others' research. This article reviews the choice of an appropriate parametric or nonparametric statistical test based on type of variable and distribution of data. Evaluation of diagnostic tests is covered with illustrations and tables.",
