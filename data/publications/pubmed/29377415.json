  "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of viral acute respiratory tract infections in young children. The virus is characterised by distinct seasonality that is dependent upon the latitude and its ability to cause reinfection. Respiratory syncytial virus demonstrates a complex molecular epidemiology pattern as multiple strains and/or genotypes cocirculate during a single epidemic. Previous studies have investigated the relationship between RSV genetic diversity, reinfection, and clinical features. Here, we review the evidence behind this relationship together with the impact that the advancement of whole genome sequencing will have upon our understanding and the need for reconsidering the classification of RSV genotypes.",
