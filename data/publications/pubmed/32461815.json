  "title": "Approaches to Minimizing Periprocedural Complications During Subcutaneous Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillator Placement.",
  "abstract": "The subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) is the latest option among devices clinically available for the prevention of sudden cardiac death, with experience from previous trials and postmarketing studies supporting the feasibility and safety of this kind of system. The extracardiac positioning of the S-ICD obviates the need for transvenous leads, which translates into lower incidence rates of lead-related complications and systemic infections. This review will highlight the results of pertinent studies related to the perioperative management of S-ICDs and review potential approaches to minimizing the risk of complications such as hematoma at the pulse generator location, unsuccessful defibrillation due to suboptimal S-ICD lead and generator positioning, and postoperative pain. An extensive literature search using PubMed was conducted to identify relevant articles.",
