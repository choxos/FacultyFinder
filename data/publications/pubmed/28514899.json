  "title": "Clinical Positioning Accuracy for Multisession Stereotactic Radiotherapy With the Gamma Knife Perfexion.",
  "abstract": "Multisession stereotactic radiation therapy is increasingly being seen as a preferred option for intracranial diseases in close proximity to critical structures and for larger target volumes. The objective of this study is to investigate the reproducibility of the Extend system from Elekta. A retrospective review was conducted for all patients treated with multisession Gamma Knife between July 2010 and June 2015, including both malignant and benign lesions. Eighty-four patients were treated in this 5-year span. The average residual daily setup uncertainty was 0.48 (0.19) mm. We compare measurements of setup uncertainty from the Extend system to measurements performed with a linac-based approach previously used in our center. The Extend system has significantly reduced setup uncertainty for fractionated intracranial treatments at our institution. Positive results were observed in a small population of edentulous patients. The Extend system compares favorably with other approaches to delivering intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy and is a robust, simple-to-use, and precise method for treating multisession intracranial lesions.",
