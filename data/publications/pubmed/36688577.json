  "title": "Gene-targeted therapies: Towards equitable development, diagnosis, and access.",
  "abstract": "Genomic and gene-targeted therapies hold great promise in addressing the global issue of rare diseases. To achieve this promise, however, it is critical the twin goals of equity in access to testing and diagnosis, and equity in access to therapy be considered early in the life cycle of development and implementation. Rare disease researchers and clinicians must simultaneously recognize the life-altering potential of early diagnosis and administration of gene-targeted therapeutics while acknowledging that not everyone who experiences a rare disease and needs these therapies will be able to afford or access them. Achieving equity in the development of and access to gene-targeted therapies will not only require innovations in research, clinical, regulatory, and reimbursement frameworks, but will also necessitate increased attention to the ethical, legal, and social implications when establishing research paradigms and the translation of research results into novel interventions for rare genetic diseases. This article highlights and discusses the growing importance and recognition of health equity across the spectrum of rare disease research and care delivery.",
