  "title": "Research, Sovereignty and Action: Lessons from a First Nations-Led Study on Aging in Ontario.",
  "abstract": "First Nations in Ontario are building capacity to leverage health services data in Ontario to provide robust, First Nations-driven health evidence. Beyond providing evidence, population health research processes must involve diverse First Nations' perspectives, collective capacity building and translation of research findings into action through integrated and community engaged knowledge translation and exchange (KTE) approaches. Suggested ways include integrating stories and traditional knowledge, prioritizing gatherings and establishing an enduring commitment to action. To effectively support First Nations' self-determination and sovereignty, First Nations' principles of ownership, control, access and possession (OCAPÂ®) in research could be expanded to include \"action\" (OCAPA).",
