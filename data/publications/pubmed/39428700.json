  "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is manifested by a gradual loss of physical, cognitive, and mental abilities. As the disease advances, age has a major impact on the pathogenic signature of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregation. This review aims to explore the intricate relationship between aging, mHTT toxicity, and cellular senescence in HD. Scientific data on the interplay between aging, mHTT, and cellular senescence in HD were collected from several academic databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, Google, and ScienceDirect. The search terms employed were \"AGING,\" \"HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE,\" \"MUTANT HUNTINGTIN,\" and \"CELLULAR SENESCENCE.\" Additionally, to gather information on the molecular mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets, the search was extended to include relevant terms such as \"DNA DAMAGE,\" \"OXIDATIVE STRESS,\" and \"AUTOPHAGY.\" According to research, aging leads to worsening HD pathophysiology through some processes. As a result of the mHTT accumulation, cellular senescence is promoted, which causes DNA damage, oxidative stress, decreased autophagy, and increased inflammatory responses. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and other substances are released by senescent cells, which may worsen the neuronal damage and the course of the disease. It has been shown that treatments directed at these pathways reduce some of the HD symptoms and enhance longevity in experimental animals, pointing to a new possibility of treating the condition. Through their amplification of the harmful effects of mHTT, aging and cellular senescence play crucial roles in the development of HD. Comprehending these interplays creates novel opportunities for therapeutic measures targeted at alleviating cellular aging and enhancing HD patients' quality of life.",
