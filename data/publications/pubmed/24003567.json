  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a major public health problem worldwide, and it is a known risk factor for coronary artery disease. Younger population, a group which lacks epidemiological data on diabetes mellitus, the prevalence of diabetes in them was investigated in the rural districts of north Bihar (India). Furthermore, the risk factors associated with diabetes mellitus in this younger population were also assessed. A total of 3957 subjects in the age group of 12-30 years from northern Bihar participated in the study. Data were obtained from history, random capillary blood glucose levels detected by glucometer and body mass index. Of the available 3955 results, glucometer identified 103 subjects (2.6%) as positives with the cut-off value of 150 mg/dl. Out of these, 12 (0.3%) were diabetic while 35 (0.88%) had impaired glycaemic control by intravenous blood sugar method. The random blood glucose levels varied from 53-391 mg/dl (mean and SD: 105.3 and 21.2). Amongst these subjects; only 103 (2.6%) were declared to be diabetic. The fasting and postprandial blood glucose levels for diabetic subjectes were 148.5 and 227.1 mg/dl respectively. The logistic regression evidenced that positive glucometer results was associated with age (> 25 years), sex (male), high BMI (> 18.5), high BP (> 120/80) and occupation. The increasing prevalence of diabetes in young may have adverse effects on nation's health and economy. Data from this study highlights the importance of early screening, diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus.",
