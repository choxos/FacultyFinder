  "title": "Rationale and design of the PE-TRACT trial: A multicenter randomized trial to evaluate catheter-directed therapy for the treatment of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal management of patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE), who have right heart dysfunction (determined by a combination of imaging and cardiac biomarkers) but a normal blood pressure, is uncertain. These patients suffer from reduced functional capacity and a lower quality of life over the long-term, despite use of anticoagulant therapy. Catheter-directed therapy (CDT) is a promising treatment for acute PE that rapidly removes thrombus and potentially improves cardiac dysfunction. However, CDT has risk and is costly, and it is not known whether it improves long-term cardiorespiratory fitness and/or quality of life compared with anticoagulation alone. METHODS: We are therefore conducting an open-label, assessor-blinded, multicenter randomized trial, the Pulmonary Embolism: Thrombus Removal with Catheter-Directed Therapy (PE-TRACT) Study, to compare CDT plus anticoagulation (CDT group) with anticoagulation alone (No-CDT group) in 500 patients with intermediate-risk PE. The primary study hypothesis is that CDT will increase the peak oxygen uptake (peak VO2) with cardiopulmonary exercise testing at 3 months and reduce New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class at 12 months compared with No-CDT. These 2 primary efficacy outcomes will be analyzed sequentially using a \"gatekeeping\" procedure; for NYHA class to be compared, peak oxygen consumption must first be shown to be significantly increased by CDT. Safety and cost-effectiveness will also be assessed. CONCLUSION: When completed, PE-TRACT will provide important evidence regarding the benefits and risks of CDT to treat intermediate-risk PE compared with anticoagulation alone.
