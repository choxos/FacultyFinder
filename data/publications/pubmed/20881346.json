  "title": "Endodontic treatment of a maxillary first molar having three mesiobuccal canals with the aid of spiral computed tomography: a case report.",
  "abstract": "Variations in the dental anatomy are found in all teeth. Understanding root canal morphology is one of the most important steps in successful root canal treatment. Thus, during the diagnosis and treatment phases of maxillary molars, a clinician must be aware that anatomical variations exist. The purpose of this study is to present a clinical case of a maxillary first molar having three mesiobuccal canals with separate orifices. This unusual morphology was confirmed by spiral computed tomography (SCT). This article discusses the variations in canal morphology and the role of SCT in successfully diagnosing and negotiating them.",
