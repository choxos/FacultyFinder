  "title": "People with HIV as educators of health professionals.",
  "abstract": "This qualitative study examined the impact upon people living with HIV (PHAs), of being trained and utilized as educators of health professionals. PHAs participated in a training program to help them develop skills to facilitate learners in problem-based educational events. After training the PHAs participated in small group problem-based tutorials with separate groups of physiotherapy and occupational therapy students and family medicine residents. Content analyses of the PHAs' reflective journals and semistructured interviews conducted at completion of the project indicated there was a positive impact on their teaching skills, self-awareness, personal understanding of HIV, confidence in teaching, and everyday life. Learner feedback indicated that they valued their interactions with the PHAs. This model of education has the potential to positively benefit patients living with a variety of illnesses and disabilities.",
