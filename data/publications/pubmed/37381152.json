  "title": "Fertility assessment and treatment in adolescent and young adult cancer survivors.",
  "abstract": "In the survivorship setting, adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors frequently demonstrate little knowledge of infertility risk, are unclear regarding their fertility status, and may under- or overestimate their treatment-related risk for infertility. In female AYA survivors, ovarian function usually parallels fertility, and can be assessed with serum hormone levels and ultrasonography. Posttreatment fertility preservation may be appropriate for survivors at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency. In male AYA survivors, fertility and gonadal function are not always equally affected, and can be assessed with a semen analysis and serum hormones, respectively. As reproductive health issues are commonly cited as an important concern by survivors of AYA cancer, multidisciplinary care teams including oncology, endocrinology, psychology, and reproductive medicine are advocated, with the aim of optimal provision of fertility advice and care for AYA cancer survivors.",
