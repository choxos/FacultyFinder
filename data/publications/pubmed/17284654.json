  "title": "Exercise-induced hemolysis is caused by protein modification and most evident during the early phase of an ultraendurance race.",
  "abstract": "Whether structural changes of the erythrocyte membrane increase the susceptibility to hemolysis particularly of the relatively older cell population during the early phase of a 216-km ultrarace was tested in six male runners (age 53.6 +/- 10.4 yr, height 175.8 +/- 11.1 cm, body mass 75.9 +/- 8.4 kg). Erythrocyte membrane spectrins were lowest (P < 0.001) after 42 km (75.59 +/- 5.25% of prerace) and increased (P < 0.001) toward 216 km (88.27 +/- 3.37%). Susceptibility to osmotic hemolysis was highest (P < 0.01) after 42 km (107.34 +/- 3.02 mOsm sodium phosphate buffer) with almost identical (P > 0.05) values prerace (97.98 +/- 3.41 mOsm) and postrace (98.61 +/- 3.26 mOsm). Haptoglobin indicated intravascular hemolysis of 9.27 x 10(9) cells/l (P < 0.05) during the initial 84 km. Changes in hematocrit and plasma proteins indicated an estimated total net erythrocyte loss of 3.47 x 10(11) cells/l (P < 0.05) after 21 km. This was compensated by a gain in erythrocytes (P < 0.05) of 3.31 x 10(11) cells/l during the final 132 km. A main effect (P < 0.05) on erythropoietin suggests increased erythropoiesis throughout the race. Exercise-induced hemolysis reflects alterations in erythrocyte membrane spectrins and occurs particularly in the early phase of an ultraendurance race because of a relative older cell population.",
