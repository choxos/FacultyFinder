  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Etanercept is one of a new subgroup of biological disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who are non-responsive or intolerant to conventional DMARD. We evaluated the effects of etanercept (Enbrel) therapy in patients with RA in community-based clinical practice in Canada. METHODS: Using a cohort design, patients requesting etanercept therapy were stratified into treatment and control arms based upon their individual accessibility to obtain the drug. Patients were interviewed serially during a 12-month period of monitoring. The study measured painful or tender joint count, morning stiffness, pain severity, quality of life measures, medication utilization, health services utilization, and presence of adverse events. RESULTS: The baseline demographic and clinical variables for the treatment group (n = 223) and the control group (n = 208) were similar, except for education, income, and drug plan coverage. In followup, there was greater improvement in most clinical variables in the treatment arm compared to the control arm during the first 6 months, but the magnitude of difference between the 2 groups for some clinical variables decreased or became non-significant during the second 6 months. During the 12 month followup period there were 40 (18%) patient dropouts in the treatment group. CONCLUSION: In a community based setting for the treatment of RA, etanercept can effectively improve the disease state, functional class, work disability, and quality of life during the first 6 months of use. To determine the longterm sustainability of these effects studies with more than 12 months' duration will be required.",
