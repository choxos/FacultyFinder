  "abstract": "The G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. The GPER selective agonist G-1 has been a useful tool for exploring the biological roles of GPER in a variety of experimental settings, including SMC proliferation. The present study, originally designed to investigate cellular and signaling mechanisms underlying the regulatory role of GPER in vascular SMC proliferation using G-1, unexpectedly revealed off-target effects of G-1. G-1(1-10 Î¼M) inhibited bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation of human SMCs and caused G2/M cell accumulation. G-1 treatment also increased mitotic index concurrent with a decrease in phosphorylation of Cdk1 (Tyr 15) and an increase in phosphorylation of the mitotic checkpoint protein BuBR1. Furthermore, G-1 caused microtubule disruption, mitotic spindle damage, and tubulin depolymerization. G-1 induced cell apoptosis as indicated by the appearance of TUNEL-positive and annexin V-positive cells with enhanced cleavage of caspases 3 and 9. However, neither the GPER antagonist G-15 nor the MAPK kinase inhibitor PD98059 prevented these G-1 effects. Down-regulation of GPER or p44/42 MAPK with siRNA transfection also did not affect the G-1-induced apoptosis. We conclude that G-1 inhibits proliferation of SMCs through mechanisms involving mitotic arrest and apoptosis, independent of GPER and the MAPK pathway.",
