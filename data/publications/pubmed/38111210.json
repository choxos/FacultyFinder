  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Adolescent alcohol consumption has been declining across many countries, with rates of abstinence also increasing among younger cohorts. A range of socio-demographic variables and personality traits are associated with alcohol use; however, no study has examined whether the relationship between personality and drinking has changed over time as adolescent drinking has declined. METHODS: Data from 15- to 17-year-old respondents were extracted from four waves (2004/2005, 2008/2009, 2012/2013, 2016/2017) of a long running Australian cohort study. Logistic regression analyses with interaction terms were used to determine whether personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and emotional stability) and socio-demographic variables (age, gender, equivalised income, family structure, cultural background, school attendance and regionality) significantly differed between drinkers and abstainers and whether these relationships changed across cohorts. RESULTS: The prevalence of drinking for 15- to 17-year-olds significantly declined over each survey wave from 54% in 2004/2005 to 24% in 2016/2017. Conscientiousness (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, confidence interval [CI] = 0.73, 0.93), extraversion ([OR] 1.25, [CI] = 1.11, 1.40) and emotional stability ([OR] 0.73, [CI] = 0.64, 0.83) were all significant predictors of alcohol consumption. No significant interactions between cohort and personality traits or socio-demographic variables were found. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: The study found no evidence to indicate that the relationship between adolescent alcohol consumption and personality has changed. Similarly, socio-demographic relationships with drinking were stable as drinking prevalence dropped by more than half. This adds to the evidence that drinking declines among adolescents are spread broadly across the population and not concentrated within identifiable sub-groups of young people.",
