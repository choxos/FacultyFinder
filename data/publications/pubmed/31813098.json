  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To assess the feasibility and safety of same-day discharge after S-ICD implantation by implementing a specific analgesia protocol and phone follow-up. METHODS: Consecutive patients presenting for outpatient S-ICD implantation were enrolled between 1/1/2018 and 4/30/2019. An analgesia protocol included pre-operative acetaminophen and oxycodone, intraoperative local bupivacaine, and limited use of oxycodone-acetaminophen at discharge. The primary outcome was successful same-day discharge. Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 14, and 30 and any unplanned health care visits during the 1-month follow-up period were assessed. RESULTS: Out of 53 potentially eligible S-ICD patients, 49 patients (92.5%) were enrolled and successfully discharged on the same day. Mean age of these 49 patients was 47 ± 14 years. There were no acute procedural complications. Severe pain (NPRS ≥ 8) on POD 0, 1, and 3 was present in 14.3%, 14.3%, and 8.2% of patients, respectively. The total in-hospital stay was 534 ± 80 min. Four unplanned visits (8%) due to cardiac or device-related issues occurred during 1-month follow-up, including 2 patients with heart failure exacerbation, one patient with an incisional infection, and one patient with inappropriate shocks. CONCLUSIONS: With the appropriate institutional protocol including specific analgesics and phone follow-up, same-day discharge after outpatient S-ICD implantation is feasible and appears safe for most patients.. Device-related pain can be severe in the first 3 days post-implantation and can be successfully treated with limited supply of narcotic medications.",
