  "title": "Emotion socialization parenting interventions targeting emotional competence in young children: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although emotion socialization parenting interventions are supported by a growing body of literature, their effects have yet to be systematically examined. The present systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the evidence for emotion socialization parenting interventions for parents of young children. METHODS: Six electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to October 5th, 2022. We conducted random effects meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials of emotion socialization interventions delivered to parents of children aged 18 months to 6 years 11 months. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies which reported data from 15 individual trials met the inclusion criteria. Interventions had a positive effect on positive and negative emotion socialization parenting practices (g's = 0.50) and child emotional competence (g = 0.44). Interventions also had a positive effect on positive (g = 0.74) and negative parenting behaviors (g = 0.25), parent psychological well-being (g = 0.28), and child behavioral adjustment (g = 0.34). Findings remained significant after considering potential publication bias and conducting sensitivity analyses. Two significant moderating factors emerged. CONCLUSIONS: Emotion socialization parenting interventions are effective for improving emotion socialization parenting practices and child emotional competence. Additional methodologically rigorous trials are needed to buttress the current evidence and provide evidence for additional moderating factors.",
