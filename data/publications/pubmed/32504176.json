  "abstract": "Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic for treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. The conventional eye drop dosage form is the widely used mode of treatment, but it has low corneal residence time. This drawback can be overcome by developing a bioadhesive noisome system (chitosan-coated) for enhanced corneal residence time. The niosomes were prepared by thin-film hydration technique and optimized by using Box-Behnken statistical design software. Cholesterol (A), Span 60 (B), and sonication time (C) were selected as independent variables, whereas vesicle size (Y1 in nm), entrapment efficiency (Y2 in %), and drug release (Y3 in %) were chosen as dependent variables. The vesicle size, entrapment efficiency, and drug release of optimized CIP niosomes (CIP-NSMopt) were found to be 180.34 ± 5.13 nm, 78.32 ± 4.49%, and 82.87 ± 4.01% (in 12 h), respectively. Further CIP-NSMopt was coated with different chitosan concentrations (0.1 to 0.3%) to enhance mucoadhesion. Finally, optimized chitosan-coated niosomes (chitosomes; CIP-CHTopt) showed a vesicle size of 210.65 ± 2.76 nm, zeta potential of - 35.17 ± 2.25Mv, and PDI of 0.221. CIP-CHTopt exhibited sustained release profile (75.31% in 12 h) with the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model (R[2] = 0.980). The permeation study showed 1.79-fold enhancements in corneal permeation compared with marketed CIP eye drop. The hen's egg chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) study showed 0 scores (no irritation), and it was further confirmed by corneal hydration and histopathology study. The antimicrobial study exhibited a significant high zone (P < 0.05) of inhibition against tested organism. Our findings demonstrated that chitosan-coated niosomes are a promising drug carrier to enhance corneal contact time and treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis.",
