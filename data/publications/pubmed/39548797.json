  "title": "Integrating informal and formal care: An innovative, scalable program blueprint.",
  "abstract": "People have infinite needs, including illness prevention, wellness, self-care, practical support, and quality of life. This article describes community-based, informal care programs that help people identify their needs, set goals, and organize networks of care to address their needs holistically in a way that can also significantly reduce healthcare costs. Approaches can be customized for primary care, home and community, hospice, and other care sectors to facilitate low-cost, high impact adoption. We provide a blueprint for programs that integrate informal and formal care across social, physical, and mental health domains as a key part of healthcare system transformation.",
