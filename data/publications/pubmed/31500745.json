  "title": "Radiographic Prevalence of Sacroiliac Joint Abnormalities and Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To quantify the prevalence of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) abnormalities in patients undergoing hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) by use of various imaging modalities and to compare outcomes based on SIJ abnormalities. METHODS: Plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of patients who underwent primary hip arthroscopy for FAIS from January 2012 to January 2016 were identified. The exclusion criteria included patients undergoing bilateral or revision surgery, those with a history of dysplasia, and those with less than 2 years' follow-up. On radiographs, the SIJs were graded using modified New York criteria for spondyloarthropathy. CT and MRI scans were reviewed for joint surface erosion, subchondral sclerosis, joint space narrowing, pseudo-widening, bone marrow edema, and ankylosis. Patients with SIJ abnormalities were matched to patients without SIJ abnormalities in a 1:2 ratio by age and body mass index. Outcomes included the Hip Outcome Score-Activities of Daily Living (HOS-ADL), Hip Outcome Score-Sports Subscale (HOS-SS), modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and VAS for satisfaction. RESULTS: Of 1,009 consecutive patients, 743 (73.6%) were included; 187 (25.2%) showed SIJ changes. Of these 187 patients, 164 (87.7%) had changes on plain radiographs, 88 (47.1%) had changes on CT, and 125 (66.8%) had changes on MRI. SIJ changes on any imaging modality were weakly correlated with pain to palpation of the SIJ (r = 0.11, P = .004) on physical examination. Pain to palpation of the SIJ on physical examination (odds ratio [OR], 1.12; P = .031) and a history of SIJ pain (OR, 1.93; P = .018) increased the odds of having an SIJ abnormality on any imaging modality. After matching, patients without SIJ abnormalities had a significantly greater HOS-ADL (95.4 vs 90.6, P = .001), HOS-SS (91.1 vs 77.5, P < .001), and mHHS (91.3 vs 84.5, P < .001) and a significantly lower VAS pain score (10.9 vs 25.7, P < .001) than patients with abnormalities at a mean follow-up of 34.1 ± 9.7 months (range, 24-54 months). Patients without SIJ abnormalities had greater odds of achieving the minimal clinically important difference for the HOS-ADL (OR, 2.91; P = .001) and for the HOS-SS (OR, 2.83; P < .001) but not for the mHHS (OR, 1.73; P = .081). CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of SIJ abnormalities (25.2%) is seen on imaging in FAIS patients. These patients may show significantly inferior clinical outcomes and persistent postoperative pain after FAIS treatment. The results of this study may allow treating orthopaedic surgeons to better inform patients with SIJ abnormalities that they may not achieve clinically significant outcome improvement after hip arthroscopy. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, retrospective comparative study.",
