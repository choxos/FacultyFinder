  "title": "Romosozumab in the treatment of osteoporosis.",
  "abstract": "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by weakening of the bone architecture, which leads to an increased risk of fracture. There has been interest in the development of osteoanabolic agents that can increase bone mass and reverse the deteriorating architecture of osteoporotic bone. Romosozumab is a new agent for osteoporosis that both promotes bone formation and inhibits bone resorption. It is a monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of sclerostin, which allows the Wnt pathway to promote osteoblastogenesis and inhibit the activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. In clinical trials, it has proven to be superior to other agents in terms of increasing bone mineral density and reducing the incidence of fractures. This review will highlight the pharmacology, clinical efficacy and safety profile of romosozumab and suggest where this medication may fit within our current management of osteoporosis.",
