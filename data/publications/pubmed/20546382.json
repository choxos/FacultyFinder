  "title": "Metabolic syndrome risk factors among a sample of overweight and obese Mexican children.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and correlations of components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) using the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) pediatric definition in a cross-sectional study of 215 overweight/obese Mexican children aged 6 to 12. There are no previous studies of this kind in Mexican children. Clinical, anthropometric, and laboratory measurements were performed. The prevalence of MetS using the pediatric IDF criteria was 6.7% (95% confidence interval, 4.0-11.1). A higher proportion of children in the younger age group had waist circumference above the cutoff, while a higher proportion in the older age group had hyperglycemia. Children with MetS had higher percentages of body fat, body mass index, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Increased triglycerides, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and waist circumference were most highly associated with MetS. This has significant implications for public health.",
