  "title": "Impact of seasonal blood pressure changes on visit-to-visit blood pressure variability and related cardiovascular outcomes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP) variability associates with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. We investigated the role of seasonal BP modifications on the magnitude of BP variability and its impact on cardiovascular risk. METHODS: In 25 390 patients included in the ONTARGET and TRANSCEND trials, the on-treatment systolic (S) BP values obtained by five visits during the first two years of the trials were grouped according to the month in which they were obtained. SBP differences between winter and summer months were calculated for BP variability quintiles (Qs), as quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV) of on-treatment mean SBP from the five visits. The relationship of BP variability with the risk of cardiovascular events and mortality was assessed by the Cox regression model. RESULTS: SBP was approximately 4 mmHg lower in summer than in winter regardless of confounders. Winter/summer SBP differences contributed significantly to each SBP-CV quintile. Increase of SBP-CV from Q1 to Q5 was associated with a progressive increase in the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of the primary endpoint of the trials, i.e. morbid and fatal cardiovascular events. This association was even stronger after removal of the effect of seasonality from the calculation of SBP-CV. A similar trend was observed for secondary endpoints. CONCLUSIONS: Winter/summer SBP differences significantly contribute to visit-to-visit BP variability. However, this contribution does not participate in the adverse prognostic significance of visit-to-visit BP variations, which seems to be more evident after removal of the BP effects of seasonality from visit-to-visit BP variations.",
