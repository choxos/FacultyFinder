  "title": "Proximal Row Carpectomy With Soft Tissue Interposition: A Systematic Review of Clinical Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Proximal row carpectomy (PRC) with soft tissue interposition arthroplasty (STIA) presents an alternative approach to addressing wrist arthritis patterns involving the capitate and/or lunate fossa, in lieu of wrist arthrodesis. This systematic review aimed to evaluate clinical outcomes and techniques associated with PRC-STIA in patients with advanced wrist arthritis. We conducted a systematic review using databases including PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Inclusion criteria involved articles reporting outcomes of patients who underwent PRC-STIA with at least 1 relevant outcome. The analysis encompassed 8 studies involving 106 patients (108 wrists) meeting the inclusion criteria. A majority of patients were men (69%, n = 88), with a mean age of 54.4 ± 12.7 years and an average follow-up of 4.8 ± 6.3 years. Dorsal capsule was the most commonly interposed tissue (63%, 5 out of 8 studies). Patients receiving STIA achieved comparable patient-reported outcome measures scores to those undergoing PRC alone. Postoperative pain, measured by the Visual Analog Scale, averaged 3.7 ± 0.6. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand score averaged 27.8 ± 8, while the Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation score averaged 41.5 ± 25.9. Five complications were reported in three studies. The addition of STIA into PRC for patients with capitate and/or lunate fossa cartilage degeneration yielded outcomes akin to traditional PRC, improving wrist function, pain, and grip strength in a safe and straightforward manner. Future research should prioritize high-quality comparative studies, extended follow-up periods, and standardized core outcome measures for a more comprehensive understanding of its role in wrist arthritis treatment.",
