  "abstract": "Traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) strategies are widely utilized in pediatric oncology, with many families reporting T&CM use with the intention to cure cancer. Study of T&CM agents presents many challenges, as a heterogeneous group of agents and techniques are used for a variety of different purpose in many different oncologic conditions. We present a systematic review of the literature examining published reports in which T&CM agents are used with an intention of cure. Twenty-two reports were identified, with most reports being of poor quality. Novel paradigms are likely needed to further investigate T&CM agents.",
