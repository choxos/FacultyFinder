  "title": "The burden of COVID-19 care in community and academic intensive care units in Ontario, Canada: a retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: During the COVID-19 pandemic, neighbourhoods with high material deprivation and high proportions of racialized Canadians were disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Many of these neighbourhoods were served by community hospitals. We sought to compare the burden of COVID-19 care in community and academic intensive care units (ICUs) in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We included all adult patients admitted to Ontario ICUs with COVID-19 between 1 March 2020 and 31 July 2021 in a retrospective cohort study. We compared patient volumes, demographics, interventions, and outcomes between community hospital corporations (CHCs) and academic hospital corporations (AHCs). RESULTS: During the first three waves of the pandemic, 9,651 adult ICU admissions for COVID-19 were reported across 72 hospital corporations in Ontario: 6,902 (71.5%) in CHCs and 2,749 (28.5%) in AHCs. Days of ICU care per baseline ICU bed were highest in large CHCs (> 10 baseline ICU beds) relative to AHCs and small CHCs (median [interquartile range], 73.7 [53.8-110.6] vs 42.2 [32.7-71.8] vs 21.4 [7.2-40.3]; Kruskal-Wallis test, P < 0.001). Among direct ICU admissions, CHC patients had greater severity of illness whereas among transfer ICU admissions, AHC patients were more severely ill. In a multivariable logistic regression model, mortality was similar among patients with index admission to a CHC or AHC; however, patients with index admission to an AHC were more likely to receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (adjusted odds ratio, 6.16; 95% confidence interval, 4.72 to 8.11). CONCLUSION: During the pandemic, Ontario's large CHCs provided significantly more days of ICU COVID-19 care per baseline ICU bed compared with AHCs and small CHCs. Equipping large CHCs to handle ICU surges during future emerging disease outbreaks should be a priority for pandemic preparedness.",
