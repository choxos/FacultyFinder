  "title": "Dissatisfaction With Total Knee Arthroplasty at 1 Year Post Surgery Can be Predicted Using a Short Questionnaire Early in the Recovery Process.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Approximately 20% of patients are dissatisfied with their total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Identifying patients likely to be dissatisfied early in the recovery process could help reduce the number of dissatisfied patients. The purpose of this study was to create an easily administered short questionnaire to identify patients likely to be dissatisfied at 1 year post surgery early in the recovery process. METHODS: The study included 275 patients who underwent primary TKA for osteoarthritis. Individual 3-month postsurgery questionnaire items from the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score and Knee Society Knee Scoring System were pooled together and used as candidate items to create 3 different short questionnaires. Items included in each questionnaire were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regressions, a backward elimination method, and theory-based approaches. The area under the curve for each short questionnaire was calculated to evaluate predictive performances. RESULTS: All 3 questionnaires contained a small number of items and appeared to successfully predict 1-year postsurgery dissatisfaction early in the recovery process. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, backward elimination, and theory-based questionnaires were comprised of 4, 7, and 5 items and had the area under the curve scores of 0.893, 0.902, and 0.890, respectively. A question evaluating rising from sitting and activities of daily living appeared in all of the created questionnaires. CONCLUSION: A short questionnaire that is easy to administer and interpret can effectively predict TKA patient dissatisfaction at 1 year post surgery early in the recovery process.",
