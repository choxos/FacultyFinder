  "title": "Effect of colchicine on perioperative atrial fibrillation and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery in patients undergoing major thoracic surgery (COP-AF): an international randomised trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of perioperative atrial fibrillation and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS). Colchicine is an anti-inflammatory drug that might reduce the incidence of these complications. METHODS: COP-AF was a randomised trial conducted at 45 sites in 11 countries. Patients aged 55 years or older and undergoing major non-cardiac thoracic surgery were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral colchicine 0·5 mg twice daily or matching placebo, starting within 4 h before surgery and continuing for 10 days. Randomisation was done with use of a computerised, web-based system, and was stratified by centre. Health-care providers, patients, data collectors, and adjudicators were masked to treatment assignment. The coprimary outcomes were clinically important perioperative atrial fibrillation and MINS during 14 days of follow-up. The main safety outcomes were a composite of sepsis or infection, and non-infectious diarrhoea. The intention-to-treat principle was used for all analyses. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03310125. FINDINGS: Between Feb 14, 2018, and June 27, 2023, we enrolled 3209 patients (mean age 68 years [SD 7], 1656 [51·6%] male). Clinically important atrial fibrillation occurred in 103 (6·4%) of 1608 patients assigned to colchicine, and 120 (7·5%) of 1601 patients assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0·85, 95% CI 0·65 to 1·10; absolute risk reduction [ARR] 1·1%, 95% CI -0·7 to 2·8; p=0·22). MINS occurred in 295 (18·3%) patients assigned to colchicine and 325 (20·3%) patients assigned to placebo (HR 0·89, 0·76 to 1·05; ARR 2·0%, -0·8 to 4·7; p=0·16). The composite outcome of sepsis or infection occurred in 103 (6·4%) patients in the colchicine group and 83 (5·2%) patients in the placebo group (HR 1·24, 0·93-1·66). Non-infectious diarrhoea was more common in the colchicine group (134 [8·3%] events) than the placebo group (38 [2·4%]; HR 3·64, 2·54-5·22). INTERPRETATION: In patients undergoing major non-cardiac thoracic surgery, administration of colchicine did not significantly reduce the incidence of clinically important atrial fibrillation or MINS but increased the risk of mostly benign non-infectious diarrhoea.
