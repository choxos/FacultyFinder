  "title": "Compliance with personal precautions against exposure to bloodborne pathogens among laboratory workers: a Canadian survey .",
  "abstract": "A survey was conducted in laboratories across Canada to determine rates of compliance with recommended safety precautions against exposure to bloodborne pathogens and the rationale for current behaviors. Laboratory workers reported high rates of exposure to bodily fluids and poor rates of compliance with personal protective behaviors. This national study has identified several deficiencies and strategies for improvement.",
