  "abstract": "Lymphoma with cardiac involvement is a high-risk lesion, especially in children. We report a rare clinical case of multifocal precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a child with cardiac involvement. A 4-year-old boy presented to the Vietnam National Children's Hospital with a vague headache, but magnetic resonance imaging of the head was normal. After 1 week, the patient showed symptoms of chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and abdominal pain. On transthoracic echocardiography and multislice computed tomography of the thorax, a mass was detected in the right atrial wall. Abdominal ultrasound showed a small bowel intussusception, multiple nodules in the intestinal wall, and mesenteric lymph nodes. Histopathology of the bowel confirmed the diagnosis of multifocal precursor B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The patient responded to 3 cycles of chemotherapy for lymphoma. Therefore, combining multiple imaging methods allowed for early diagnosis and improved treatment.",
