  "abstract": "\"The new frontier of robotic surgery is well under way. Current research and development is rapidly progressing, allowing for the creation of many new robotic companies. Each company has its own identity and platform for what their vision for the future entails. The competition generated between these companies will shortly be forcing newer, cheaper, more accessible robotic systems worldwide.\"",
