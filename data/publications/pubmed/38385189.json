  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Concerns have arisen that anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with lateral extra-articular tenodesis (LET) may accelerate the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment of the knee. PURPOSE/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the augmentation of ACLR with LET affects the quality of lateral compartment articular cartilage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 2 years postoperatively. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in T1rho and T2 relaxation times when comparing ACLR alone with ACLR + LET. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: A consecutive subgroup of patients at the Fowler Kennedy Sport Medicine Clinic participating in the STABILITY 1 Study underwent bilateral 3-T MRI at 2 years after surgery. The primary outcome was T1rho and T2 relaxation times. Articular cartilage in the lateral compartment was manually segmented into 3 regions of the tibia (lateral tibia [LT]-1 to LT-3) and 5 regions of the femur (lateral femoral condyle [LFC]-1 to LFC-5). Analysis of covariance was used to compare relaxation times between groups, adjusted for lateral meniscal tears and treatment, cartilage and bone marrow lesions, contralateral relaxation times, and time since surgery. Semiquantitative MRI scores according to the Anterior Cruciate Ligament OsteoArthritis Score were compared between groups. Correlations were used to determine the association between secondary outcomes (including results of the International Knee Documentation Committee score, Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Lower Extremity Functional Scale, 4-Item Pain Intensity Measure, hop tests, and isokinetic quadriceps and hamstring strength tests) and cartilage relaxation. RESULTS: A total of 95 participants (44 ACLR alone, 51 ACLR + LET) with a mean age of 18.8 years (61.1% female [58/95]) underwent 2-year MRI (range, 20-36 months). T1rho relaxation times were significantly elevated for the ACLR + LET group in LT-1 (37.3 ± 0.7 ms vs 34.1 ± 0.8 ms, respectively; P = .005) and LFC-2 (43.9 ± 0.9 ms vs 40.2 ± 1.0 ms, respectively; P = .008) compared with the ACLR alone group. T2 relaxation times were significantly elevated for the ACLR + LET group in LFC-1 (51.2 ± 0.7 ms vs 49.1 ± 0.7 ms, respectively; P = .03) and LFC-4 (45.9 ± 0.5 ms vs 44.2 ± 0.6 ms, respectively; P = .04) compared with the ACLR alone group. All effect sizes were small to medium. There was no difference in Anterior Cruciate Ligament OsteoArthritis Scores between groups (P = .99). Weak negative associations (rs = -0.27 to -0.22; P < .05) were found between relaxation times and quadriceps and hamstring strength in the anterolateral knee, while all other correlations were nonsignificant (P > .05). CONCLUSION: Increased relaxation times demonstrating small to medium effect sizes suggested early biochemical changes in articular cartilage of the anterolateral compartment in the ACLR + LET group compared with the ACLR alone group. Further evidence and long-term follow-up are needed to better understand the association between these results and the potential risk of the development of osteoarthritis in our patient cohort.",
