  "title": "An Assessment of National Strategic Action Plans for Viral Hepatitis Elimination, 2016-2021.",
  "abstract": "In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) released the Global Health Sector Strategy (GHSS) setting goals for global hepatitis elimination. To inform new or revised viral hepatitis national strategic action plans (NSAPs) for 2022-2030, NSAPs developed during 2016-2021 were assessed for alignment with the WHO GHSS. Country NSAPs were assessed to determine if they included components in the 2016 GHSS. Of 55 country NSAPs, 19 (35%) did not include hepatitis B and C virus elimination goals, only 18 (33%) included targets for needles and syringes for persons who inject drugs, and 21 (38%) had a national budget or financing plan for hepatitis activities. Gaps identified indicate need for technical support in NSAP development.",
