  "title": "Altered secretion patterns and cell wall organization caused by loss of PodB function in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans.",
  "abstract": "Filamentous fungi are widely used in the production of a variety of industrially relevant enzymes and proteins as they have the unique ability to secrete tremendous amounts of proteins. However, the secretory pathways in filamentous fungi are not completely understood. Here, we investigated the role of a mutation in the POlarity Defective (podB) gene on growth, protein secretion, and cell wall organization in Aspergillus nidulans using a temperature sensitive (Ts) mutant. At restrictive temperature, the mutation resulted in lack of biomass accumulation, but led to a significant increase in specific protein productivity. Proteomic analysis of the secretome showed that the relative abundance of 584 (out of 747 identified) proteins was altered due to the mutation. Of these, 517 were secreted at higher levels. Other phenotypic differences observed in the mutant include up-regulation of unfolded protein response (UPR), deformation of Golgi apparatus and uneven cell wall thickness. Furthermore, proteomic analysis of cell wall components in the mutant revealed the presence of intracellular proteins in higher abundance accompanied by lower levels of most cell wall proteins. Taken together, results from this study suggest the importance of PodB as a target when engineering fungal strains for enhanced secretion of valuable biomolecules.",
