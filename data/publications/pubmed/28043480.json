  "title": "The Integrated Comprehensive Care Program: A Novel Home Care Initiative After Major Thoracic Surgery.",
  "abstract": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the Integrated Comprehensive Care (ICC) program, a novel health system integration initiative that coordinates home care and hospital-based clinical services for patients undergoing major thoracic surgery relative to traditional home care delivery. Methods included a pilot retrospective cohort analysis that compared the intervention cohort (ICC), composed of all patients undergoing major thoracic surgery in the 2012-2013 fiscal year with a control cohort, who underwent surgery in the year before the initiation of ICC. Length of stay, hospital costs, readmission, and emergency room visit data were stratified by degree and approach of resection and compared using univariate logistic regression analysis. A total of 331 patients under ICC and 355 control patients were enrolled. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in patients under video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) ICC (sublobar median 3 vs 4 days, P = 0.013; lobar median 4 vs 5 days, P = 0.051) but not for open resections. The frequency of emergency room visits within 60 days of surgery was lower for all stratification groups in the ICC cohort, except for VATS sublobar (25.7% control vs 13.9% ICC, P = 0.097). There were no significant differences in 60-day readmission frequency in any subcohort. The mean inpatient case cost was significantly lower for ICC VATS sublobar resections ($8505.39 vs $11,038.18, P = 0.007), with the other resection types trending lower for ICC but nonsignificant. In conclusion, a hospital-based, postdischarge, patient-centered program could potentially result in shorter hospital stay, fewer readmission and emergency room visits, costsavings, and no increase in adverse postdischarge outcomes after major thoracic surgery.",
