  "title": "Role of regional anesthesia in the ambulatory environment.",
  "abstract": "The use of local anesthetics in ambulatory surgery offers multiple benefits in line with the goals of modern-day outpatient surgery. A variety of regional techniques can be used for a wide spectrum of procedures; all are shown to reduce postprocedural pain; reduce the short-term need for opiate medications; reduce adverse effects, such as nausea and vomiting; and reduce the time to dismissal compared with patients who do not receive regional techniques. Growth in ambulatory procedures will likely continue to rise with future advances in surgical techniques, changes in reimbursement, and the evolution of clinical pathways that include superior, sustained postoperative analgesia. Anticipating these changes in practice, the role of, and demand for, regional anesthesia in outpatient surgery will continue to grow.",
