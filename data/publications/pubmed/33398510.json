  "title": "Is diversion free ileal pouch-anal anastomosis a safe procedure? A meta-analysis of 4973 cases.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) has been established as the procedure of choice for patients who require excision of the colon and rectum for familial adenomatous polyposis and ulcerative colitis. The requirement for proximal stomal diversion in IPAA is controversial. OBJECTIVES: To compare post-operative outcomes following IPAA with and without proximal diversion. METHODS: Computerised literature search, of Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE. Full-text comparative studies published between 1992 and 2019, in English language and on adult patients. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with or without proximal stomal diversion following proctocolectomy. Outcome measures were anastomotic leak, anastomosis strictures, re-operations, pouch failure, intra-abdominal sepsis, small bowel obstruction/ileus and mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred and forty-six studies were screened. Fourteen relevant studies included 4973 cases (1832 patients with no stomas vs 3141 with stomas). Anastomotic strictures (p ≤ 0.0001 OR 0.40; 95% CI (0.26-0.62)) and pouch failures (p = 0.003 OR 0.54; 95% CI (0.36-0.82)) were higher in diverted than non-diverted patients. Re-operation was more frequently required in non-diverted patients (p = 0.02 OR 2.51; 95% CI (1.12-5.59)). Heterogeneity was low in 5 out of 7 variables. CONCLUSION: In selected patients, diversion-free IPAA is a safe procedure associated with lower anastomotic stricture and pouch failure rates than diverted IPAA. This appears to occur at the expense of a higher re-operation rate. An RCT is required to help define the selection criteria.",
