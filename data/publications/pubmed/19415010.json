  "abstract": "AIMS: To identify clinical features at presentation to help in detecting patients with retinoblastoma and pathology risk factors (PRFs) preoperatively, and therefore selecting a high-risk population that could benefit from preoperative treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively filled form of 182 consecutive patients with unilateral retinoblastoma treated with initial enucleation from 1988 to 2006. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out. Major choroidal invasion and postlaminar optic nerve and scleral extension were considered PRFs. Within this subgroup, a higher-risk cohort (microscopical residual disease caused by trans-scleral invasion or invasion to the resection margin of the optic nerve) was analyzed separately. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four patients had completely resected and 18 had microscopical residual disease. Seventy three had at least 1 PRF (massive invasion to the choroid in 25, to the postlaminar optic nerve in 41, intrascleral in 10, to the resection margin of the optic nerve in 12, and trans-scleral in 6). Seventy-one patients had glaucoma and 19 had buphthalmia. Intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and buphthalmia correlated significantly with the occurrence of both PRF and microscopical residual disease in multivariate analysis. Buphthalmia was the most specific factor but the sensitivity was lower. Glaucoma and buphthalmia had a high negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Patients presenting with glaucoma and/or buphthalmia have a significantly higher risk for the occurrence of PRF, including those resulting in microscopically residual disease.",
