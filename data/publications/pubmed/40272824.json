  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is associated with increased perioperative mortality; however, the incidence and prognostic impact of MINS after major head and neck surgery remains uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence and clinical implications of MINS in patients after major head and neck surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study used data from the VISION (Vascular Events in Noncardiac Surgery Patients Cohort Evaluation; 2017) study, an international prospective cohort study that analyzed more than 35 000 patients who had noncardiac surgery. Of those, 648 patients (1.8%) underwent major head and neck surgery requiring at least 1-day hospital admission and screening for MINS via troponin T (TnT) concentrations measured during the first 3 postoperative days. MINS was defined as a high-sensitivity TnT (hsTnT) of 20 to 64 ng/L and absolute change more than 5 ng/L or hsTnT 65 ng/L or greater (ie, fifth-generation assay) and cardiac ischemia. When using fourth-generation assay, MINS was defined as non-hsTNT 0.04 ng/mL or greater and cardiac ischemia. Data analyses were performed from October to December 2024. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: MINS incidence and its association with 30-day mortality. All clinical outcomes were analyzed using Cox regression models and length of hospital stay (LOHS) was analyzed using multivariable linear regression. RESULTS: Among 648 patients (265 [40.9%] female and 383 [59.1%] male; 376 [58.0%] aged 45 to 64 years), the incidence of MINS after major head and neck surgery was 11.9% (95% CI, 9.39%-14.4%), rising to 23.8% (95% CI, 15.7%-32%) among those aged 75 years or older. MINS occurred more often in patients with medical comorbidities. The proportion of MINS that would have gone undetected without TnT monitoring was 68.8% (95% CI, 57.3%-78.9%). In this cohort, 30-day and 1-year mortality were 1.9% (95% CI, 0.8%-2.9%) and 13.1% (95% CI, 10.5%-15.7%), respectively. MINS was associated with increased 30-day mortality (hazard ratio, 5.51; 95% CI, 1.75-17.36) and prolonged LOHS in patients with MINS with at least 1 ischemic feature (adjusted β, 3.15 days; 95% CI, 1.47-6.76 days). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study found that myocardial injury was common among patients undergoing major head and neck surgery, especially those aged 75 years or older and those with comorbidities. Nearly 70% of MINS cases go undetected without TnT monitoring, and MINS may contribute to worse 30-day postoperative mortality and prolonged LOHS. Further prospective validation is needed to evaluate the role of MINS screening in improving clinical outcomes after major head and neck surgery.",
