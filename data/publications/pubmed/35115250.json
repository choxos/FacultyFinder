  "title": "Economic Analysis of a Diabetes Health Coaching Intervention for Adults Living With Type 2 Diabetes: A Single-Centre Evaluation From a Community-Based Randomized Controlled Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A recent randomized controlled trial demonstrated that a community-based, telephone-delivered diabetes health coaching intervention was effective for improving diabetes management. Our aim in this study was to determine whether this intervention is also cost-effective. METHODS: An economic evaluation, in the form of a cost-utility analysis (CUA), was used to assess the cost-effectiveness of the coaching intervention from a public payer's perspective. All direct medical costs, as well as intervention implementation, were included. The outcome measure for the CUA was quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Uncertainty of cost-effectiveness results was estimated using nonparametric bootstraps of patient-level costs and QALYs in the coaching and control arms. A cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was used to express this uncertainty as the probability that diabetes health coaching is cost-effective across a range of values of willingness-to-pay thresholds for a QALY. RESULTS: The results show that subjects in the coaching arm incurred higher overall costs (in Canadian dollars) than subjects in the control arm ($1,581 vs $1,086, respectively) and incurred 0.02 more QALYs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the diabetes health coaching intervention compared with usual care was found to be $35,129 per QALY, with probabilities of 67% and 82% that diabetes health coaching would be cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $50,000 per QALY and $100,000 per QALY, respectively. CONCLUSION: A community-based, telephone-delivered diabetes health coaching intervention is cost-effective.",
