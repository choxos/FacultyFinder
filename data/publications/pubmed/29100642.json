  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary valve replacement is becoming the most frequent congenital heart surgery performed on adolescents and young adults. Numerous surgical options are available, including autologous pericardium, mechanical valves, allografts, and bioprosthetic valves. Each option has limitations with durability and freedom from reintervention for stenosis or insufficiency, particularly in the pediatric population. The purpose of this study was to analyze our uniquely designed, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) valved conduit (VC) for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. METHODS: Beginning in 2012, ePTFE VC were implanted in 26 patients with a median age of 9.8 years (range, 1.0 to 15.9). Bicuspid VC were used in the first 3 patients, and tricuspid VC were used in 23 patients. The ePTFE VC is fashioned from commercially available ePTFE tube graft (16 mm in 1 patient, 20 mm in 7 patients, 24 mm in 18 patients) and 0.1 mm thick ePTFE membrane for the leaflet material. Valve function was assessed by echocardiogram after the implantation. RESULTS: There were no postoperative hospital deaths. Mean follow-up was 2.6 years (range, 4 months to 4.7 years), and there have been no reoperations for the ePTFE VC. There was one reintervention for stenosis at the distal anastomosis. Pulmonary insufficiency was mild or less in 24 patients (92%). The average peak instantaneous pressure gradient between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery was 22.4 Â± 15.1 mm Hg at latest follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with historical data for other pulmonary valve replacement options, our ePTFE VC shows superior medium-term performance, with less reintervention or significant valve dysfunction.",
