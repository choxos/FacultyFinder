  "title": "Strategies for Dealing with Missing Accelerometer Data.",
  "abstract": "Missing data is a universal research problem that can affect studies examining the relationship between physical activity measured with accelerometers and health outcomes. Statistical techniques are available to deal with missing data; however, available techniques have not been synthesized. A scoping review was conducted to summarize the advantages and disadvantages of identified methods of dealing with missing data from accelerometers. Missing data poses a threat to the validity and interpretation of trials using physical activity data from accelerometry. Imputation using multiple imputation techniques is recommended to deal with missing data and improve the validity and interpretation of studies using accelerometry.",
