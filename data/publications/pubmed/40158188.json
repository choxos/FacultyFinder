  "title": "Standard of care in advanced HIV disease: review of HIV treatment guidelines in sub-Saharan African countries-an extension study of eight countries.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organization (WHO) has published guidelines for the management of patients with advanced HIV disease (AHD) but mortality remains high. Adoption of WHO recommendations by national guidelines is poorly documented. We aimed to extend our prior review of six national management guidelines by including additional countries from sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We identified guidelines of eight additional countries participating in a multicountry trial of azithromycin prophylaxis for AHD. Data was extracted in five domains including definition of AHD (1 item), screening (6 items), prophylaxis (6 items), supportive care (1 items), and HIV treatment (4 items) and scored agreement of each national guideline with the WHO guidelines. RESULTS: Six of the eight national guidelines had a designated section for AHD. Compared with the WHO guideline, the agreement score for national guidelines was between 7 and 17 out of 18, whereby disagreement is mainly driven by missing information. None of the national guidelines had more than three items not in agreement with the WHO guidelines, and the maximum number of items not addressed by any one guideline was eight. Main areas of disagreement were the targeted population for start of ART in presence of tuberculosis meningitis (1/8 in agreement) and urine lipoarabinomannan screening (2/8 in agreement). The targeted population group for cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and its discontinuation was in line with the WHO recommendations in 3/8 national guidelines. Except one guideline, all documents showed similar overall agreement, irrespectively of publication date. CONCLUSION: National guidelines for the management of people with AHD are broadly in agreement with WHO guidelines. Main areas of disagreement are recommendations regarding urine lipoarabinomannan screening, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis and start of antiretroviral therapy in presence of tuberculosis.",
