  "title": "Incident Fragility Fractures Have a Long-Term Negative Impact on Health-Related Quality of Life of Older People: The Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study.",
  "abstract": "Although the short-term impact of incident fragility fractures on health-related quality of life (HRQL) of older people has been confirmed, we lack long-term evidence. We explored the impact of incident fragility fractures on HRQL, among people aged 50 years and older, using 10-year prospective data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study (CaMos). This study was based on data from 7753 (2187 men and 5566 women) participants of CaMos. The HRQL, measured through the Health Utility Index (HUI), was captured at baseline and year 10. The incident fragility fractures were recorded over 10 years of follow-up at spine, hip, rib, shoulder, pelvis, or forearm. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to measure the mean difference, termed as deficit, in the HUI scores for participants with and without fractures. We examined the effects of single or multiple fragility fractures, time (fractures that occurred between year 1 to 5 and 6 to 10) and recovery to the prefracture level. Incident spine and hip fractures were associated with significant deficits (varied from -0.19 to -0.07) on the HUI scores. Hip and spine fractures were associated with negative impact on mobility, self-care, and ambulation. Fractures that occurred closer to the follow-up assessment were associated with significant impact on HRQL compared to fractures occurring a long time before it, except for hip fracture (deficits lasted 5 years or longer). Similarly, multiple hip (-0.14), spine (-0.16), and rib (-0.21) fractures significantly impacted the HRQL of women. Women with a hip fracture never recovered to their prefracture level score (OR = 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). Our analysis suggests that single and multiple hip fractures as well as multiple spine and rib fractures strongly impact the HRQL of older people over a prolonged period of time.
