  "title": "Gut-joint axis in knee synovitis: gut fungal dysbiosis and altered fungi-bacteria correlation network identified in a community-based study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Knee synovitis is a highly prevalent and potentially curable condition for knee pain; however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. We sought to assess the associations of the gut fungal microbiota and the fungi-bacteria correlation network with knee synovitis. METHODS: Participants were derived from a community-based cross-sectional study. We performed an ultrasound examination of both knees. A knee was defined as having synovitis if its synovium was ≥4 mm and/or Power Doppler (PD) signal was within the knee synovium area (PD synovitis). We collected faecal specimens from each participant and assessed gut fungal and bacterial microbiota using internal transcribed spacer 2 and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We examined the relation of α-diversity, β-diversity, the relative abundance of taxa and the interkingdom correlations to knee synovitis. RESULTS: Among 977 participants (mean age: 63.2 years; women: 58.8%), 191 (19.5%) had knee synovitis. β-diversity of the gut fungal microbiota, but not α-diversity, was significantly associated with prevalent knee synovitis. The fungal genus Schizophyllum was inversely correlated with the prevalence and activity (ie, control, synovitis without PD signal and PD synovitis) of knee synovitis. Compared with those without synovitis, the fungi-bacteria correlation network in patients with knee synovitis was smaller (nodes: 93 vs 153; edges: 107 vs 244), and the average number of neighbours was fewer (2.3 vs 3.2). CONCLUSION: Alterations of gut fungal microbiota and the fungi-bacteria correlation network are associated with knee synovitis. These novel findings may help understand the mechanisms of the gut-joint axis in knee synovitis and suggest potential targets for future treatment.",
