  "title": "Effects of optical clearing agents on noninvasive blood glucose monitoring with optical coherence tomography: a pilot study.",
  "abstract": "Recently, the capability of optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been demonstrated for noninvasive blood glucose monitoring. In this work, we investigate the administration of chemical agents onto human skin tissue to increase the transparency of the surface of the skin, as a means of improving the capability of OCT imaging for clinically relevant applications. Eight groups of experiments were proposed, in which different optical clearing agents (OCA) were used. The results indicate that, when properly used, some OCAs perform well in promoting the capability of OCT for noninvasive blood glucose monitoring. Among the four kinds of OCA we used, 50% v/v glycerol solute turns out to be the best enhancer. Compared with the results of the experiments in which no OCA was used, when 50% glycerol was applied onto the human skin topically, the correlation coefficient between the OCT signal slope (OCTSS) and blood glucose concentration (BGC) was improved by 7.1% on average, and the lag time between changes in the OCTSS and BGC was cut by 8 min on average. The results of 10 w/v mannitol were also good, but not as pronounced.",
