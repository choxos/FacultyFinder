  "title": "Safety of Early Mobilization in Patients With Intraoperative Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak in Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery: A Case Series.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak is a common complication in spine surgery. Repairing durotomy is more difficult in the setting of minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS). Efficacy of postoperative bed rest in case of dural tear in MISS is not clear. OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of our protocol of dura closure without changing access, early mobilization, and discharge in cases of intraoperative CSF leak in MISS. METHODS: A retrospective review from 2006 to 2018 of patients who underwent MISS for degenerative and neoplastic diseases with documented accidental or intentional durotomy was conducted. The primary outcome of interest was readmission rate for repair of persistent CSF leak. Secondary outcomes captured included development of pseudomeningocele, positional headache, and subdural hematoma. RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were identified out of 527 patients. Of these, intentional durotomy was performed in 28 patients and unintentional durotomy occurred in 52 patients. Mean follow-up period was 80.6 mo. Most of the patients were discharged on postoperative day 0 (within 4 h of surgery) without activity restrictions. A total of 2 (2.5%) patients required readmission and dural repair for continuous CSF leak and 3 patients (3.75%) developed pseudomeningocele. No lumbar drain insertion, meningitis, or subdural hematoma was reported. CONCLUSION: Early mobilization and discharge in cases of intraoperative CSF leak in MISS appear to be safe and not associated with higher rate of complications than that of reported literature.",
