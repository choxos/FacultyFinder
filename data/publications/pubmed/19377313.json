  "title": "University collaboration in delivering applied health and nursing services research training.",
  "abstract": "In 2001-2002, the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation (CHSRF) and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) committed 10 years of funding for the creation and implementation of three Regional Training Centres to build capacity in health services and policy research in the Atlantic, Ontario and Western regions of Canada and one training centre in Quebec to focus on the development of nursing services researchers. Each RTC comprises several universities that collaborate to deliver the graduate training. The authors of this paper describe the consortium-related features of the RTCs, including approval processes, formal agreements, governance, communication, students, curriculum, administration and use of educational technology. The discussion outlines the benefits and challenges of university collaboration for participating students, faculty and universities and summarizes lessons learned.",
