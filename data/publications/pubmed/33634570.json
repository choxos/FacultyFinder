  "title": "Comparison of guidelines for the management of hypertension: Similarities and differences between international and Asian countries; perspectives from HOPE-Asia Network.",
  "abstract": "Guidelines on the management of hypertension have been developed by various professional bodies and institutions to primarily address the issues of diagnosis, treatment, and control in order to rationalize and improve the management of hypertension. Hypertension guidelines across the world have recently been updated following the new and controversial lower blood pressure threshold of â‰¥130/80 mmHg for the diagnosis of hypertension adopted by the Americans. While there are differences between the major as well as between the Asian national guidelines, there were also many similarities. This paper discusses and highlights the differences and similarities between the major international guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, of the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension, and of the International Society of Hypertension and also compares them with the Asian guidelines.",
