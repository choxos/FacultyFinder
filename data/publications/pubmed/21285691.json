  "title": "A case of periostitis secondary to voriconazole therapy in a heart transplant recipient.",
  "abstract": "A 66-year-old man with a history of heart transplant for idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy presented with progressive bone pain and myalgias. He has been on voriconazole for a pulmonary Aspergillus infection for 9 months. He had an elevated alkaline phosphatase of 280. There is no history of rheumatologic disease. Drug-induced periostitis has recently been reported in patients on long-term voriconazole therapy after lung transplantation for prophylaxis and treatment of Aspergillus infection. This case demonstrates the same phenomenon in a heart transplant patient. This patient's symptoms improved after discontinuation of voriconazole.",
