  "title": "Placental microphysiological systems: new advances on promising platforms that mimic the microenvironment of the human placenta.",
  "abstract": "One of the most complex human physiological processes to study is pregnancy. Standard animal models, as well as two-dimensional models, lack the complexity and biological relevance required to accurately study such a physiological process. Recent studies have focused on the development of three-dimensional models based on microfluidic systems, designated as placental microphysiological systems (PMPSs). PMPS devices provide a model of the placental barrier through culturing relevant cell types in specific arrangements and media to mimic the in vivo environment of the maternal-fetal circulation. Here, recent developments of PMPS models for embryo uterine implantation, preeclampsia evaluation, and toxicological screening are presented. Studies that use bioprinting techniques are also discussed. Lastly, recent developments in endometrium microphysiological systems are reviewed. All these presented models showed their superiority compared to standard models in recapitulating the biological environment seen in vivo. However, several limitations regarding the types of cells and materials used for these systems were also widely reported. Despite the need for further improvements, PMPS models contribute to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms surrounding pregnancy and the respective pathologies.",
