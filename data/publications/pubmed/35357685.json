  "title": "The associations of psoas and masseter muscles with sarcopenia and related adverse outcomes in older trauma patients: a retrospective study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is an emerging role for radiological evaluation of psoas muscle as a marker of sarcopenia in trauma patients. Older trauma patients are more likely to undergo cranial than abdomino-pelvic imaging. Identifying sarcopenia using masseter cross-sectional area (M-CSA) has shown correlation with mortality. We sought to determine the correlation between psoas: lumbar vertebral index (PLVI) and the M-CSA, and their association with health outcomes. METHODS: Patients aged 65 or above, who presented as a trauma call over a 1-year period were included if they underwent cranial or abdominal CT imaging. Images were retrospectively analysed to obtain PLVI and mean M-CSA measurements. Electronic records were abstracted for outcomes. Logistic regression methods, log scale analyses, Cox regression model and Kaplan-Meier plots were used to determine association of sarcopenia with outcomes. RESULTS: There were 155 eligible patients in the M-CSA group and 204 patients in the PLVI group. Sarcopenia was defined as the lowest quartile in each group. Pearson's correlation indicated a weakly positive linear relationship (r = 0.35, p < 0.001) between these. There was no statistical association between M-CSA sarcopenia status and any measured outcomes. Those with PLVI sarcopenia were more likely to die in hospital (adjusted OR 3.38, 95% CI 1.47-9.73, p = 0.006) and at 2 years (adjusted HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.11-3.25, p = 0.02). Only 29% patients with PLVI sarcopenia were discharged home, compared with 58% without sarcopenia (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Sarcopenia, defined by PLVI, is predictive of increased in-patient and 2-year mortality. Our study did not support prognostic relevance of M-CSA.",
