  "title": "Designing and implementing a comparative effectiveness study of two strategies for delivering high quality CHD prevention: methods and participant characteristics for the Heart to Health study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although lifestyle and medications are effective for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk reduction, few studies have examined the comparative effectiveness of various strategies for delivering high quality CHD risk reduction. In this paper, we report on the design and baseline characteristics of participants for just such a trial. METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of the same lifestyle and medication intervention delivered in two alternate formats: counselor-delivered or web-based. The trial was conducted at 5 diverse practices in a family medicine research network and included men and women age 35-79 who were at high risk of CHD events based on 10-year predicted Framingham risk of â‰¥10% or a known history of cardiovascular disease. After individual-level randomization, participants in both arms received a decision aid plus four intensive intervention visits and 3 maintenance visits over 12 months. The primary outcome was change in 10-year predicted CHD risk among patients without prior cardiovascular disease. Secondary outcomes, measured among all participants, included changes in CHD risk factors, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability at 4 and 12-month follow-up. RESULTS: We randomized 489 eligible patients: 389 without and 100 with a known history of cardiovascular disease. Mean age was 62.3. 75% were white, 25% African-American. 45% had a college education. 88% had health insurance. Mean 10-year predicted CHD risk was 16.9%. CONCLUSION: We have successfully recruited a diverse sample of practices and patients that will provide a rich sample in which to test the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to implement high quality CHD prevention.",
