  "title": "Psychometric Evaluation of a Revised Scoring Approach for the Children's Saving Inventory in a Canadian Sample of Youth With Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder.",
  "abstract": "The Children's Saving Inventory (CSI) was introduced in 2011 and is the first parent-rated questionnaire specifically designed to measure the severity of hoarding symptoms in youth. To date, however, no replication studies of the CSI have been published. Additionally, the total CSI score includes several items measuring acquisition, a behavioural dimension that has since been excluded from DSM-5's hoarding disorder criteria. Given these limitations, the primary goal of the present study was to test a modified, DSM-5-consistent, total score of the CSI. Because a confirmatory factor analysis did not support the 2011 four-factor model of the CSI, we reviewed the original CSI and excluded all acquisition items. An exploratory factor analysis yielded a strong three-factor solution (difficulty discarding, Clutter, and distress/impairment) with good reliability and validity for a 15-item version of the CSI. Overall, our results support the use of the 15-item CSI in youth with OCD.",
