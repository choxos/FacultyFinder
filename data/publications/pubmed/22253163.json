  "abstract": "We retrospectively studied clinical and etiological profile of acute bacterial meningitis in hospitalized children for two consecutive years at a pediatric hospital in western Uttar Pradesh. Etiological diagnosis could be made in 30 (44.8%) out of 67 cases with either culture or latex agglutination test. Pneumococcus was the commonest pathogen found in 17 (25.4%) cases. The overall mortality was 10.5%.",
