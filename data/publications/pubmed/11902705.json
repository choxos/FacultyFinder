  "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is a common viral illness affecting almost all children within their first few years of life. In most young children, RSV results in a mild respiratory infection. It is, however, the single most important cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonitis in infancy and contributes to significant morbidity and even mortality in a subset of high-risk children. There are new developments in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of RSV infection in infants and children. Early recognition of young children at high risk for severe RSV infection and apnea can help to minimize the morbidity and mortality.",
