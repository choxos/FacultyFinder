  "abstract": "Hand fractures represent commonly encountered injuries in pediatric patients. However, due to modern means of mobility and product safety, the occurrence and distribution of these fractures have changed during the last decades. Therefore, it was the aim of this study to present an update of the epidemiology, pattern, and treatment of hand fractures in a large pediatric cohort. All patients aged between 0 and 17 years treated in our Department in 2019 with fractures of the phalanges, metacarpus, or carpus were included. The medical records were reviewed for age, gender, injury mechanism, fracture localization, season, and treatment. Patients were divided into three different age groups (0-5, 6-12, and 13-17 years). A total of 731 patients with 761 hand fractures were treated during the 1-year study period. The mean age was 11.1 ± 3.5 years, and the majority was male (65%). Male patients were significantly older compared to female patients (p = 0.008). Also, 78.7% of the fractures affected the phalanges, 17.6% the metacarpals, and 3.7% the carpal bones. The proximal phalanges were the most commonly fractured bones (41.5%). Patients with fractures of the carpus were significantly older compared to children sustaining fractures of the metacarpus or phalangeal bones (p < 0.001). Sixteen percent of our patients were treated surgically; these patients were significantly older compared to conservatively treated patients (p = 0.011). Conclusion: The epidemiology, mechanisms of injury, distribution, and treatment of hand fractures significantly varies among different age groups. This knowledge is of importance for educational purposes of younger colleagues entrusted with care of children and adolescents as well as development of effective prevention strategies. What is Known: • Pediatric hand fractures represent the second most common fractures in children. • The epidemiology of pediatric hand fractures has changed during the last decades and therefore there is a need for an update regarding distribution and epidemiology of pediatric hand fractures. What is New: • In this retrospective cohort study, 761 pediatric hand fractures of 731 patients were analyzed in detail. • The main mechanisms of younger patients were entrapment injuries, older children most commonly sustained their fractures due to ball sport injuries. There was an increasing rate of metacarpal and carpal fractures with increasing age, and these fractures had to be treated operatively more often than phalangeal fractures.",
