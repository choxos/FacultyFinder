  "title": "Benralizumab for allergic asthma: a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Benralizumab induces rapid and near-complete depletion of eosinophils from blood and lung tissue. We investigated whether benralizumab could attenuate the allergen-induced late asthmatic response (LAR) in participants with allergic asthma. METHODS: Participants with allergic asthma who demonstrated increased sputum eosinophils and LAR at screening were randomised to benralizumab 30 mg or matched placebo given every 4 weeks for 8 weeks (3 doses). Allergen challenges were performed at weeks 9 and 12 when blood, sputum, bone marrow and bronchial tissue eosinophils and LAR were assessed. RESULTS: 46 participants (mean age 30.9 years) were randomised to benralizumab (n=23) or placebo (n=23). Eosinophils were significantly reduced in the benralizumab group compared with placebo in blood at 4 weeks and sputum and bone marrow at 9 weeks after treatment initiation. At 7 h after an allergen challenge at week 9, sputum eosinophilia was significantly attenuated in the benralizumab group compared to placebo (least squares mean difference -5.81%, 95% CI -10.69- -0.94%; p=0.021); however, the LAR was not significantly different (least squares mean difference 2.54%, 95% CI 3.05-8.12%; p=0.363). Adverse events were reported for seven (30.4%) and 14 (60.9%) participants in the benralizumab and placebo groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Benralizumab administration over 8 weeks resulted in a significant attenuation of blood, bone marrow and sputum eosinophilia in participants with mild allergic asthma; however, there was no change in the LAR, suggesting that eosinophils alone are not a key component of allergen-induced bronchoconstriction.",
