  "title": "Determinants of socioemotional and behavioral well-being among First Nations children living off-reserve in Canada: A cross-sectional study.",
  "abstract": "Few studies have focused on off-reserve Indigenous children and families. This nationally representative, cross-sectional study (data collected from 2006 to 2007) examined Indigenous- and non-Indigenous-specific determinants associated with positive socioemotional and behavioral well-being among First Nations children living off-reserve in Canada. The parents or other caregivers of 2990 two-to-five-year-old children (M = 3.65; 50.6% male) reported on their children's socioemotional and behavioral well-being and a range of child, parent, and housing characteristics. Being taught an Indigenous culture, greater community cohesion, caregiver nurturance, good parental/other caregiver health, and fewer household members were associated with better socioemotional and behavioral well-being. These results highlight the importance of leveraging Indigenous-specific determinants and acknowledging non-Indigenous-specific factors, to promote the well-being of First Nations children living off-reserve.",
