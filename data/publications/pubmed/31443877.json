  "title": "Psychotropic Medication for Children and Adolescents with Eating Disorders.",
  "abstract": "Psychotropic medications are commonly used in the treatment of eating disorders in children and adolescents. This article reviews the evidence base on psychotropic medications, including all randomized trials, uncontrolled trials, and case reports for the treatment of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, other specified feeding and eating disorders, binge-eating disorder, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Despite advances in the number of medication-based studies completed in young patients with eating disorders over the last 2 decades, significantly more work needs to be done in terms of identifying what role, if any, psychotropic medications can have on treatment outcomes.",
