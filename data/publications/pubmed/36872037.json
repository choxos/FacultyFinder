  "title": "Editorial Commentary: A Patient-Specific Approach to Preventing Venous Thromboembolism After Hip Arthroscopy Is Essential.",
  "abstract": "The incidence of hip arthroscopy (HA) has seen a dramatic rise over the past decade, with a bimodal distribution of patient age with peaks at both 18 and 42 years of age. Thus, it is essential to reduce complications, including venous thromboembolism (VTE), given reported incidences as high as 7%. Fortunately, more recent research, perhaps reflecting an evolution resulting in lower HA surgical traction times, has shown a VTE incidence of 0.6%. Perhaps because of such a low rate, recent research has also shown that generally, thromboprophylaxis does not significantly decrease the odds of VTE. The strongest predictors of VTE after HA are oral contraceptive use, prior malignancy, and obesity. Rehabilitation is also an important factor as some patients are ambulatory on postoperative day 1, reducing the VTE risk, whereas others require a few weeks of protected weight bearing, increasing their risk. A patient-specific approach to VTE prevention after HA, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, is essential.",
