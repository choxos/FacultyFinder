  "title": "Health TAPESTRY Ontario: protocol for a randomized controlled trial to test reproducibility and implementation.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Health TAPESTRY (Health Teams Advancing Patient Experience: STRengthening qualitY) aims to help people stay healthier for longer where they live by providing person-focused care through the integration of four key program components: (1) trained volunteers who visit clients in their homes, (2) an interprofessional primary health care team, (3) use of technology to collect and share information, and (4) improved connections to community health and social services. The initial randomized controlled trial of Health TAPESTRY found promising results in terms of health care use and patient outcomes, indicating a shift from reactive to preventive care. The trial was based on one clinical academic center, thus limiting generalizability. The study objectives are (1) to test reproducibility of the established effectiveness of Health TAPESTRY on physical activity and hospitalizations, (2) to test the feasibility of, and understand the contributing factors to, the implementation of Health TAPESTRY in six diverse communities across Ontario, Canada, and (3) to determine the value for money of implementing Health TAPESTRY. METHODS: This planned study is a pragmatic parallel randomized controlled trial with a delayed intervention for control participants at 6 months. This trial will simultaneously assess effectiveness and implementation in a real-world setting (type II hybrid) in six diverse communities across Ontario. Participants 70 years of age and older will be randomized into the Health TAPESTRY intervention or the control group (usual care). Intervention clients will receive an individualized plan of care from an interprofessional care team. The plan will be based on a client's goals and current health risks identified through volunteer visits. The study's outcomes are mapped onto the RE-AIM framework, with levels of physical activity and number of hospitalizations as the co-primary outcomes. The main analysis will be a comparison at 6 months. DISCUSSION: It is important to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of Health TAPESTRY in multiple communities prior to scaling or widespread adoption. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03397836 . Registered on 12 January 2018.",
