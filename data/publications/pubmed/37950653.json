  "title": "Impact of Care-Recipient Relationship Type on Quality of Life in Community-Dwelling Older Adults With Dementia Over Time.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Maintaining quality of life (QoL) has been identified as the primary goal of care services for person living with dementia (PLWD). METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted on five rounds of the National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS) over 4 years. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to examine the prediction of relationship type on older adults' QoL through four domains: mental health, general health, functional limitations, and pain. RESULTS: older adults cared for by an adult-child or multiple caregivers predicted increased risk for functional limitations after adjustment for their socio-demographic and dementia status (IRR = 1.53, CI [1.26, 1.86]; IRR = 1.36, CI [1.14, 1.61], respectively). The interaction between the relationship type and education was significant. Older adults with a high school education or below, who were cared for by an adult child, had a significantly higher risk of increasing functional limitations over 4 years compared to those cared for by a spouse/partner (contrast = .50, P = .01, 95% CI [.07, .93]; contrast=.52, P = .03, 95% CI [.03, 1.02]; respectively). Similarly, older adults with a high school education, who were cared for by multiple caregivers, also experienced a significantly higher risk of increasing functional limitations than those cared for by a spouse/partner (contrast = .44, P = .03, 95% CI [.02, .85]). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of the significant contribution of relationship type on PLWD's QoL changes over time. They also help to prioritize resource allocation while addressing PLWD's demands by socio-demographics such as education level.",
