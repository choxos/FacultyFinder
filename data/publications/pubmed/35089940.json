  "abstract": "The uropathogens is the main cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of the study was to isolate bacteria from urine samples of UTI patients and find out the susceptibility of isolated bacteria. Bacteria were identified using both conventional and molecular methods. Sanger sequence procedure used for 16S ribosomal RNA and phylogenetic analysis was performed using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-7) software. In this study, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus were reported as 58, 28 and 14.0% respectively. Phylogenetic tree revealed that 99% of sample No. Ai (05) is closely related to E. coli to (NR 114042.1 E. coli strain NBRC 102203). Aii (23) is 99% similar to K. pneumoniae to (NR 117686.1 K. pneumonia strain DSM 30104) and 90% Bi (48) is closely linked to S. aureus to (NR 113956.1 S. aureus strain NBRC 100910). The antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli recorded highest resistance towards ampicillin (90%) and least resistant to ofloxacin (14%). Some of the other antibiotics such amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, cefuroxime and nitrofurantoin resistance were observed 86, 62, 24, 55, 48 and 35% respectively. The cefuroxime showed the highest antibiotic resistance against K. pneumoniae with 85% followed by amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, ceftazidime, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin resulted in 60, 45, 67, 70, 75 and 30% respectively. The resistance of S. aureus against erythromycin, cefuroxime and ampicillin were found with 72%. The resistance against amoxicillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone found 57, 43, 43 and 15% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis shows that sequences are closely related with the reference sequences and E. coli is the dominant bacteria among UTI patients and is resistant to the commercially available antibiotics.",
