  "title": "Increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes among Hong Kong children and adolescents: The Hong Kong Childhood Diabetes Registry 2008 to 2017.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The incidence of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been reported to be rising but there is also evidence that it has been attenuated in recent years. We described the time trends and the incidence of T1D in children in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2017 and compared with the previous local registry in 1997 to 2007. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Hong Kong Childhood Diabetes Registry, which was established in 2016. It consists of a retrospective registry (including all childhood diabetes diagnosed in 2008 to 2015) and a prospective registry (including all T1D children diagnosed from 2016 onwards). All T1D children diagnosed at the age of less than 18 years from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2017 and managed in the public system were included in this study. RESULTS: For the incident years in the 2008 to 2017 period, a total of 498 children with T1D was identified. The crude incidence rate was 4.3 per 100 000 person/year (95% confidence interval 3.96-4.72), which was much higher than the last registry of 2.2 per 100 000 persons/year. Using general linear model, the increment is statistically significant (P = .02). When compared to the last registry, the rate of increment had attenuated, with annual increment in crude incidence in the two periods for T1D <15 years changing from 4.3% to 3.5% (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of T1D children increased significantly in the past two decades in Hong Kong, but the rate of increase had attenuated in recent years.",
