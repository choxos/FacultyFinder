  "title": "GEF-independent Ran activation shifts a fraction of the protein to the cytoplasm and promotes cell proliferation.",
  "abstract": "Ran (Ras-related nuclear protein) plays several important roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitotic spindle formation, nuclear envelope/nuclear pore complex assembly, and other functions in the cytoplasm, as well as in cellular transformation when switched on. Unlike other members of the GTPase superfamily, Ran binds more tightly to GDP than to GTP due to the presence of an auto-inhibitory C-terminal tail. Multiple missense mutations in the C-terminus of Ran occur in cancers, but their biological significance remains unclear. Here, the quantitative GDP/GTP binding preference of four engineered mutations with unstable C-termini was analyzed using a devised mant-GDP dissociation assay. The results showed that the impact of different C-terminal mutations depends on multiple factors. Although these mutants were more GTP-loaded in human cells, they were shown to be more cytoplasmic, and to support nuclear transport with minimally or partially reduced efficiency. Further, several Ran cancer mutants were compromised in autoinhibition, slightly more GTP-bound, more cytoplasmic, and enhanced the proliferation of A549 and HeLa cells in vitro. Thus, our work reveals a new route of Ran activation independent of guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which may account for the hyper-proliferation induced by Ran cancer mutations.",
