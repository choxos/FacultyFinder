  "title": "Rapid start-up of partial nitrification reactor by exogenous AHLs and Vanillin combined with intermittent aeration.",
  "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) and quorum quenching (QQ) are common phenomena in microbial systems and play an important role in the nitrification process. However, rapidly start up partial nitrification regulated by N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs)-mediated QS or QQ has not been reported. Hence, we chose N-butyryl homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) and N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) as the representative AHLs, and Vanillin as the representative quorum sensing inhibitor (QSI) combined intermittent aeration to investigate their effects on the start-up process of partial nitrification. The start-up speed in the group with C4-HSL or C6-HSL addition was 1.42 or 1.26 times faster than that without addition, respectively. Meanwhile, the ammonium removal efficiency with C4-HSL or C6-HSL addition was increased by 13.87 % and 17.30 % than that of the control group, respectively. And, partial nitrification could maintain for a certain period without AHLs further addition. The increase of Nitrosomonas abundance and ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) activity, and the decrease of Nitrobacter abundance and nitrite oxidoreductase (NXR) activity were the reasons for the rapid start-up of partial nitrification in the AHLs groups. Vanillin addition reduced AMO and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) activity, and increased Nitrobacter abundance and NXR activity, thus these were not conducive to achieving partial nitrification. Denitrifying bacteria (Hydrogenophaga, Thauera and Aquimonas) abundance increased in the Vanillin group. QS-related bacteria and gene abundance were elevated in the AHLs group, and reduced in the Vanillin group. Function prediction demonstrated that AHLs promoted the nitrogen cycle while Vanillin enhanced the carbon cycle. This exploration might provide a new technical insight into the rapid start-up of partial nitrification based on QS control.",
