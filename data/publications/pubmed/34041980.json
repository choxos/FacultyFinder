  "title": "Men's Dropout From Mental Health Services: Results From a Survey of Australian Men Across the Life Span.",
  "abstract": "While increasing numbers of Australian men are accessing mental health services, the sustainability of their therapy engagement varies significantly, with many men being lost to follow-up. The current study investigated dropout rates in a large community-based male sample to highlight the reasons for, and potential predictors of, men dropping out of mental health care services. Data were drawn from an online survey of 1907 Australian men (aged 16-85; M = 44.1 years) reflecting on their broad experiences in mental health therapy. Participants responded to bespoke items assessing their past dropout experience and reasons for dropping out, the odds of which were modeled in relation to demographics and predictors (e.g., therapist engagement strategies, alignment to traditional masculinity and pre-therapy feelings of optimism, shame, and emasculation). The overall dropout rate from therapy was 44.8% (n = 855), of which 26.6% (n = 120) accessed therapy once and did not return. The most common reasons for dropout were lack of connection with the therapist (54.9%) and the sense that therapy lacked progress (20.2%). Younger age, unemployment, self-reported identification with traditional masculinity, the presence of specific therapist engagement strategies, and whether therapy made participants feel emasculated all predicted dropout. Current depressive symptoms and suicidality were also higher amongst dropouts. Therapists should aim to have an honest discussion with all clients about the importance of therapy fit, including the real likelihood of dropout, in order to ensure this does not deter future engagement with professional services.",
