  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A sizeable proportion of pathogenic genetic variants identified in young children tested for congenital differences are associated with neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders (NPD). In this growing group, a genetic diagnosis often precedes the emergence of diagnosable developmental concerns. Here, we describe DAGSY (Developmental Assessment of Genetically Susceptible Youth), a novel interdisciplinary 'genetic-diagnosis-first' clinic integrating psychiatric, psychological and genetic expertise, and report our first observations and feedback from families and referring clinicians. METHODS: We retrieved data on referral sources and indications, genetic and NPD diagnoses and recommendations for children seen at DAGSY between 2018 and 2022. Through a survey, we obtained feedback from twenty families and eleven referring clinicians. RESULTS: 159 children (mean age 10.2 years, 57.2% males) completed an interdisciplinary (psychiatry, psychology, genetic counselling) DAGSY assessment during this period. Of these, 69.8% had a pathogenic microdeletion or microduplication, 21.5% a sequence-level variant, 4.4% a chromosomal disorder, and 4.4% a variant of unknown significance with emerging evidence of pathogenicity. One in four children did not have a prior NPD diagnosis, and referral to DAGSY was motivated by their genetic vulnerability alone. Following assessment, 76.7% received at least one new NPD diagnosis, most frequently intellectual disability (24.5%), anxiety (20.7%), autism spectrum (18.9%) and specific learning (16.4%) disorder. Both families and clinicians responding to our survey expressed satisfaction, but also highlighted some areas for potential improvement. CONCLUSIONS: DAGSY addresses an unmet clinical need for children identified with genetic variants that confer increased vulnerability for NPD and provides a crucial platform for research in this area. DAGSY can serve as a model for interdisciplinary clinics integrating child psychiatry, psychology and genetics, addressing both clinical and research needs for this emerging population.",
