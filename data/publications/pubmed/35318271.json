  "title": "DNA repair defects in cancer and therapeutic opportunities.",
  "abstract": "DNA repair and DNA damage signaling pathways are critical for the maintenance of genomic stability. Defects of DNA repair and damage signaling contribute to tumorigenesis, but also render cancer cells vulnerable to DNA damage and reliant on remaining repair and signaling activities. Here, we review the major classes of DNA repair and damage signaling defects in cancer, the genomic instability that they give rise to, and therapeutic strategies to exploit the resulting vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss the impacts of DNA repair defects on both targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and highlight emerging principles for targeting DNA repair defects in cancer therapy.",
