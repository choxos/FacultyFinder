  "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the impact of meal support therapy on the use of nasogastric feeding for adolescent patients hospitalized with Anorexia Nervosa. Charts of 21 adolescents (mean age 15.1 +/- 1.9 years) were reviewed. The incidence of nasogastric feeding was substantially reduced after the implementation of meal support therapy (67% versus 11% [p < .02]). No differences in length of stay, change in weight, or readmission rates were observed. Meal support therapy significantly reduces the use of nasogastric feeding on inpatient units treating children and adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa.",
