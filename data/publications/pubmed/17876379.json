  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Early mortality from off-pump and on-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was assessed and compared with two widely used risk algorithms for CABG: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE). METHOD: From March 12, 2001, to December 31, 2002, 1657 consecutive patients were treated with off-pump CABG and 1693 consecutive patients were treated with on-pump CABG. The predicted risk of mortality scores for the STS and EuroSCORE models were calculated. The predictive accuracy for early mortality was assessed by comparing the observed and expected mortalities for equal-sized quantiles of risk using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. The discriminatory power of the models was evaluated by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: The observed postoperative mortality was 1.8% (95% CI 1.3% to 2.4%) for off-pump CABG and 1.5% (95% CI 1.1% to 2.1%) for on-pump CABG. For both on-pump and off-pump CABG surgery, the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test indicated good accuracy. The area under the ROC curve was 0.81 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.90) for the STS and 0.79 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.88) for EuroSCORE in off-pump CABG (P=0.567). The area under the ROC curve was 0.82 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.91) for STS and 0.81 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.90) for EuroSCORE in on-pump CABG (P=0.616). The STS-predicted risk of stroke, prolonged ventilation and renal failure were similar to the observed data, with relatively good discriminatory powers for both off-pump and on-pump CABG. CONCLUSION: Both the STS and EuroSCORE risk algorithms are good predictors of early mortality from off-pump or on-pump CABG surgery. However, the generalizability of these results in the Canadian context would require a broader sampling of Canadian centres, including ones that provide both on-pump and off-pump CABG.",
