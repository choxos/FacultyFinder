  "title": "Assessing the quality of drug detailing.",
  "abstract": "This study measured the validity of a new instrument, the Assessment Instrument for Drug Detailing (AIDD), used by doctors to score the quality of drug detailing provided by pharmaceutical representatives in their offices. Five pharmaceutical representatives provided \"good, medium, and poor\" details to 135 family doctors in their offices, who were blinded to the quality of the details. A \"reference standard group\" constructed the details and trained the representatives. An \"assessment group\" trained family physicians to use the AIDD to score the details. Physicians discriminated between different quality details in all but one domain, nomenclature (P </=.001). Physicians scored good quality presentations 2.3 points higher than poor quality details, and reported that they learned more from good than poor quality details. Approximately 71% of the variability in physicians' global ratings (R(2) = 0.71) was explained by assigned detail quality, F(2, 118) = 54.64, P <.0001, presentation time, F(2, 118) = 9.98, P <.0001, pharmaceutical representative, F(4, 118) = 9.58, P <.0001, and physician rating the detail, F(109, 118) = 1.94, P <.0001.",
