  "title": "Factors Associated With Early Computed Tomography Imaging in Children Hospitalized With Severe Orbital Infections.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We identified factors associated with computed tomographic (CT) imaging within 24 hours of emergency department (ED) presentation in hospitalized children with severe orbital infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted that included children aged 2 months to 18 years between 2009 and 2018 who were admitted to the hospital with severe orbital infections, including periorbital and orbital cellulitis. Multivariable modified Poisson regression was used to identify possible factors associated with receiving a CT scan within 24 hours of ED presentation. RESULTS: Of 1144 children, 494 (43.2%) received a CT scan within 24 hours of ED presentation. Factors associated with receiving a CT scan within 24 hours included sex (male; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33), hospitalized at a children's hospital (aRR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.32-2.45), consulted by both ophthalmology and otolaryngology (aRR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.35-4.13) or either ophthalmology (aRR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.66-2.90) or otolaryngology (aRR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.84-3.86), and had proptosis (aRR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.24-1.57) or eye swollen shut (aRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.13-1.43) as clinical signs upon ED presentation. Children aged younger than 5 years were less likely to receive early CT imaging (aRR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.53-0.74). There were no associations between time of ED triage, temperature greater than 38 °C, or inflammatory markers with early CT imaging. CONCLUSION: Although several patient and hospital factors associated with early CT imaging decisions in children with severe orbital infections are associated with more severe infections, newly identified risk factors, such as inflammatory markers, were not. These findings will help better the understanding of clinical management and indications for CT imaging.",
