  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Clinical cancer genetics services are expanding globally, but national policy and health care systems influence availability and implementation. Understanding the environmental factors within a country is required to appropriately implement, adapt, and evaluate cancer genetics service delivery models. An environmental scan (ES) is an approach used in business, public health, health care and other sectors to collect information about an environment or system for strategic decision making and program planning. An ES has been previously used to assess cancer genetics clinic-level factors to inform quality improvement efforts in the United States. We assessed the feasibility of using an ES to collect information about factors that may influence cancer genetics service delivery in the outer-most socio-ecological model environmental levels (policy, national agencies, healthcare systems, cultural considerations) in three Latin American countries. METHODS: Oncology and Genetics care team members at three participating sites used publicly available sources and personal experiences to complete a data collection form (DCF) that included questions about subtopics: laws and policies, relevant agencies and regulations, health care systems and insurance, and cultural considerations. Time to complete the DCF and DCF completeness were used to measure ES feasibility. RESULTS: Participating sites completed the DCF in 3 months, and most questions (average, 87.0%) were answered. Questions in the cultural considerations subtopic had the fewest answers (average, 77.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the ES was feasible and identified a lack of published literature related to cultural considerations impacting health care and genetics services uptake in Latin America. Environmental factors impact cancer genetics services, and identification of these factors will facilitate future collaborative research and genetics service delivery dissemination efforts.",
