  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common in patients with heart failure (HF). Real-world data about long-term outcomes and rhythm control interventions use in AF patients with and without HF remain scarce. METHODS: AF patients from two prospective, multicentre studies were classified based on the HF status at baseline into: HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), HF with reduced or mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF/HFmrEF), and no HF. The prespecified primary outcome was risk of HF hospitalisation. Other outcomes of interest included mortality, cardiovascular events, AF progression, and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 1265 patients with AF were analysed (mean age 69.6 years, women 27.4%) with a median follow-up of 5.98 years. Patients with HFpEF (n = 126) had a 2.69-fold and patients with HFrEF/HFmrEF (n = 308) had a 2.12-fold increased risk of HF hospitalisation compared to patients without HF (n = 831, p < 0.001). Similar results applied for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The risk for AF progression was higher for patients with HFpEF and HFrEF/HFmrEF (6.30 and 6.79 per 100 patient-years, respectively) compared to patients without HF (4.20). The use of rhythm control strategies during follow-up was least in the HFpEF population (4.56 per 100 patient-years) compared to 7.74 in HFrEF/HFmrEF and 8.03 in patients with no HF. With regards to quality of life over time, this was worst among HFpEF patients. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of HFpEF among patients with AF carried a high risk of HF hospitalisations and AF progression, and worse quality of life. Rhythm control interventions were rarely offered to HFpEF patients. These results uncover an unmet need for enhanced therapeutic interventions in patients with AF and HFpEF.",
