  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective was to analyse how the pandemic affected primary care access and comprehensiveness in chronic disease management by comparing primary care patterns before and during the early COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: We conducted a quasi-experimental pre-post design cohort study and reported indicators for the 21 months before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. SETTING: We used electronic medical record data from primary care clinics enrolled in the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2021. POPULATION: The study population included patients (n=919 928) aged 18 years or older with at least one primary care contact from 12 March 2018 to 12 March 2020, in Canada. OUTCOME MEASURES: The study indicators included three indicators measuring access to primary care (encounters, blood pressure measurements and lab tests) and three for comprehensiveness (diagnoses, non-COVID-19 vaccines administered and referrals). RESULTS: 67.3% of the cohort was aged ≥40 years, 56.4% were female and 53.5% were from Ontario, Canada. Fewer patients received an encounter during the pandemic (91.5% to 81.5%), while the median (IQR) number of encounters remained the same (5 (2-1)) for those with access. Fewer patients received a blood pressure measurement (47.9% to 31.8%), and patients received fewer measurements during the pandemic (2 (1-4) to 1 (0-2)). CONCLUSIONS: Encounters with primary care remained consistent during the pandemic, but in-person care, such as lab tests and blood pressure measurements, decreased. In-person care indicators followed temporally to national COVID-19 case counts during the pandemic.",
