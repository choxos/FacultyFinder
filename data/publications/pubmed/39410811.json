  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of transoral robotic surgery (TORS) lingual tonsillectomy in the diagnostic algorithm for head and neck carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) has gained recent popularity. The primary aim of our study was to determine the identification rate of primary tumors in our cohort undergoing lingual ± palatine tonsillectomy for the workup of head and neck CUP. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of all patients undergoing diagnostic TORS for head and neck CUP over an eight-year period, across four centers in two countries. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients undergoing TORS to aid diagnosis of a primary site were included. Overall, TORS lingual ± palatine tonsillectomy identified a primary tumor in 41 (73.2%) patients. Over half were T1 tumors, with 25% measuring under 10 mm. Among those with human papilloma virus (HPV)+ nodal disease, the identification rate was 82.6%. CONCLUSIONS: TORS lingual tonsillectomy is an effective addition to the diagnostic workup of CUP, particularly in those with HPV+ nodal disease.",
