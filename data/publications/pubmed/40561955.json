  "title": "Nano-engineered biochar enhances soil microbial interactions and maize transcriptomic pathways for cadmium detoxification.",
  "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination threatens agroecosystems and food security by degrading soil health, inducing plant oxidative stress, and reducing crop yields. Sustainable strategies integrating biochar (BC) with nanoparticles (NPs) for Cd immobilization and soil-plant-microbe restoration remain underexplored. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of BC, nano-silicon (nSi), and nano-iron (nFe) to immobilize Cd, improve soil health and reprogram maize stress responses in Cd-contaminated soil. Soil Cd bioavailability, microbial networks, and maize transcriptomes were analyzed under varying BC-nSi-nFe formulations. Among these formulations, the BC + 25 % nSi + 75 % nFe + Cd (T6) composite reduced bioavailable Cd by 21 %, raised soil pH from 6.21 to 6.98, and enhanced soil enzyme activities (118-139 %). T6 improved maize biomass (115-119 %), reduced shoot Cd accumulation (78 %), and suppressed oxidative stress (67-75 % ROS reduction). This study presents transcriptomic evidence showing that BC-NPs composites mitigate Cd stress and modulate maize antioxidant defense and phytohormone signaling pathways, offering new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying improved plant resilience. Soil microbial networks shifted toward metal-resistant taxa, with enriched glutathione metabolism and nitrogen fixation. BC-NPs composites offer a multidimensional remediation strategy, integrating nanomaterial science, microbial ecology, and plant molecular biology to mitigate Cd toxicity. This approach enhances soil-plant resilience, supporting sustainable agriculture in contaminated ecosystems.",
