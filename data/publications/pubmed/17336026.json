  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A pilot study was conducted to determine the feasibility and potential efficacy of an interactive voice response (IVR) follow-up system for smokers recently hospitalized with coronary heart disease (CHD). METHODS: Ninety-nine smokers hospitalized with CHD completed a baseline questionnaire, were provided with bedside counseling, and offered nicotine replacement therapy. They were randomly assigned to a usual care (UC) or an IVR group. The IVR group received automated telephone follow-up calls 3, 14 and 30 days after discharge inquiring about their smoking status and confidence in remaining smoke-free. When deemed necessary, they were offered additional counseling. Smoking status was determined 52 weeks after hospital discharge. RESULTS: The 52-week point prevalence abstinence rate in the IVR group was 46.0% compared to 34.7% in the UC group (OR=1.60, 95% CI: 0.71-3.60; P=.25). After adjustment for education, age, reason for hospitalization, length of hospitalization, and quit attempts in the past year, the odds of quitting in the IVR group compared to the UC group were 2.34 (95% CI: 0.92-5.92; P=.07). CONCLUSIONS: IVR is a promising technology for following CHD patients attempting to quit smoking following discharge from hospital, however, a larger trial is required to confirm its efficacy. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: IVR may enhance the timely provision of follow-up counseling for smoking cessation in patients with CHD.",
