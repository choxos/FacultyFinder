  "title": "Creation of Architecturally Minimal Transcriptionally Activating Riboswitches Responsive to Theophylline Reveals an Unconventional Design Strategy.",
  "abstract": "Riboswitches are noncoding RNA switches that are largely utilized in bacteria and play a significant role in synthetic biology. Nonetheless, their natural counterparts possess lengthy sequences and intricate structures, posing challenges for their modular integration into complex gene circuits. Consequently, it is imperative to develop simplified synthetic riboswitches that can be effortlessly incorporated into gene circuits. The conventional approach to generate synthetic riboswitches entails tedious library construction and extensive screening, which frequently yields suboptimal performance. To overcome this obstacle, alternative methods are urgently needed. In this study, we created a novel approach to designing a diverse set of transcription-activating riboswitches that exhibit high performance and broad compatibility. The strategy involved starting with a synthetic theophylline RNA aptamer and designing an expression platform that forms a transcriptional terminator in its inactive state but switches to an antiterminator when it is activated. Several sequences were designed, constructed, and subjected to virtual screening, resulting in the identification of two transcription-activating riboswitches. These riboswitches were then engineered to reduce the basal leakage and increase the activation level through extending the hairpin region using a screened random sequence. These architecturally minimal synthetic riboswitches were highly adapted to different constitutive promoters in a modular manner, generating a differentially responsive output to theophylline. As a proof-of-principle, the synthetic riboswitches were applied to rewire a synthetic quorum-sensing circuit (QSC). The reprogrammed QSC successfully modulated the temporal responsive profile against the activation. This strategy is expected to expand the variety of high-performance riboswitches that are responsive to different ligands, thereby further facilitating the design of complex genetic circuits.",
