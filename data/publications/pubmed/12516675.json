  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare the efficacy of interproximal plaque removal beyond the bristles by two electric toothbrushes, the new Sonicare Elite and Braun Oral-B 3D, in an in vitro model replicating the brushing of interproximal plaque as would occur in vivo. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Oral biofilms were grown, in vitro, in a constant-depth film fermenter on a hydroxyapatite (HA) disc substratum. Brushing experiments were conducted in a brushing machine representing the brushing of interproximal plaque between mandibular molars. The HA discs with oral biofilms were located a minimum of 1.6 mm away from the bristles. The efficacy of plaque removal was assessed by enumeration of the percentage of viable bacteria removed from the biofilms by 5 seconds of brushing with the brush motors either activated or inactivated. RESULTS: In the activated state, both brushes removed a significantly higher percentage of plaque bacteria compared to the inactive brushes (Braun, P = 0.002; Sonicare, P = 0.005). The percentage of plaque bacteria removed by the Sonicare Elite (32.23%) beyond the bristles was significantly greater (P = 0.012) than that removed by the Braun Oral-B 3D (9.48%) in this model system.",
