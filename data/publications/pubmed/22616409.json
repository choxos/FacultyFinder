  "title": "Teaching critical management skills to senior nursing students: videotaped or interactive hands-on instruction?",
  "abstract": "This study examined and compared the effectiveness of videotape training versus hands-on instruction in preparing senior nursing students to respond to emergency clinical situations. Fourth year nursing students (n=27) were randomly assigned to one of three groups; one group received videotaped instruction, one group engaged in a hands-on experience, and one group, a control, received no instruction. Students were evaluated using a three-station objective structured clinical examination that involved high-fidelity simulations. Differences between the control and the two instructional groups were significant (p = .007); however, there was no significant difference between the two types of instruction. It was concluded that instruction on crisis management with a high-fidelity simulator, using either video or hands-on instruction, can result in a significant improvement in performance.",
