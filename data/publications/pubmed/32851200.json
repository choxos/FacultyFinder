  "title": "Towards Population Salt Reduction to Control High Blood Pressure in Ghana: A Policy Direction.",
  "abstract": "Although population salt reduction is considered a \"best buy\" in addressing hypertension and cardiovascular disease, Ghana shares a high hypertension burden with a seemingly high salt consumption. This article discusses best practices in reducing population salt intake and provides preliminary data on salt and potassium intake, as well as the process to develop a road map and identification of actions needed to support the development of a strategic national document towards salt reduction in Ghana. In February 2019, a 2-d stakeholder meeting was held with government agencies, researchers, nongovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, and international partners to deliberate on salt reduction strategies and interventions needed in the face of rising hypertension and other noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in Ghana. Recommendations were developed from the stakeholder meeting and are being considered for inclusion in the revision of Ghana's national NCD policy.",
