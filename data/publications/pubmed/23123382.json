  "title": "Effect of umbilical cord milking in term and near term infants: randomized control trial.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of umbilical cord milking as compared with early cord clamping on hematological parameters at 6 weeks of age among term and near term neonates. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized control trial. Eligible neonates (>35 weeks' gestation) were randomized in intervention and control groups (100 each). Neonates of both groups got early cord clamping (within 30 seconds). The cord of the experimental group was milked after cutting and clamping at 25 cm from the umbilicus, whereas in control group cord was clamped near (2-3 cm) the umbilicus and not milked. Both groups got similar routine care. Unpaired Student t and Fisher exact tests were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics were comparable in the 2 groups. Mean hemoglobin (Hgb) (11.9 [1.5] g/dL and mean serum ferritin 355.9 [182.6] μg/L) were significantly higher in the intervention group as compared with the control group (10.8 [0.9] g/dL and 177.5 [135.8] μg/L), respectively, at 6 weeks of age. The mean Hgb and hematocrit at 12 hours and 48 hours was significantly higher in intervention group (P = .0001). The mean blood pressure at 30 minutes, 12 hours, and 48 hours after birth was significantly higher but within normal range. No significant difference was observed in the heart rate, respiratory rate, polycythemia, serum bilirubin, and need of phototherapy in the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Umbilical cord milking is a safe procedure and it improved Hgb and iron status at 6 weeks of life among term and near term neonates.",
