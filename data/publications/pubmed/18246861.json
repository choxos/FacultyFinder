  "title": "Social well-being in pregnant women: intended versus unintended pregnancies.",
  "abstract": "The relationship between pregnancy intention (unintended versus intended pregnancy) and social well-being was examined in a sample of 72 pregnant, mostly low-income women attending Women, Infants, and Children programs and prenatal clinics in a midwestern community. Feelings of happiness about giving birth and the extent to which having a baby would fill a void in one's life were also examined. Pregnancy intention was significantly associated with reduced social support. Feelings of happiness about having the baby positively correlated with all domains of social support and negatively correlated with loneliness and family relationship problems. The belief that having a baby could fill a void in a woman's life was strongly correlated with perceived loneliness. Interventions to increase social support and to address areas of stress for women whose pregnancies are unintended are recommended. Future research in larger random samples is needed to better test these associations and to make recommendations for specific practice interventions to increase social well-being.",
