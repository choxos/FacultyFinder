  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Heterotopic ossification (HO) in hip arthroscopy is a common post-operative complication. This review was undertaken to provide an update (2014 present) on the current literature regarding HO in hip arthroscopy. RECENT FINDINGS: Risk factors for HO post-hip arthroscopy include male gender, mixed impingement, picture, and the size of CAM resection. HO prophylaxis with NSAIDs has been proven to decrease the rate of HO post-hip arthroscopy; however, there is inherent risk to long-standing NSAIDs therapy. HO post-hip arthroscopy is not uncommon as a radiological finding, but symptomatic HO post-hip arthroscopy requiring revision surgery is a rare event, at <â€‰1%. The outcomes for revision surgery for HO excision have fair outcomes. The hip arthroscopist should stratify their patients based on known risk factors, and determine whether NSAIDs prophylaxis is warranted.",
