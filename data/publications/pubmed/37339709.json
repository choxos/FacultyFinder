  "title": "Polymorphs of a 1:1 salt of sulfadiazine and piperazine-relative stability, dissolution studies, pharmacokinetics and anti-meningitis efficiency.",
  "abstract": "Two new salt forms of sulfadiazine (SDZ) and piperazine (PIP) were synthesized and characterized. Out of the two polymorphs (SDZ-PIP Ⅰ and SDZ-PIP II), SDZ-PIP Ⅱ is the more stable form at low temperature, room temperature and high temperature. The solution-mediated phase transformation result shows that SDZ-PIP II can transform into pure SDZ within 15 s in phosphate buffer at 37 °C, which leads to a loss in solubility advantage. The addition of 2 mg/mL PVP K30, a polymeric crystallization inhibitor, maintains the solubility advantage and permits supersaturation for a longer period of time. SDZ-PIP II showed 2.5 times the solubility of SDZ alone. The area under the curve (AUC) of SDZ-PIP II with 2 mg/mL PVP K30 was approximately 165% of that of SDZ alone. Moreover, SDZ-PIP II with PVP K30 was more effective than SDZ alone in treating meningitis. Therefore, the SDZ-PIP II salt improves the solubility, bioavailability, and anti-meningitis activity of SDZ.",
