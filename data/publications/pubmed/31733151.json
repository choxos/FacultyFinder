  "abstract": "AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the association of high-commitment human resource practices (HCHRPs) with nurses' compassionate care behaviour. BACKGROUND: The extant research highlights the key role of compassionate care behaviour in achieving quality health services. However, scant attention has been paid to identifying the factors that augment compassionate care behaviour among health care professionals. METHODS: This study took place from September 2018 to March 2019, collecting data from 340 nurses of either gender aged 24-60 years with at least 1 year experience. The study follows a cross-sectional research design by collecting data through a personally administered survey. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was found between the four dimensions of HCHRPs and organisational commitment. Moreover, organisational commitment positively related to compassionate care behaviour and mediated the relationship between HCHRPs and compassionate care behaviour. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal that four dimensions of HCHRPs positively influence nurses' compassionate care behaviour via the indirect path of organisational commitment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: The study marks the first attempt to delineate the role of HCHRPs in enhancing the compassionate care behaviour. The hospital administration and human resource managers should use HCHRPs as strategic imperative to attract competent employees and enhance compassionate care behaviour.",
