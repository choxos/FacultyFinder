  "title": "Comprehensive endometriosis care: a modern multimodal approach for the treatment of pelvic pain and endometriosis.",
  "abstract": "Endometriosis is a prevalent gynecological disease, leading to chronic pain and inflammation, affecting 1 in 10 individuals presumed female at birth. The diagnostic journey is often arduous, marked by neglect of the right diagnosis and prolonged wait times, significantly compromising the quality of life among those affected. This review provides a nuanced exploration of endometriosis-associated pain management, encompassing medical, surgical, and holistic approaches, all guided by accurate and refined diagnostics. Our paramount goal is to empower physicians as key figures in confronting this intricate challenge with a patient-centric approach, ultimately aiming to improve treatment and quality of life. Acknowledging each patient's unique needs, we emphasize the importance of tailoring a spectrum of options informed by current literature and insights gleaned from our experience in a high-volume tertiary endometriosis center. It is imperative to recognize endometriosis as a complex and chronic disease, often occurring with co-morbid conditions and nuanced complexities, necessitating a long-term personalized multimodal approach for each case. In addition, incorporating principles such as patient autonomy, profound respect for diverse experiences, and practical education on treatment choices is pivotal in enhancing treatment outcomes and overall patient satisfaction.",
