  "abstract": "Celastrol is a triterpenoid compound extracted from the Chinese herb Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F. Previous research has revealed its anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and immunosuppressive properties. Here, we investigated whether celastrol inhibits oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induced oxidative stress in RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, the effect of celastrol on atherosclerosis in vivo was assessed in apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE(-/-)) mouse fed a high-fat/high-cholesterol diet (HFC). We found that celastrol significantly attenuated oxLDL-induced excessive expression of lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1(LOX-1) and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cultured RAW264.7 macrophages. Celastrol also decreased IκB phosphorylation and degradation and reduced production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL-6. Celastrol reduced atherosclerotic plaque size in apoE(-/-) mice. The expression of LOX-1 within the atherosclerotic lesions and generation of superoxide in mouse aorta were also significantly reduced by celastrol while the lipid profile was not improved. In conclusion, our results show that celastrol inhibits atherosclerotic plaque developing in apoE(-/-) mice via inhibiting LOX-1 and oxidative stress.",
