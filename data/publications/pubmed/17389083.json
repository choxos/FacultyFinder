  "title": "Evaluation of ten oral fluid point-of-collection drug-testing devices.",
  "abstract": "Previously, the laboratory evaluations of six point-of-collection oral fluid (POC-OF) drug testing devices were reported. Four additional devices, Oralstat (American Bio Medica); SmartClip (Envitec); Impact (LifePoint); and OraLine IV s.a.t (Sun Biomedical Laboratories), were recently evaluated for their ability to meet the claimed (and proposed) cutoff concentrations set by the manufacturers for the detection of amphetamine(s), cocaine/metabolite, opiates, and cannabinoids (Oralstat also benzodiazepines). With the exception of the Sun Biomedical device, actual false-positive results were not encountered. Most devices performed well for the detection of opiates and amphetamine(s), but approximately half had amphetamine(s) cutoff concentrations greater than that proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Only three devices had cocaine cutoffs less than or equal to 20 ng/mL (SAMHSA), and a number of false-negative results were obtained. The devices still were not capable of detecting Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol at 4 ng/mL (SAMHSA). However, sensitivities improved since the initial studies, and approximately half of the devices met the THC-COOH cutoff proposed by SAMHSA. Results from the current and previous evaluations are presented in the paper and indicate that the sensitivity and performance of commercial OF drug testing devices is improving, but remains problematic for the reliable detection of cannabinoid use.",
