  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the opinion of Brazilian orthopedists surgeons on the diagnosis and treatment of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI). METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to several orthopedic societies around the world, including the Sociedade Brasileira de Ortopedia e Traumatologia (SBOT). This questionnaire was sent electronically and included questions on many topics related to FAI. RESULTS: 253 Brazilian orthopedists responded the questionnaire. Sixty-eight point nine percent worked in private practice and 23.1% in academic institutions. Pain during hip rotation was the most important finding in the clinical history according to 81.8% of the respondents and the anterior impingement sign was the most important finding in the physical examination according to 88.2%. Initial treatment was physiotherapy according to 86.2%. Surgical treatment was hip arthroscopy according to 38.8%, and via surgical hip dislocation for 14.7%. CONCLUSION: Brazilian orthopedists' opinions on FAI are similar to their international colleagues. There is considerable discrepancy in the answers provided, demonstrating a need for future investigation on FAI, in order to institute proper treatment and diagnosis protocols. Level of Evidence V. Expert Opinion.",
