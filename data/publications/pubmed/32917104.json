  "abstract": "Musculoskeletal pain is a prominent complaint in primary care resulting in increased referrals to physical therapy (PT); however, the referral system often results in delays and discontinuation of care. Several models have been developed to improve the referral process including integrating PT into primary care clinics. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Center of Excellence in Primary Care Education (CoEPCE), which educates post-graduate trainees in interprofessional teams, began (in 2015) embedding physical therapists into primary care clinics enabling patients to see a physical therapist during their primary care visit. To evaluate the efficacy of this model we tracked the numbers of PT referrals, the number of completed referrals, and the length of time between referral and completion. PT referral parameters from PT-integrated trainees in the CoEPCE were compared to two traditional primary care training clinics at the same VHA site (Firm A and Firm B). Results indicate that the CoEPCE placed and completed more PT referrals and did so with a shorter turnaround time than was seen in the other two clinics. Further analysis suggests that the decreased turnaround time can be attributed to the integration of PTs into the primary care clinic. The results support extending the use of interprofessional clinics that integrate PT into primary care settings.",
