  "abstract": "The present study deals with isolation and characterization of copper oxide nanoparticles resistant Pseudomonas strains that were isolated from the soil collected from mining and refining sites of Sarcheshmeh copper mine in the Kerman Province of Iran. The three isolates were selected based on high level of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) resistance. The isolates were authentically identified as Pseudomonas fluorescens CuO-1, Pseudomonas fluorescens CuO-2 and Pseudomonas sp. CuO-3 by morphological, biochemical and 16S rDNA gene sequencing analysis. The growth pattern of these isolates with all the studied CuO NPs concentrations was similar to that of control (without CuO NPs) indicating that CuO NPs would not affect the growth of isolated strains. A reduction in the amount of exopolysaccharides was observed after CuO NPs-P. fluorescens CuO-1 culture supernatant interaction. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) peaks for the exopolysaccharides extracted from the bacterial culture supernatant and the interacted CuO NPs were almost similar. The exopolysaccharide capping of the CuO NPs was confirmed by FT-IR and X-ray diffraction analysis. The study of bacterial exopolysaccharides capped CuO NPs with E. coli PTCC 1338 and S. aureus PTCC 1113 showed less toxicity compared to uncoated CuO NPs. Our study suggests that the capping of nanoparticles by bacterially produced exopolysaccharides serve as the probable mechanism of tolerance.",
