  "title": "Targeting HSPA8 inhibits proliferation via downregulating BCR-ABL and enhances chemosensitivity in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia cells.",
  "abstract": "The resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors is currently a major problem for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treatment and HSPA8 is highly expressed and a hallmark of poor prognosis in several human cancers. However, its role in imatinib-resistant CML (IR-CML) cells remains undetermined. Here, we determined HSPA8 was overexpressed in IR-CML cells and associated with imatinib resistance. HSPA8 ablation could downregulate BCR-ABL/STAT5 and BCR-ABL/AKT signaling pathways, dramatically induce proliferation inhibition, autophagy, G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest but not apoptosis in IR-CML cells. Significantly, HSPA8 ablation enhanced the antitumor activity of imatinib via promoting apoptosis in vitro and vivo. These findings unraveled that HSPA8 ablation inhibits proliferation via downregulating BCR-ABL and enhances chemosensitivity of imatinib in IR-CML cells, which investigate the role and molecular mechanism of HSPA8 in IR-CML cells and suggest that HSPA8 may be a potential target for IR-CML treatment.",
