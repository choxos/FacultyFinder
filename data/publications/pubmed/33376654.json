  "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is known to affect different organs in the body. Nervous system involvement is common and can manifest as neurological or neuropsychiatric symptoms. A 23-year-old female with no significant past medical history, presented with nausea and vomiting for two weeks and unusual behavior for three days. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed small vessel ischemic changes and abnormal T2 flair/periventricular signal. Lab workup was positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies. The patient was diagnosed with SLE; positive serology and multisystem involvement including neurologic, serositis, and musculoskeletal system. Acute onset of abnormal behavior and memory problems were attributed to lupus cerebritis. The patient was started on methylprednisolone and had significant improvement in neurologic status within the next two days.",
