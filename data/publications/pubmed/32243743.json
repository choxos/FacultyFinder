  "title": "How to critically appraise a qualitative health research study.",
  "abstract": "Evidence-based nursing is a process that requires nurses to have the knowledge, skills, and confidence to critically reflect on their practice, articulate structured questions, and then reliably search for research evidence to address the questions posed. Many types of research evidence are used to inform decisions in health care and findings from qualita- tive health research studies are useful to provide new insights about individuals' experi- ences, values, beliefs, needs, or perceptions. Before qualitative evidence can be utilized in a decision, it must be critically appraised to determine if the findings are trustworthy and if they have relevance to the identified issue or decision. In this article, we provide practical guidance on how to select a checklist or tool to guide the critical appraisal of qualitative studies and then provide an example demonstrating how to apply the critical appraisal process to a clinical scenario.",
