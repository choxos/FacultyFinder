  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, accounting for 18 % of all cancer deaths. The limitations of conventional therapies, such as chemotherapy, are exacerbated by multidrug resistance (MDR) and systemic toxicity, underscoring the urgent need for innovative treatment strategies. Nanotechnology, particularly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), shows potential in overcoming MDR by modulating key transporters and associated pathways, providing a promising approach for site-specific drug delivery with reduced adverse effects. AgNPs exhibit significant cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in lung cancer cell lines through mechanisms involving gene regulation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial depolarization. Biosynthesized AgNPs, particularly those derived from plant extracts, demonstrate enhanced biocompatibility and reduced toxicity. Their anticancer potential has been validated in both in vitro and in vivo models, showing dose-dependent reductions in cell viability, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction. Furthermore, AgNPs can modulate the tumor microenvironment and inhibit angiogenesis, paving the way for targeted lung cancer therapies. Advances such as functionalized AgNPs and their integration into photodynamic therapy further enhance their therapeutic potential. However, challenges related to off-target toxicity and clinical translation remain. Continued research is essential to fully harness AgNPs' potential, bridging the gap between treatment efficacy and safety in lung cancer therapy.",
