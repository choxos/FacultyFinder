  "title": "The learning needs of nurses experiencing job change.",
  "abstract": "This study explored the perceived knowledge needs of nurses who experienced job change because of health care restructuring and whether different types of job change influenced learning needs. A questionnaire was distributed to nurses in two teaching hospitals. Results indicated that nurses perceived they needed new knowledge and upgraded clinical skills when experiencing job change. Their learning needs, however, differed with the type of job change experienced. Additionally, nurses felt their orientation only moderately prepared them for their new jobs. The findings suggest orientation programs need to be tailored to address the learning needs of nurses experiencing job change.",
