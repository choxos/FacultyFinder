  "title": "Mechanical characterisation of porcine non-intestinal colorectal tissues for innovation in surgical instrument design.",
  "abstract": "This article presents an investigation into the mechanical properties of porcine mesocolon, small intestinal mesentery, fascia, and peritoneum tissues to generate a preliminary database of the mechanical characteristics of these tissues as surrogates for human tissue. No study has mechanically characterised porcine tissue correlates of the mesentery and associated structures. The samples were tested to determine the strength, stretch at failure, and stiffness of each tissue. The results indicated that porcine mesenteric and associated tissues visually resembled corresponding human tissues and had similar tactile characteristics, according to an expert colorectal surgeon. Stiffness values ranged from 0.088 MPa to 6.858 MPa across all tissues, with fascia being the weakest, and mesentery and peritoneum being the strongest. Failure stress values ranged from 0.336 MPa to 6.517 MPa, and failure stretch values ranged from 1.766 to 3.176, across all tissues. These mechanical data can serve as reference baseline data upon which future work can expand.",
