  "title": "[Association between genetic polymorphisms of interleukin 6 (IL6), IL6R and IL18 with metabolic syndrome in obese Chilean children].",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is highly prevalent among obese children and adolescents and is considered a predictor for the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Obesity is associated with an increase in circulating levels of interleukins 6 (IL6) and 18 (IL18), which in turn would depend on polymorphisms of IL6, IL6R and IL18 genes. AIM: To evaluate the association between genetic polymorphisms of IL6 (rs1800795, rs1800796 and rs1800797), IL6R (rs2228145) and IL18 (rs360719, rs187238 and rs204355) and MS and/or its components in a sample of Chilean obese children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: These polymorphisms were genotyped in 259 obese children aged 10 ± 2 years with a body mass index of 26.1 ± 4.1 kg/m². Sixty eight had metabolic syndrome (26.3%). The association of their alleles, genotypes and haplotypes with the MS and its components was assessed. RESULTS: IL6, IL6R and IL18 variants showed no association with SM nor with any of the phenotypes that compose it. However, IL18 haplotypes (rs360719-rs187238-rs204355) TCT and CGT were associated with triglycerides ≤ 110 mg/dL and HDL < 40 mg/dL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: IL6 and IL6R variants are not associated with MS or with any of its phenotypes. Although an association between IL18 haplotypes and certain MS component has been detected herein, it is necessary to replicate our findings in independent studies due to the low frequency of these allele combinations detected in our sample.",
