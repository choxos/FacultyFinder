  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on the real-world risk of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) among patients with psoriasis exposed to interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) is limited. OBJECTIVE: To compare IBD risk in patients with psoriasis with and without IL-17i exposure. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of patients with psoriasis with and without IL-17i exposure identified by using electronic health records data. Primary outcomes were 6-month and 1-year IBD incidence. RESULTS: Crude 6-month IBD incidence was 0.16% (3/1821) among patients with psoriasis exposed to any IL-17i, 0.24% (3/1246) among those exposed to secukinumab alone, and 0.11% (239/213,060) among those unexposed. Crude 1-year IBD incidence was 0.27% (5/1821) among IL-17i-exposed patients with psoriasis, 0.32% (4/1246) among those exposed to secukinumab alone, and 0.19% (412/213,060) among those unexposed. In adjusted analysis, there was no significant difference in odds of developing IBD at 6 months (odds ratio, 1.42; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-4.43) and 1 year (odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-3.33) between exposed and unexposed patients with psoriasis. Similarly, there was no significant difference in odds of developing IBD at 6 months and 1 year between secukinumab-exposed and -unexposed patients with psoriasis. LIMITATIONS: Analysis may have been limited by the low number of outcome events. CONCLUSION: The incidence of IBD among patients with psoriasis exposed to IL-17i is low, and the risk appears similar to that for unexposed patients with psoriasis.",
