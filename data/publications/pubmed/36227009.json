  "title": "Baseline Patient-reported Symptoms Less Predictive Than MM-SES-CD for Endoscopic Remission in Crohn's Disease.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This analysis evaluates the association between baseline patient-reported symptom (PRS) severity in Crohn's disease (CD), including abdominal pain, stool frequency, general well-being, and achievement of clinical and endoscopic outcomes. We compared baseline PRS to baseline endoscopic scores for the prediction of endoscopic remission (ER). METHODS: This post hoc analysis of 2 clinical trials of infliximab in CD included 601 patients and evaluated baseline PRS variables (abdominal pain, stool frequency, and general well-being) as measured by the Crohn's disease activity index and their association with 6-month clinical remission (CR) (Crohn's Disease Activity Index<150), corticosteroid-free CR, and week 26/54 ER (absence of mucosal ulceration). Logistic regression models assessed the relationships between PRS and outcomes of interest. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses compared the sensitivity and specificity of the different baseline PRS compared with baseline endoscopic scores for achievement of ER at weeks 26 and 54. RESULTS: No difference was found comparing patients with higher baseline PRS to those with lower PRS in achieving 6-month CR, 6-month corticosteroid-free CR, or week 26/54 ER. Modified multiplier of the SES-CD (MM-SES-CD) at baseline demonstrated a significant ability to predict week 54 ER (area under the curve, 0.71; 95% CI 0.65-0.78; P =0.017). CONCLUSIONS: Baseline PRS in CD is not prognostic of clinical or endoscopic response. In contrast, active endoscopic disease as measured by the MM-SES-CD, more accurately predicts endoscopic outcomes. Endoscopic scores such as the MM-SES-CD may be considered for selection criteria and as a primary outcome of interest in CD trials, with PRS as a co-primary or secondary endpoint.",
