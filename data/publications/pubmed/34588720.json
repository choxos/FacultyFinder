  "title": "THE ROLE OF ULTRASOUND ELASTOGRAPHY IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF PATHOLOGIC CONDITIONS OF TESTICLES AND SCROTUM.",
  "abstract": "Several years ago, elastography emerged as a potentially very useful ultrasound technique that is currently used in diagnostic workup of the breast, liver and some other organ systems, whereas for other ones it is still mainly in the phase of research. The aim of the study was to compare elasticity index (EI) of testicles using strain elastography in healthy subjects and those with pathologic changes of testicles/scrotum. A total of 117 patients were included in the study. Measurements were performed on a Logiq E9 ultrasound system using strain elastography. In healthy subjects, the mean EI value was 1.34±0.35 for right testis and 1.49±0.47 for left testis. Increased mean EI values were found in the following six conditions: patients with varicocele, infertile patients, solitary testis after orchidectomy of the other testicle because of tumor, patients with testicular tumors, patients after orchidopexy of undescended testicle, and patients with congenitally smaller testicle. There is a paucity of literature data on the use of elastography in testes, as well as on normal elastography values in testicular tissue. Strain elastography was demonstrated to be a valuable method to acquire additional information in patients with pathologic changes in testicles/scrotum. These data provide reference values for further research in a larger sample of subjects.",
