  "title": "Photo-assisted synthesis of protonated oxides for fuel cells.",
  "abstract": "The absence of intrinsic protons in proton-conducting oxides (PCO) is a significant challenge that limits the proton conductivity of proton-conducting perovskites, such as Y-doped BaMO3 (M = Zr, Ce), in proton ceramic fuel cells exhibit low conductivity (10[-3] to 10[-2] S cm[-1] at 600 °C). Herein, we introduce a photo-assisted synthesis method for incorporating protons into Al-doped ceria (AlxCe1-xO2-δ, x = 0.2; M-ACO), leveraging the open cubic fluorite structure and photo-activated radical reactions. Specifically, photon-generated hydroxyl reactive OH ∙ and superoxide (O 2 ∙ -) Radicals are generated and interact with the ACO crystal lattice, facilitating proton incorporation and resulting in the synthesis of native-proton-type PCO. This process results in a protonated (H-ACO) with a high proton conductivity of 0.14 S cm[-1] and exceptional power density of 922 mW cm[-2] at 500 °C. This versatile synthesis methodology offers broader development of advanced PCO for energy-related applications.",
