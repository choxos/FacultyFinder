  "abstract": "T-box2 (TBX2) expression has been reported to be related to aggressive tumor features. However, the role of TBX2 in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumorigenesis has never been elucidated. So we aimed at investigating the potential role of TBX2 in NSCLC. TBX2 expression was evaluated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in 50 paired fresh lung cancer tissues as well as immunohistochemistry on 212 paraffin-embedded sections. We showed that the expression level of TBX2 was significantly increased in NSCLC as compared with the adjacent noncancerous tissue. Positive expression level of TBX2 was associated with histological type, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that positive expression level of TBX2 was associated with poor overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival of NSCLC patients. Results showed that TBX2 positivity was an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.004-3.153, p = 0.012). On the basis of these results, we suggested that TBX2 protein expression may be an unfavorable independent prognostic parameter for NSCLC.",
