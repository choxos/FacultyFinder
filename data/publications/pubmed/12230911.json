  "title": "Teaching evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine: 3. Asking the questions and identifying the information.",
  "abstract": "Practicing evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine (EBCAM) requires skills in accessing current valid literature on clinical queries. This requires searching a variety of sources within a broad scope of scientific disciplines. This daunting task requires effective skills for accessing information from both print and electronic sources. This paper identifies the progression from question formulation through to searching and acquiring the valid information. In the evolving information age, complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) practitioners require informational databases and knowledge of search terminology. This paper suggests practical strategies for successful database searches in support of EBCAM.",
