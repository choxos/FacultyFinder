  "title": "Combination of amlodipine plus angiotensin receptor blocker or diuretics in high-risk hypertensive patients: a 96-week efficacy and safety study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antihypertensive therapy is effective in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. However, blood pressure (BP) control rate remains poor and the optimal combination therapy against hypertension is not established in China. The objective of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of two antihypertensive regimens, amlodipine plus telmisartan and amlodipine plus amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide, in patients with essential hypertension and at least one cardiovascular risk factor. METHODS: In a multicenter open-label clinical trial, eligible patients were randomized to receive treatment with amlodipine 2.5-5 mg plus amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide 1.25-2.5 mg/12.5-25 mg (Group A) or amlodipine 2.5-5 mg plus telmisartan 40-80 mg (Group T). If a target BP was not reached, other antihypertensive agents would be added. The target BP was <130/80 mmHg for patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease and <140/90 mmHg for others. Efficacy variables were changes from baseline in systolic BP and diastolic BP at the endpoint of 96 weeks. Safety evaluations included monitoring of any adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Of 13,542 patients randomized, 13,080 (96.6%) completed the study: 6529 in Group A and 6551 in Group T. At endpoint, the BP levels were reduced by 27.4/14.3 mmHg in Group A and 27.1/14.5 mmHg in Group T. The BP control rates were similar for the two therapeutic regimens (87.5% vs 86.1%). Less than 4% of patients in each group discontinued their drugs during follow-up. Peripheral edema was one of the most common AEs, and occurred in only 24 patients in Group A and 19 in Group T. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term combination therapy with amlodipine plus telmisartan or amlodipine plus amiloride/hydrochlorothiazide was not only well tolerated but also efficacious in reducing BP levels with acceptable control rates in the majority of hypertensive patients.
