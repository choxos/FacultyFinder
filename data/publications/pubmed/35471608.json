  "abstract": "Aminoglycoside antibiotics are lifesaving medicines, crucial for the treatment of chronic or drug resistant infections. However, aminoglycosides are toxic to the sensory hair cells in the inner ear. As a result, aminoglycoside-treated individuals can develop permanent hearing loss and vestibular impairment. There is considerable evidence that reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (P38) drives apoptosis in aminoglycoside-treated hair cells. However, treatment strategies that directly inhibit ROS, JNK, or P38 are limited by the importance of these molecules for normal cellular function. Alternatively, the upstream regulator apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1/MAP3K5) is a key mediator of ROS-induced JNK and P38 activation under pathologic but not homeostatic conditions. We investigated ASK1 as a mediator of drug-induced hair cell death using cochlear explants from Ask1 knockout mice, demonstrating that Ask1 deficiency attenuates neomycin-induced hair cell death. We then evaluated pharmacological inhibition of ASK1 with GS-444217 as a potential otoprotective therapy. GS-444217 significantly attenuated hair cell death in neomycin-treated explants but did not impact aminoglycoside efficacy against P. aeruginosa in the broth dilution test. Overall, we provide significant pre-clinical evidence that ASK1 inhibition represents a novel strategy for preventing aminoglycoside ototoxicity. KEY MESSAGES: ASK1 is an upstream, redox-sensitive regulator of P38 and JNK, which are known mediators of hair cell death. Ask1 knockout does not affect hair cell development in vivo, but significantly reduces aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death in vitro. A small-molecule inhibitor of ASK1 attenuates neomycin-induced hair cell death, and does not impact antibiotic efficacy in vitro. ASK1 may be a novel molecular target for preventing aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss.",
