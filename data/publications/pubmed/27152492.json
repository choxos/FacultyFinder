  "abstract": "QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY: The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing worldwide, corresponding to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. The latest study on prevalence of CKD involving the three linguistic regions of Switzerland dates back to 2002-2003 and definitions have changed since then. We aimed to assess the current prevalence and determinants of CKD in the Swiss general population. METHODS: We analysed the data of 1353 participants from a cross-sectional population-based survey performed in 2010-2012 in the three linguistic regions of Switzerland. The prevalence of CKD and the derived cardiovascular risk categories were assessed according to the Kidney Disease - Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2012 classification, using estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR; CKD-Epidemiological Collaboration equation) and albuminuria level. Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyse factors associated with CKD. RESULTS: We included 660 men and 693 women, equally distributed in four age categories (15-29, 30-44, 45-59 and over 60 years). The overall prevalence of CKD was 10.4%. The prevalence in the low, moderate, high and very high risk KDIGO categories were 89.6%, 8.4%, 1.6% and 0.5%, respectively. The prevalence of CKD was similar in all linguistic regions. In multivariate analysis, female gender, older age, diabetes and uric acid were independently associated with CKD in persons ≥45 y. In younger participants, diabetes and lower educational level were associated with CKD. CONCLUSIONS: In the general Swiss population, CKD affects one in ten adults. Subjects older than 60 years, as well as patients with diabetes and hypertension, show a high prevalence of CKD. Systematic screening may be recommended in this population.",
