  "abstract": "Hepatitis-associated aplastic anaemia (HAAA) is an uncommon variant of aplastic anaemia which may present as acute or chronic, mild and transient or fulminant disease. The development of aplastic anaemia is usually fatal if not treated in time, with mortality rate being as high as 85%. A high index of clinical suspicion is required for the diagnosis and exclusion of acquired forms of aplastic anaemia. Here we present a case of a 28-year-old male who presented with sero-negative hepatitis and rapidly progressive bone marrow failure who was given a trial of Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor followed by a successful allogenic bone marrow transplant.",
