  "title": "Reporting quality of economic evaluations of the negotiated Traditional Chinese Medicines in national reimbursement drug list of China: A systematic review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Traditional Medicine (TM) has a wide uptake in most countries. In China, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a common kind of primary health because of its beneficial effects. This review aimed to appraise the publication reporting quality of economic evaluations for selective TCM in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL), Version 2020, based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for economic evaluation that supported the TCM negotiations in NRDL (2020 version) published from 2001 to 2021, including PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, CNKI, WanFang, and SinoMed. The CHEERS statement was used to appraise the reporting quality of included TCM economic evaluations. RESULTS: A total of 360 articles were retrieved, but only 38 economic evaluations met the inclusion criteria. None of the articles reported all items in the CHEERS checklist. The mean score of included articles is low at 10.93±2.62, with an average scoring rate of 51.31±10.53%. The least reported items included: \"Characterizing heterogeneity,\" \"Conflicts of interest\", \"Discount rate,\" and \"Study perspective,\" with a reporting rate of 0.00%, 5.26%, 7.89%, and 15.79%, respectively. CONCLUSION: An upward trend occurred in the quantity and quality of the economic evaluation publications of TCM in China. TCM economic evaluations are still at an early stage, with an urgent need for improving reporting quality. It may result from research experiences or different ideas between TCM and Western Medicine. Adhering to reporting guidelines like CHEERS and educating economic evaluation investigators can improve TCM economic evaluations' reporting quality.",
