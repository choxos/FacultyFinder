  "title": "Production of domoic acid from large-scale cultures of Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries: A feasibility study.",
  "abstract": "The commercial demand for domoic acid (DA), the phycotoxin responsible for Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning, is currently met by extraction from a diminishing supply of stockpiled contaminated mussels (Mytilus edulis). As this supply becomes scarce, a more reliable source is needed. Purification of the toxin from an algal source would be easier and more economical than from shellfish tissue if algal growth and yield of toxin were maximized. This project was initiated to determine if DA could be produced using large-scale semi-continuous algal cultures, which should reduce labour and shorten the time required for biomass production. Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries was grown in 300-L fibreglass photobioreactors called a Brite-Box™. The effect of temperature and nutrient depletion on the yield of DA by P. multiseries was examined. A decline in maximum cell number without a substantial increase in cellular DA was associated with increased temperature. Maximum total cellular DA (8.8 pg cell[-1]) was achieved at 20 °C. Semi-continuous culture of P. multiseries is accompanied by increasing amounts of DA lost to the medium. The process was deemed to be feasible for growing P. multiseries but methods to recover this extracellular DA are necessary for this process to be economical.",
