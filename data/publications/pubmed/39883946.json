  "title": "Impact of vein-to-vein time in patients with R/R LBCL treated with axicabtagene ciloleucel.",
  "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell products axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel), and lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) are approved for relapsed/refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). Emerging evidence indicates that delayed CAR T-cell infusion, including prolonged time from leukapheresis to infusion, known as vein-to-vein time (V2Vt), may adversely impact clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) and meta-analysis to identify differences in V2Vt in patients with R/R LBCL treated with axi-cel, tisa-cel, or liso-cel. The impact of V2Vt (<28 days vs ≥28 to <40 days vs ≥40 days) on effectiveness and safety outcomes was evaluated in patients treated with axi-cel enrolled in a post-authorization safety study using the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research data. SLR and meta-analysis showed that patients treated with axi-cel had the shortest median V2Vt (30.6 days) compared with tisa-cel (48.4 days) or liso-cel (35.9 days). Real-world analysis of patients treated with axi-cel demonstrated that V2Vt ≥40 days was associated with significantly lower complete response rate than V2Vt <28 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.61) or ≥28 to <40 days (OR, 0.66) and significantly worse overall survival than V2Vt <28 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.33) or ≥28 to <40 days (HR, 1.36). Higher prolonged thrombocytopenia rates were observed in patients with axi-cel V2Vt ≥28 to <40 days or ≥40 days compared with <28 days (OR, 1.44 or 1.95, respectively). Together, these results show the impact of V2Vt on patient outcomes with axi-cel therapy and that earlier infusion with CD19-CAR therapies may be beneficial.",
