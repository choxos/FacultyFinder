  "title": "Case report: Kidney transplantation using a pediatric en bloc graft after normothermic regional perfusion and donation after circulatory death procurement.",
  "abstract": "Kidney transplantation is the ultimate treatment for patients with end stage renal disease. However, with the expanding gap between organ supply and demand, utilization of organs from extended-criteria donors is an important strategy to address this problem. The adoption of normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) after donation after circulatory death has been shown to increase organ utilization and posttransplant outcomes. In this case report, we present the first reported case of a successful kidney transplantation and 1-year follow-up using an en bloc graft from a 2-month-old infant who underwent NRP-donation after circulatory death procurement. This case demonstrates that utilization of NRP in pediatric donors can help expand organ utilization.",
