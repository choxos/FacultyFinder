  "abstract": "Limb malformations are one of the most common types of human congenital malformations. Mutations in the ZRS enhancer of Sonic Hedgehog are thought to be responsible for pre-axial polydactyly in multiple independent families. Here, we describe a large Balochi tribal family from Southern Punjab, Pakistan, with a variable set of limb malformations and a novel ZRS mutation. The family has a limb phenotype characterized by triphalangeal thumb, pre-axial polydactyly, and post-axial polydactyly. There is also a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity with less common clinical findings in the affected family members that include osseous syndactyly of forth-fifth fingers, clinodactyly, hypoplasia of mesoaxial fingers, and bifid halluces. The presentation in most of the affected patients was bilateral and symmetrical. A heterozygous C>A mutation at position 287 of the ZRS enhancer (chr7:156,584,283; hg19) was detected in all affected subjects and is absent from four unaffected family members, 42 unrelated samples, and multiple databases of human variation. Combined, these results identify a novel ZRS287 C>A mutation which leads to a variable spectrum of limb phenotypes.",
