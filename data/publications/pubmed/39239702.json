  "title": "Evaluating remission of type 2 diabetes using a metabolic intervention including fixed-ratio insulin degludec and liraglutide: A randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "AIM: To evaluate the effect on type 2 diabetes remission of short-term intensive metabolic intervention consisting of frequent dietary, exercise and diabetes management coaching, metformin and fixed-ratio insulin degludec/liraglutide. METHODS: In a multicentre open-label randomized controlled trial, insulin-naïve participants within 5 years of diabetes diagnosis were assigned to a 16-week remission intervention regimen or standard care, and followed for relapse of diabetes and sustained remission for an additional year after stopping glucose-lowering drugs. RESULTS: A total of 159 participants aged 57 ± 10 years, with diabetes duration 2.6 ± 1.5 years, body mass index 33.5 ± 6.5 kg/m[2], and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level 53 ± 7 mmol/mol were randomized and analysed (79 intervention, 80 control). At the end of the 16-week intervention period, compared to controls, intervention participants achieved lower HbA1c levels (40 ± 4 vs. 51 ± 7 mmol/mol; p < 0.0001), and lost more weight (3.3 ± 4.4% vs. 1.9 ± 3.0%; p = 0.02). There was a lower hazard of diabetes relapse overall in the intervention group compared to controls (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.45, 0.88; p = 0.007), although this was not sustained over time. Remission rates in the intervention group were not significantly higher than in the control group at 12 weeks (17.7% vs. 12.5%, relative risk [RR] 1.42, 95% CI 0.67, 3.00; p = 0.36) or at 52 weeks (6.3% vs. 3.8%, RR 1.69, 95% CI 0.42, 6.82) following the intervention period. CONCLUSIONS: An intensive remission-induction intervention including fixed-ratio insulin degludec/liraglutide reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes relapse within 1 year without sustained remission.",
