  "title": "Association Between Sociodemographic Disparities and Door to Computerized Tomography Time in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke Across COVID-19 Periods in the Emergency Department: A Multi-Center Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death and long-term disability in the United States. The current guideline for stroke management includes a 25 min timeframe from door-to-computed tomography time (DTCT). However, sociodemographic backgrounds may impact the DTCT in acute stroke patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective, multicenter, cohort study between January 2018 and August 2022 throughout North Texas. The primary endpoint was DTCT â‰¤ 25 min upon arrival to hospital for all patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 23,364 patients were included. Only 4468 patients (19.1%) had DTCT times less than or equal to 25 min, and 16,464 patients (70.5%) had DTCT times more than 25 min. In our cohort, Black (OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.23-1.49) and Asian patients (OR 1.33; 95% CI 1.01-1.74) were more likely to have DTCT > 25 min compared to White patients. Hispanic patients (OR 1.20; 95% CI 1.07-1.34) were more likely to have DTCT > 25 min compared to non-Hispanics. Patients presenting during the COVID (OR 1.45; 95% CI 1.34-1.57) and post-COVID period (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.30-1.65) were more likely to have DTCT > 25 min compared to the pre-COVID period. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated a discrepancy in DTCT time for acute ischemic stroke patients based on their race and ethnic population and an increase in DTCT time after the start of COVID-19, which has persisted after the pandemic. These diverse factors highlight the complex interplay of logistical, organizational, and healthcare challenges that have influenced DTCT time.",
