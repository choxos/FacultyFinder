  "title": "Malaria artemisinin resistance: an extracellular vesicles export hypothesis.",
  "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum causes malaria, and its resistance to artemisinin (ART) - a drug used for managing malaria - threatens to interfere with the effective control of malaria. ART resistance (ARTr) is driven by increased tolerance to oxidative stress and reduced haemoglobin trafficking to the food vacuole. We discuss how extracellular vesicles (EVs) may play a role in developing ARTr.",
