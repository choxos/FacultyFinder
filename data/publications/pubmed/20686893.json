  "title": "Optimal bearing surfaces for total hip replacement in the young patient: a meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Although there is general consensus about the efficacy of total hip replacement (THR) in young patients, the most appropriate bearings in young patients remain highly debated. The three most popular bearings in use include metal-on-polyethylene (MOP), metal-on-metal (MOM) and ceramic-on-ceramic (COC). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of literature to summarise the best available evidence on relative success of the three most popular bearings used in THR in young active patients. Our findings support the use of MOM bearings in the management of the young arthritic hip. These findings, largely based upon observational studies, should be taken in the context of the limitations of such non-randomised study designs.",
