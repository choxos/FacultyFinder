  "title": "If You Build It, Who Will Come? A Description of User Characteristics and Experiences With the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal.",
  "abstract": "Objectives: The McMaster Optimal Aging Portal (the Portal) aims to increase access to evidence-based health information. We would now like to understand who uses the Portal, why, and for what, and elicit feedback and suggestions for future initiatives. Methods: An online survey of users collected data on demographics, eHealth literacy, Internet use, information-seeking behavior, site acceptability and perceived impact on health behaviors, participant satisfaction, and suggestions for improvements using mixed methods. Results: Participants (n = 163, age 69.8 Â± 8.6 years) were predominantly female (76%), married (67%), retired (80%), and well-educated with very good/excellent health (55%). The Portal was easy to use (83%) and relevant (80%), with 68% intending to, and 48% having changed behavior after using the Portal. A number of suggestions for improvement were obtained. Discussion: A better understanding of users' characteristics, needs, and preferences will allow us to improve content, target groups who are not engaging with the Portal, and plan future directions.",
