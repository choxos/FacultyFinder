  "title": "Association Between Hyperuricemia and Ultrasound-Detected Hand Synovitis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although hand synovitis is prevalent in the older population, the etiology remains unclear. Hyperuricemia, a modifiable metabolic disorder, may serve as an underlying mechanism of hand synovitis, but little is known about their relationship. We assessed the association between hyperuricemia and hand synovitis in a large population-based sample. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in Longshan County, Hunan Province, China. Hyperuricemia was defined as a serum urate level >420 μmol/L in men and >360 μmol/L in women. Ultrasound examinations were performed on both hands of 4,080 participants, and both gray-scale synovitis and the Power Doppler signal (PDS) were assessed using semiquantitative scores (grades 0-3). We evaluated the association of hyperuricemia with hand gray-scale synovitis (grade ≥2) and PDS (grade ≥1), respectively, adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index. RESULTS: All required assessments for analysis were available for 3,286 participants. The prevalence of hand gray-scale synovitis was higher among participants with hyperuricemia (30.0%) than those with normouricemia (23.3%), with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-1.62). Participants with hyperuricemia also had a higher prevalence of PDS (aOR 2.36; 95% CI 1.15-4.81). Furthermore, hyperuricemia positively associated, both at the hand and joint levels, with the presence of gray-scale synovitis (aOR 1.27; 95% CI 1.00-1.60 and adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 1.26; 95% CI 1.10-1.44, respectively) and PDS (aOR 2.35; 95% CI 1.15-4.79 and aPR 2.34; 95% CI 1.28-4.30, respectively). CONCLUSION: This population-based study provides more evidence for a positive association between hyperuricemia and prevalent hand synovitis.",
