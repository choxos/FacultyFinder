  "title": "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Cardiovascular Disease: An Evidence Map of the Psychometric Properties of Health Status Instruments.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are important measures of treatment effect and can be used to inform the approval of cardiovascular drugs and devices by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). PURPOSE: To catalogue the health status patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) validated in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), describe their psychometric properties, and assess adherence with both FDA recommendations and the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) framework. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Allied and Complementary Medicine Database from inception to August 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Studies that developed and/or validated health status PROMs in CVD populations. DATA EXTRACTION: Two study authors extracted data on CVD type, PROM psychometric properties, and adherence to FDA recommendations. The risk of bias informing the development or validation of PROMs was assessed using the COSMIN framework. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifty health status PROMs (described in 83 studies) were identified, of which 45 were disease specific and 5 were generic. Eleven (22%) of the 50 PROMs validated in CVDs had minimally important differences (MIDs) established, and 8 (16%) reported on the validation of all psychometric properties recommended by the FDA. By COSMIN standards, only 2 PROMs (4%) had all of their psychometric properties rated as sufficient in quality, and 32 PROMs (64%) had less than 50% of psychometric properties rated as sufficient. LIMITATION: The quality of reporting varied across included studies. CONCLUSION: Of 50 PROMs validated in CVDs, only a small minority reported on the validation of all FDA-recommended psychometric properties, had psychometric properties rated as sufficient by COSMIN, or had MIDs established. Given the use of PROMs to guide FDA approvals of drugs and devices in CVDs, there is a need for better adherence to quality standards in PROM validation. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: None.",
