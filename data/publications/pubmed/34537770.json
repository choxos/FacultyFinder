  "title": "International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM): Report from the 2020 Annual Meeting.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The International Dermatology Outcome Measures (IDEOM) initiative is a non-profit organization that aims to develop evidence-based outcome measurements to evaluate the impact of treatments for patients with dermatological disease. IDEOM includes all key stakeholders in dermatology (patient, physician, industry, insurer, and government) during the process of developing such outcome measurements. SUMMARY: Here, we provide an update of IDEOM activities that were presented at the 2020 IDEOM Virtual Annual Meeting (October 23-24, 2020). During the meeting, multiple IDEOM workgroups (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, pyoderma gangrenosum, and actinic keratosis) shared their progress to date, as well as future directions in developing and validating Patient-Reported Outcome Measures. Updates on demonstrating efficacy in clinicals trials by the US Food and Drug Administration are also summarized. KEY MESSAGES: In this report, we summarize the work presented by each IDEOM workgroup (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, pyoderma gangrenosum, and actinic keratosis) at the 2020 IDEOM Virtual Annual Meeting.",
