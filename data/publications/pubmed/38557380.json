  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To investigate the nutritional status of children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and understand the correlation between malnutrition and clinical characteristics as well as lung function. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on clinical data of CF children admitted from January 2016 to June 2023. Clinical characteristics of CF children with different nutritional statuses were compared, and the correlation between malnutrition and lung function was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 52 CF children were included, comprising 25 boys (48%) and 27 girls (52%), aged between 7 months and 17 years. Respiratory symptoms were the predominant clinical manifestations (96%, 50/52). The prevalence of malnutrition was 65% (34/52), with moderate/severe malnutrition being the most common (65%, 22/34). The malnutrition group had a longer duration of illness, higher proportion of digestive system symptoms, and lower levels of serum albumin (P<0.05). Pulmonary function parameters, including forced expiratory volume in one second as a percentage of the predicted value, ratio of forced expiratory volume in one second to forced vital capacity, forced expiratory flow at 25% of forced vital capacity exhaled, forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity exhaled, forced expiratory flow at 75% of forced vital capacity exhaled, and maximum mid-expiratory flow as a percentage of the predicted value, were lower in the malnutrition group compared to the normal nutrition group (P<0.05). Correlation analysis showed body mass index Z-score was positively correlated with the above six pulmonary function parameters (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of malnutrition is high in CF children and is associated with decreased lung function. CF children with higher body mass index have better lung function. Therefore, screening and evaluation of nutritional status as well as appropriate nutritional intervention should be emphasized in CF children.",
