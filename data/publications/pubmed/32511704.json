  "abstract": "We tested 104 residents and 141 staff for coronavirus disease 2019 who failed daily symptom screening in homeless shelters in Hamilton, Canada. We detected 1 resident (1%), 7 staff (5%), and 1 case of secondary spread. Shelter restructuring to allow physical distancing, testing, and isolation can decrease outbreaks in shelters.",
