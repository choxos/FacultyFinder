  "title": "Accidental substance-related acute toxicity deaths among youth in Canada: a descriptive analysis of a national chart review study of coroner and medical examiner data.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Substance-related acute toxicity deaths (ATDs) are a public health crisis in Canada. Youth are often at higher risk for substance use due to social, environmental and structural factors. The objectives of this study were to understand the characteristics of youth (aged 12-24 years) dying of accidental acute toxicity in Canada and examine the substances contributing to and circumstances surrounding youth ATDs. METHODS: Data from a national chart review study of coroner and medical examiner data on ATDs that occurred in Canada between 2016 and 2017 were used to conduct descriptive analyses with proportions, mortality rates and proportionate mortality rates. Where possible, youth in the chart review study were compared with youth in the general population and youth who died of all causes, using census data. RESULTS: Of the 732 youth who died of accidental acute toxicity in 2016-2017, most (94%) were aged 18 to 24 years. Youth aged 20 to 24 who were unemployed, unhoused or living in collective housing were overrepresented among accidental ATDs. Many of the youth aged 12 to 24 who died of accidental acute toxicity had a documented history of substance use. Fentanyl, cocaine and methamphetamine were the most common substances contributing to death, and 38% of the deaths were witnessed or potentially witnessed. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study point to the need for early prevention and harm reduction strategies and programs that address mental health, exposure to trauma, unemployment and housing instability to reduce the harms of substance use on Canadian youth.",
