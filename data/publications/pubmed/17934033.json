  "title": "Canadian Quality Circle pilot project in osteoporosis: rationale, methods, and feasibility.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: PROBLEM ADDRESSED Family physicians are not adequately following the 2002 Osteoporosis Canada guidelines for providing optimal care to patients with osteoporosis. OBJECTIVE OF PROGRAM: The Canadian Quality Circle (CQC) pilot project was developed to assess the feasibility of the CQC project design and to gather information for implementing a national study of quality circles (QCs). The national study would assess whether use ofQCs could improve family physicians' adherence to the osteoporosis guidelines. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The pilot project enrolled 52 family physicians and involved 7 QCs. The project had 3 phases: training and baseline data collection, educational intervention and follow-up data collection, and sessions on implementing strategies for care. CONCLUSION: Findings from the pilot study showed that the CQC project was well designed and well received. Use of QCs appeared to be feasible for transferring knowledge and giving physicians an opportunity to analyze work-related problems and develop solutions to them.",
