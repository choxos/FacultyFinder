  "title": "Novel lignin-chitosan-PVA composite hydrogel for wound dressing.",
  "abstract": "Although PVA-chitosan composite hydrogel has excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial ability, its poor mechanical strength limits its application for wound dressings. Furthermore, PVA-chitosan composite hydrogel cannot satisfy the requirements of wound dressing as an environmental conditioner to accelerate wound healing. In this work, a novel lignin-chitosan-PVA composite hydrogel was prepared as wound dressing. The introduction of lignin effectively improved the mechanical strength (tensile stress is up to 46.87 MPa), protein adsorption capacity, and wound environmental regulation ability of the hydrogel. In a murine wound model, the lignin-chitosan-PVA composite hydrogel significantly accelerated wound healing. The developed hydrogel provides new opportunities for highly efficient skin wound care and management.",
