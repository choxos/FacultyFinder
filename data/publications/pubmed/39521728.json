  "title": "A Digital Self-Administered Check-Up Assessment and Evaluation of Risk Communication in Older People.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital health tools can significantly contribute to the continuum of care and support for persons with their self-management role. Despite the increasing adoption of digital health tools, little is known about the uptake and comfort of use among older persons. METHODS: A mixed methods design was used to assess the feasibility and utility of the check-up (CU), a self-administered digital health assessment for older persons. For the older person, qualitative interviews and de-identified CU assessment data were collected. A focus group was held to gain the health provider perspective. RESULTS: A total of 32 online CU assessments were completed, and 17 individuals participated in interviews. Three main themes were identified: digital literacy and accessibility, communication of risk and role within the circle of care. CONCLUSION: Self-administered digital assessments are feasible for older adults. Strategies for adoption should focus on accessibility and collaboration with health professionals to maximise utility and understanding of assessment results.",
