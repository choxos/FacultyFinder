  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neovascular glaucoma (NVG) is a secondary refractory disease with a poor prognosis, and there are few advanced studies on its pathogenesis and treatment. In this research, the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) technology was used in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to investigate intrinsic neuron activity in the patient's brain with NVG. METHODS: Sixteen patients with NVG (eight males and eight females) and 16 healthy controls (HCs) of similar age and sex were included. All patients and controls received rsfMRI scans, and the differences between the two groups in fALFF values were compared by independent sample t-test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare fALFF values in the brain regions of NVG patients and HCs and assess accuracy. Finally, Pearson linear correlation analysis assessed the correlation between fALFF signals in brain regions and the clinical evaluation indicators of patients with NVG. RESULTS: In patients with NVG, fALFF signal values in the right Rolandic operculum, left anterior cingulate and paracingulate gyri, and right caudate were significantly decreased. In contrast, fALFF signal values in the left precuneus were significantly higher than those recorded in the HCs. Analysis of the ROC curve for each brain region showed that the area under the ROC curve of NVG patients was large (close to 1), and the accuracy was good. In the NVG group, the hospital anxiety and depression scale (r=-0.952, P<0.001) and left best-corrected visual acuity (r=-0.802, P<0.001) had a negative linear correlation with the fALFF signal value of the right Rolandic operculum. The hospital anxiety and depression scale had a negative linear correlation with the fALFF signal value of the right caudate (r=-0.948, P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: NVG patients showed dysfunction in several brain regions. These findings may assist in revealing the underlying neural mechanism of brain activity associated with NVG.",
