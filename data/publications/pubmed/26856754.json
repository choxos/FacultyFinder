  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Acute severe steroid-refractory ulcerative colitis (UC) carries a poor prognosis and requires optimal management. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess cyclosporine and infliximab (IFX) as rescue agents in patients with steroid-refractory UC. METHODS: A literature search identified studies that investigated IFX and cyclosporine in steroid-refractory UC patients. The primary outcome was short-term response to treatment. Secondary outcomes included the rates of colectomy at 3 months and 12 months, adverse drug reactions, post-operative complications in those who received rescue therapy but underwent colectomy subsequently, and mortality. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are reported. RESULTS: Overall, 16 studies with 1,473 participants were eligible for inclusion. Among three randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was seen with IFX compared with cyclosporine with regard to treatment response and 3- or 12-month colectomy. Among 13 non-randomized studies, IFX was associated with significantly higher rates of treatment response (OR 2.96 (95% CI 2.12-4.14, χ(2)=6.50, I(2)=0%)) and a lower 12-month colectomy rate (OR 0.42 (95% CI 0.22-0.83, χ(2)=30.94, I(2)=71%)), with no significant difference seen in the 3-month colectomy rate (OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.22-1.28, χ(2)=22.73, I(2)=69%)) compared with cyclosporine. There were no significant differences between IFX and cyclosporine in adverse drug-related events, post-operative complications, or mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In the management of steroid-refractory severe UC, no definitive difference between IFX and cyclosporine is demonstrated by randomized trials, but non-randomized studies suggest that IFX is associated with better treatment response and lower risk of colectomy at 12 months. Prospective studies comparing dose-optimized IFX with cyclosporine are needed.",
