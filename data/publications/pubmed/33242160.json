  "title": "Affirming Care for Sexual and Gender Minority Prostate Cancer Survivors: Results from an Online Training.",
  "abstract": "Sexual and gender minority people have unique, unaddressed healthcare needs following prostate cancer. The research team along with a group of established subject matter experts developed a training and companion materials for healthcare professionals to address this need. Post-assessment evaluation was reported in frequencies and percentages by combining results from learners who attended an original, live web-based training and learners who completed the same training on-demand via a Learning Management System. Learners from both the live and archived training reported that the training increased their knowledge to effectively work with sexual and gender minority prostate cancer survivors. Learners also reported gaining new resources and strategies they could apply to their work. Results indicate the training fills an educational gap for healthcare professionals and supports the need for additional training of healthcare professionals focused on the healthcare needs of SGM cancer survivors.",
