  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database is the largest congenital heart surgery database worldwide but does not provide information beyond primary episode of care. Linkage to hospital electronic health records would capture complications and comorbidities along with long-term outcomes for patients with CHD surgeries. The current study explores linkage success between Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database and electronic health record data in North Carolina and Georgia. METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database was linked to hospital electronic health records from four North Carolina congenital heart surgery using indirect identifiers like date of birth, sex, admission, and discharge dates, from 2008 to 2013. Indirect linkage was performed at the admissions level and compared to two other linkages using a \"direct identifier,\" medical record number: (1) linkage between Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database and electronic health records from a subset of patients from one North Carolina institution and (2) linkage between Society of Thoracic Surgeons data from two Georgia facilities and Georgia's CHD repository, which also uses direct identifiers for linkage. RESULTS: Indirect identifiers successfully linked 79% (3692/4685) of Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database admissions across four North Carolina hospitals. Direct linkage techniques successfully matched Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database to 90.2% of electronic health records from the North Carolina subsample. Linkage between Society of Thoracic Surgeons and Georgia's CHD repository was 99.5% (7,544/7,585). CONCLUSIONS: Linkage methodology was successfully demonstrated between surgical data and hospital-based electronic health records in North Carolina and Georgia, uniting granular procedural details with clinical, developmental, and economic data. Indirect identifiers linked most patients, consistent with similar linkages in adult populations. Future directions include applying these linkage techniques with other data sources and exploring long-term outcomes in linked populations.",
