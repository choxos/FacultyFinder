  "title": "Review of the potential pharmacological role of erucic acid: a monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid.",
  "abstract": "This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of the pharmacological properties of erucic acid (EA) and highlight areas that require further research. EA is an omega-9 fatty acid found in certain vegetable oil, such as rapeseed oil has demonstrated favourable effects in rodents, including ameliorating myocardial lipidosis (fat accumulation in the heart muscle), congestive heart disease, hepatic steatosis (fat accumulation in the liver), and memory impairments. These findings have prompted regulatory bodies to establish limits on EA content in food oils. The studies were performed on rodents and led to caution on ingesting the EA at high levels. Moreover, EA is frequently utilized as a nutritional supplement for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy, myocardial disease, and memory improvement. The review of the article indicated that EA improves cognitive function, has a part in Huntington's disease, interacts with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, inhibits elastase and thrombin, has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumour properties, and inhibits influenza A virus. This article elucidates the pharmacological effects of EA, an omega-9 fatty acid.",
