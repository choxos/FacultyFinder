  "title": "Use of non-warfarin oral anticoagulants instead of warfarin during left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: In the stroke prevention trials of left atrial appendage closure with the Watchman device (Boston Scientific), a postimplantation antithrombotic regimen of 6 weeks of warfarin was used. OBJECTIVE: Given the clinical complexity of warfarin use, the purpose of this study was to study the relative feasibility and safety of using non-warfarin oral anticoagulants (NOACs) instead of warfarin during the peri- and initial postimplantation periods after Watchman implantation. METHODS: This was a retrospective multicenter study of consecutive patients undergoing Watchman implantation and receiving peri- and postprocedural NOACs or warfarin. Transesophageal echocardiography or chest computed tomography was performed between 6 weeks and 4 months postimplant to assess for device-related thrombosis. Bleeding and thromboembolic events also were evaluated at the time of follow-up. RESULTS: In 5 centers, 214 patients received NOACs (46% apixaban, 46% rivaroxaban, 7% dabigatran, and 1% edoxaban) in either an uninterrupted (82%) or a single-held-dose (16%) fashion. Compared to a control group receiving uninterrupted warfarin (n = 212), the rates of periprocedural complications, including bleeding events, were similar (2.8% vs 2.4%, P = 1). At follow-up, the rates of device-related thrombosis (0.9% vs 0.5%, P = 1), composite of thromboembolism or device-related thrombosis (1.4% vs 0.9%, P = 1), and postprocedure bleeding events (0.5% vs 0.9%, P = .6) also were comparable between the NOAC and warfarin groups. CONCLUSION: NOACs proved to be a feasible peri- and postprocedural alternative regimen to warfarin for preventing device-related thrombosis and thromboembolic complications expected early after appendage closure with the Watchman device, without increasing the risk of bleeding.",
