  "title": "Factors associated with rates and durations of cord clamping practice compliance in preterm neonates of <33 weeks' gestation.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine maternal, neonatal, and hospital factors influencing deferred cord clamping (DCC) compliance rates in preterm neonates. METHODS: Neonates born <33 weeks' gestational age (GA) within the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Canadian Neonatal Network during 2018-2022 were included. Units' DCC quality improvement (QI) efforts were surveyed. The factors were stratified by <15 seconds (s) immediate cord clamping, 15-59 s early cord clamping, or ≥60 s DCC. RESULTS: Of 16,217 eligible neonates, only 45% received DCC ≥ 60 s. Maternal hypertension and antenatal steroid was asscoiated with higher DCC rates. Cesarean delivery (aOR 0.39, 95% CI 0.33-0.47), <26 weeks GA (aOR 0.25, 95% CI 0.21-0.30), and small-for-gestational-age status had lower DCC odds. Singleton birth, preterm labor, and fetal indications for delivery increased DCC likelihood. Hospital size and QI efforts did not impact DCC compliance. CONCLUSION: Extreme preterm neonates or cesarean delivery are actionable QI targets to improve DCC compliance and neonatal outcomes.",
