  "title": "Unclosing Premature Mortality Gap Among Patients With Gout in the US General Population, Independent of Serum Urate and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk Factors.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gout flares are followed by transient major cardiovascular (CV) risk, implicating the role of inflammation; the aim of this study was to determine whether premature mortality rates in patients with gout and CV risk are independent of serum urate (SU) and atherosclerotic CV disease (ASCVD) risk factors. METHODS: Using serial US nationwide prospective cohorts, we evaluated the independent association of prevalent gout with all-cause and CV mortality, adjusting for SU, ASCVD risk factors, comorbidities, medications, and kidney function and compared mortality rates between the early (1988-1994 baseline) and late cohorts (2007-2016 baseline). We replicated late cohort findings among patients with gout in a nationwide UK cohort (2006-2010 baseline). RESULTS: Adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality rates in patients with prevalent gout were similar in early and late US cohorts (1.20 [1.03-1.40] and 1.19 [1.04-1.37], respectively); HRs with further adjustment for SU were 1.19 (1.02-1.38) and 1.19 (1.03-1.37), respectively. Adjusted HR among patients with gout from the UK late cohort was 1.61 (1.47-1.75); these associations were larger among women (P =â€‰0.04) and prominent among Black individuals. Adjusted HR for CV mortality rates in the late US cohort was 1.39 (1.09-1.78); those for circulatory, CV, and coronary heart disease deaths among UK patients with incident gout were 1.48 (1.24-1.76), 1.49 (1.20-1.85), and 1.59 (1.26-1.99), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with gout experience a persistent mortality gap in all-cause and CV deaths, even adjusting for SU and ASCVD risk factors, supporting a role for gout-specific pathways (eg, flare inflammation). These findings suggest gaps in current care, particularly in women and possibly among Black patients.",
