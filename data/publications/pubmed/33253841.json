  "title": "Incidence of psoriasis among adults in the United States: A sex- and age-adjusted population analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Information on recent trends in overall and subgroup incidences in psoriasis is limited. OBJECTIVE: To estimate current incidence of psoriasis in the United States, compare incidences among demographic subgroups, and evaluate recent disease trends. METHODS: Retrospective cohort analysis of psoriasis patients identified with electronic health records between 2014 and 2018. RESULTS: Incidence rate in the overall population (n = 2,152,192) was 63.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 61.8-65.8) per 100,000 person-years. Incidence increased with age and peaked among individuals aged 70 to 79 years (92.3 [95% CI 85.1-100.0] per 100,000 person-years). Incidence was similar between men (62.8 [95% CI 59.8-65.9] per 100,000 person-years) and women (64.8 [95% CI 62.2-67.4] per 100,000 person-years). Standardized incidence rate for Whites (75.3 [95% CI 72.7-78.0] per 100,000 person-years) was greater than that for Hispanic/Latino patients (52.2 [95% CI 44.9-60.3] per 100,000 person-years; P < .001), patients of other race (54.3 [95% CI 46.5-62.9] per 100,000 person-years; P < .001), and Blacks (24.9 [95% CI 21.4-28.8] per 100,000 person-years; P < .001). Incidence appears to be stable within a recent 5-year period. LIMITATIONS: Estimates were derived from approximately 15% of the health care-seeking US population. CONCLUSION: Psoriasis incidence in the United States appears to increase with age, is similar between sexes, and is greatest among Whites.",
