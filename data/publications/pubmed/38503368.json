  "title": "Polymerization strategy for cellulose nanocrystals-based photonic crystal films with water resisting property.",
  "abstract": "Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) can form a liquid crystal film with a chiral nematic structure by evaporative-induced self-assembly (EISA). It has attracted much attention as a new class of photonic liquid crystal material because of its intrinsic, unique structural characteristics, and excellent optical properties. However, the CNCs-based photonic crystal films are generally prepared via the physical crosslinking strategy, which present water sensitivity. Here, we developed CNCs-g-PAM photonic crystal film by combining free radical polymerization and EISA. FT-IR, SEM, POM, XRD, TG-DTG, and UV-Vis techniques were employed to characterize the physicochemical properties and microstructure of the as-prepared films. The CNCs-g-PAM films showed a better thermo-stability than CNCs-based film. Also, the mechanical properties were significantly improved, viz., the elongation at break was 9.4 %, and tensile strength reached 18.5 Mpa, which was a much better enhancement than CNCs-based film. More importantly, the CNCs-g-PAM films can resist water dissolution for more than 24 h, which was impossible for the CNCs-based film. The present study provided a promising strategy to prepare CNCs-based photonic crystal film with high flexibility, water resistance, and optical properties for applications such as decoration, light management, and anti-counterfeiting.",
