  "abstract": "Levofloxacin is a fluoroquinolone antibiotic commonly used to treat respiratory, urinary tract, skin and soft-tissue infections. Levofloxacin is generally well tolerated and has fewer reported side effects than other fluoroquinolones. We present a case of levofloxacin-associated severe hepatocellular injury. The hepatitis resolved soon after discontinuation of levofloxacin.",
