  "title": "Placebos: our most effective therapy?",
  "abstract": "Placebos remain highly controversial therapies largely because of their widespread use in research as a comparator rather than a focus of analysis. While a recent systematic review of placebo versus no therapy arms in trials found no difference, the placebo effect in some areas of drug trial research is large and increasing. We attempt to explain this paradox and suggest how clinicians may use the placebo effect to advantage.",
