  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) is a major complication of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH); it is associated with high risks of cerebral palsy and cognitive deficits compared with infants without PHVD. This study aims to explore the early perinatal risk factors-associated with the risk of progressive PHVD. METHODS: Neonates ≤29 weeks gestational age (GA) with Grade II-III IVH and periventricular hemorrhagic infarct (PVHI) between 2015 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. All cranial ultrasounds done within 14 days postnatal age (PNA) were assessed for grade of IVH, anterior horn width (AHW), ventricular index (VI), and thalamo-occipital index (TOD). The outcome was defined as death of any cause or VI and/or AHW and/or TOD ≥ moderate-risk zone based on an ultrasound done beyond two weeks PNA. RESULTS: A total of 146 infants with a mean GA of 26 ± 1.8 weeks, birth weight 900 ± 234 g were included, 46% were females. The primary outcome occurred in 56 (39%) infants; among them 17 (30%) and 11 (20%) needed ventricular reservoir and shunt insertion, respectively. The risk factors present within 14 days PNA that significantly increased the odds of developing PHVD were hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus (odds ratio [OR] 6.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9 to 22), culture-proven sepsis (OR 5.4, 95% CI 1.8 to 18), Grade III IVH (OR 4.6, 95% CI 1.1 to 22), PVHI (OR 3.0, 95% CI 0.9 to 10), and VI (OR 2.1, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.9). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical predictors such as significant ductus arteriosus and bacterial septicemia, along with risk levels of AHW and VI measured with early cranial ultrasounds, are potential predictors of subsequent onset of PHVD.",
