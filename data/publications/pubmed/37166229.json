  "title": "A systematic review examining the effect of vitamin D supplementation on functional outcomes post-stroke.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to explore the effect of vitamin D supplementation on functional outcomes (motor function, mobility, activities of daily living and stroke impairment) among individuals post-stroke (PROSPERO CRD42022296462). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched for all articles published up to March 5, 2023. METHODS: Only interventional studies assessing vitamin D supplementation compared to placebo or usual care in adult stroke patients were selected. After duplicate removal, 2912 studies were screened by two independent reviewers. A total of 43 studies underwent full text review; 10 studies met inclusion criteria (8 randomized controlled trials and 2 non-randomized studies of intervention). Data were extracted by two independent reviewers using Covidence software. Motor function (Brunnstrom Recovery Stage, Berg Balance Score), mobility (Functional Ambulation Category), activities of daily living (Barthel Index, Functional Independence Measure) and stroke impairment (modified Rankin Scale, National Institutes for Health Stroke Severity, Scandinavian Stroke Severity) were the outcome measures of interest reported in the included studies. RESULTS: In total, 691 patients were studied for which 11 of 13 outcome measures showed improvement with vitamin D supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of studies showed a statistical improvement in motor function, mobility, and stroke impairment with vitamin D supplementation; however, the evidence did not support an improvement in activities of daily living with treatment. Despite this, there may not be clinical significance. Strong, methodologically sound, randomized controlled trials are required to verify these findings.",
