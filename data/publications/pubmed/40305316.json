  "abstract": "Pediatric genetic counseling consistently has the longest referral to appointment time among all genetic counseling specialties. Pediatric genetic counselors (GCs) are utilizing non-traditional clinic models (NTM) in their practices. This study identified the clinic models utilized by GCs and describes GCs' perceptions regarding clinic model use and implementation. Pediatric GCs were recruited via the National Society of Genetic Counselors student research email. Descriptive statistics were used to describe respondent demographics, clinic model types utilized, average monthly patient volume, and genetic counselor perceptions of their clinic model, including barriers, helpful resources, and perceived improvements with NTM implementation. Of the 78 respondents, 80.8% of pediatric GCs were working in a NTM role at least some of the time. The average monthly patient volume was higher for GCs exclusively in NTM and combination clinic roles versus GCs solely in traditional model (TM) roles. The genetic counseling-only clinic was the NTM utilized most among NTM and combination GCs. A higher proportion of GCs working with NTMs agreed they were satisfied with their job, felt supported in the clinic, were at the top of their scope, and provided better patient care than TM GCs. Barriers exist to NTM implementation, and the process was not standardized across clinics. This study provides preliminary evidence showing NTM use can increase pediatric GC patient volume while increasing job satisfaction.",
