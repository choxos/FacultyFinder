  "title": "Respiratory sequelae of dengue fever.",
  "abstract": "Dengue viral illness is endemic in many tropical countries with temperate climates. The haematological and cardiovascular sequelae of dengue are well known; however, respiratory manifestations are still an area of active medical research. We conducted a literature search on PubMed, Medline CINAHIL, EMBASE and found 64 articles on respiratory sequelae of dengue. All relevant original articles and case reports were included and the relevant information regarding the respiratory manifestations of dengue was retrieved from the relevant eligible articles. Respiratory manifestations of dengue range from mild pleural effusion to acute respiratory distress syndrome. The former was the most common complication, seen in 5.1% of patients, followed by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 1.7%, pneumonia in 0.5%, respiratory distress in 0.3%, pulmonary hemorrhage in 0.1%, and haemothorax in 0.01%. Involvement of the respiratory system indicates severe disease and is difficult to manage. Therefore its early detection is important.",
