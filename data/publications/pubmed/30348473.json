  "title": "Thoracic impalement injury: A survivor with large metallic object in-situ.",
  "abstract": "Impalement injuries, is a severe form of trauma, which are not common in civilian life. These injuries rarely occurs in major accidents. Abdomen, chest, limbs and perineum are often involved due to their large surface area. Thoracic impalement injury is usually a fatal injury, due to location of major vessels and heart in the thoracic cavity. These injuries are horrifying to site, but the patients who are lucky enough to make it to hospital, usually survive. Chances of survival are larger in right sided impalement injuries while central injuries are always died at the scene. Our patient, 25 years old male, was brought to the emergency room (ER) with large impaled metallic bar (about 2.5 feet long) in situ, in right sided chest. The patient was immediately shifted to operation room (OR) and was operated, his recovery was uneventful without any sequelae. Such patients should be treated and resuscitated according to advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocols and operated without any delay for further investigations. Such operations are carried out by the most experienced surgeon team available. The impaled objects should not be processed if not necessary to avoid major hemorrhage and damage to vital structures, until the patient is in operation room. Large size and unusual position of impaled objects, makes the job difficult for surgeons/anesthetists. Although horrifying at scene, patients with thoracic impalement injuries are mostly young and healthy, and those who survive the pre-hospital phase are potentially manageable with proper resuscitation. Usually these patients make recovery without any further complications.",
