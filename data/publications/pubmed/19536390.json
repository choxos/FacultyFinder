  "title": "A review of the cost of cardiovascular disease.",
  "abstract": "In Canada, 74,255 deaths (33% of all deaths) in 2003 were due to cardio-vascular disease (CVD). As one of the most costly diseases, CVD represents a major economic burden on health care systems. The purpose of the present study was to review the literature on the economic costs of CVD in Canada and other developed countries (United States, Europe and Australia) published from 1998 to 2006, with a focus on Canada. Of 1656 screened titles and abstracts, 34 articles were reviewed including six Canadian studies and 17 American studies. While considerable variation was observed among studies, all studies indicated that the costs of treating CVD-related conditions are significant, outlining a convincing case for CVD prevention programs.",
