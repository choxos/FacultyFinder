  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To identify the accuracy of a camera-enabled mobile phone in assessing patients with nasal bone injuries and to determine if treatment in the form of manipulation of the nasal bones and therefore outpatient attendance was necessary. METHODS: Prospective study of patients with nasal injuries attending the weekly ear-nose-throat emergency clinic. The patient is assessed and examined, and a preset questionnaire is filled out. An anteroposterior photograph and an overhead photograph of the nose are taken. The pictures are then e-mailed to a senior member of the team who reviews the pictures and determines based on the images whether intervention in the form of manipulation of nasal bones was required. The results were then compared with the actual assessment and management in the clinic. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients assessed, 94% showed a direct correlation between the perceived need for treatment based on the clinical images and the actual management in the outpatient clinic. The results also showed the test to be 88% specific and 100% sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the use of a mobile phone camera to assess nasal bone injuries could be a useful triage tool in correctly identifying patients who may require intervention in the form of nasal bone manipulation.",
