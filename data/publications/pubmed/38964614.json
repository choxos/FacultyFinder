  "title": "Discovery of hepatitis B virus subviral particle biogenesis inhibitors from a bioactive compound library.",
  "abstract": "High levels of hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) in the blood of chronic HBV carriers are considered to drive the exhaustion of antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes and thus responsible for the persistence of infection. Accordingly, therapeutic elimination of HBsAg may facilitate the activation of adaptive antiviral immune responses against HBV and achieve a functional cure of chronic hepatitis B. We discovered recently that an amphipathic alpha helix spanning W156 to R169 of HBV small envelope (S) protein plays an essential role in the morphogenesis of subviral particles (SVPs) and metabolism of S protein. We thus hypothesized that pharmacological disruption of SVP morphogenesis may induce intracellular degradation of S protein and reduce HBsAg secretion. To identify inhibitors of SVP biogenesis, we screened 4417 bioactive compounds with a HepG2-derived cell line expressing HBV S protein and efficiently secreting small spherical SVPs. The screen identified 24 compounds that reduced intracellular SVPs and secreted HBsAg in a concentration-dependent manner. However, 18 of those compounds inhibited the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg in HBV replicon transfected HepG2 cells at similar efficiency, suggesting each of those compounds may disrupt a common cellular function required for the synthesis and/or secretion of these viral proteins. Interestingly, lycorine more efficiently inhibited the secretion of HBsAg in HepG2 cells transfected with HBV replicons, HepG2.2.15 cells and HBV infected - HepG2 cells expressing sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). The structure activity relationship and antiviral mechanism of lycorine against HBV have been determined.",
