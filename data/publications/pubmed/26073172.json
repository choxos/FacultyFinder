  "title": "Emergency department clinical redesign, team-based care and improvements in hospital performance: A time series analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the impact of an ED clinical redesign project that involved team-based care and early senior assessment on hospital performance. METHODS: This was an interrupted time series analysis performed using daily hospital performance data 6 months before and 8 months after the implementation of the clinical redesign intervention that involved Emergency Consultant-led team-based care, redistribution of ED beds and implementation of a senior nursing coordination roles in the ED. The primary outcome was the daily National Emergency Access Target (NEAT) performance (proportion of total daily ED presentations that were admitted to an inpatient ward or discharged from ED within 4â€‰h of arrival). Secondary outcomes were daily ALOS in ED, inpatient Clinical Emergency Response System (CERS) calls and hospital mortality. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average analysis was used to model NEAT performance. Hospital mortality was modelled using negative binomial regression. RESULTS: After adjusting for patient volume, inpatient admissions, ambulance, hospital occupancy, weekends ED Consultant numbers, weekends and underlying trends, there was a 17% improvement in NEAT associated with the post-intervention period (95% CI 12, 19% P < 0.001). There was no change in the number of CERS calls and the median daily hospital mortality rate reduced from 1.04% to 0.96% (P = 0.025). CONCLUSION: An ED-focused clinical redesign project was associated with a 17% improvement in NEAT performance with no evidence of an increase in clinical deterioration on inpatient wards and evidence for an improvement in hospital mortality.",
