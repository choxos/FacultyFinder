  "title": "ARIA 2019 Care Pathways for Allergic Rhinitis in the Kuwait Health Care System.",
  "abstract": "A worldwide increase in prevalence of allergic diseases has led to adaptations in national and international health care systems. ARIA (Allergic Rhinitis and Its Impact on Asthma) initiative develops internationally applicable guidelines for allergic respiratory diseases. In collaboration with international initiatives, ARIA offers updates of real-life integrated care pathways (ICPs) for digitally assisted, integrated, and individualized treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). This article presents certain aspects of the health care system in Kuwait with reference to the management of AR and the objective of introducing ICPs and adopting the latest ARIA recommendations. Guidelines for ICPs include aspects of patients and health care providers and cover key areas of management of AR. This model of guidelines supports real-life health care better than traditional models. ARIA recommendations will be locally integrated in the health care system with the aim of improving both pharmacotherapy and allergy immunotherapy.",
