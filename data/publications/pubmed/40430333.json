  "title": "Advances in Superlattice Hydrogen Storage Alloys: Preparation Method, Phase Structure Modulation, and Hydrogen Storage Performance.",
  "abstract": "Superlattice hydrogen storage alloys have attracted much attention due to their high capacity, excellent cyclic stability, and moderate operating conditions. This review, focusing on journal articles published between 2020 and 2025, comprehensively covers the impacts of doping with different rare-earth elements and the substitution of different elements on superlattice hydrogen storage alloys and details the influence mechanisms of different preparation methods, such as arc melting and powder metallurgy, on the phase structure of alloys. A thorough analysis is conducted on how rare-earth element doping alters the crystal structure, lattice parameters, and phase stability of alloys, thereby affecting their hydrogen storage performance. Meanwhile, the differences in the effects of different substituting elements at various substitution sites on the phase structure and hydrogen storage performance of alloys are explored, and the regular patterns and influencing factors are summarized. This review provides a new perspective for the design and development of high-performance superlattice hydrogen storage alloys and is expected to contribute to the long-term and sustainable development of clean hydrogen energy.",
