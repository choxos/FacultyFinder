  "title": "Treatment regimens for optimising outcomes in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.",
  "abstract": "Practice patterns for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) have evolved from the landmark registration trials of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Non-monthly regimens like treat-and-extend (T&E) have become popular due to their effectiveness in clinical practice. T&E regimens attempt to limit the burden of visits and treatments by allowing progressively longer treatment intervals, but in so doing, are potentially associated with the expense of treating quiescent disease. This is acceptable to many patients and their ophthalmologists but can still be problematic in the real-world. Recent studies have further refined the T&E approach by allowing for quicker and longer extension of treatment intervals when less severe disease is detected. With newer drugs offering increased durability, a shift to longer regular intervals may emerge as a new practice pattern for VEGF inhibitor therapy. This review aims to consolidate the current literature on the most effective treatment patterns and update treatment guidelines based on options that are now available. It also summarises new aspects of nAMD management that may help to further refine current practice.",
