  "title": "Comparative analysis of calcification parameters with Agatston Score approximations for ex vivo atherosclerotic lesions.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Agatston Calcium Score is a predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events but it is unable to identify high-risk lesions. Recent research suggests that examining calcification phenotype could be more indicative of plaque stability. OBJECTIVE: To examine the Agatston score's ability to determine atherosclerotic calcification phenotype. METHODS: Micro-Computed Tomography was performed on 20 carotid and 20 peripheral lower limb lesions. ImageJ pixel histogram analysis quantified the non-calcified (≥30HU, <130HU) and calcified (≥130HU) tissue volumes. ImageJ '3D Objects Counter' plugin determined the calcified particle count, volumes and maximum attenuation density of each particle. Image stacks were subsequently downsampled to a resolution of 0.7 × 0.7 × 3 mm and an approximation for the Extra-Coronary Calcium Scores (ECCS) were calculated. Spearman's correlation examined the relationships between ECCS approximations and calcification parameters. RESULTS: ECCS has a strong positive correlation with the Calcified Volume Fraction (CVF) (rs = 0.865, p < 0.0005), weak positive correlations with Calcified Particle Fraction (CPF) (rs = 0.422, p = 0.007) and Microcalcification Fraction (micro-CF) (rs = 0.361, p = 0.022). There is no correlation evident between ECCS and Calcified Particle Index (CPI) (rs = -0.162, p = 0.318). It is apparent that there is a high prevalence of microcalcifications in both carotid and peripheral lower limb lesions. Additionally, an inverse relationship exists between calcified particle volume and maximum-recorded attenuation density. CONCLUSION: The density-weighted Agatston calcium scoring methodology needs to be reviewed. Calcium scoring which differentiates between critical calcification morphologies, rather than presenting a density-weighted score, is required to direct high-risk plaques towards tailored treatment.",
