  "title": "Five-Year Outcomes After Arthroscopic Surgery for Femoroacetabular Impingement Syndrome in Elite Athletes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Femoroacetabular impingement syndrome (FAIS) is a common cause of hip pain and disability in athletes. Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS is well-established; however, the long-term results in elite athletes are limited. PURPOSE: To evaluate outcomes 5 years after arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes. STUDY DESIGN: Case series; Level of evidence, 4. METHODS: Elite athletes undergoing arthroscopic treatment for FAIS with a minimum 5-year follow-up were included. They were prospectively followed up with patient-reported outcome measures. An elite athlete was defined as having a Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS) level of 7 or 8 before the onset of symptoms. Preoperatively and 5 years after surgery, all athletes completed a web-based questionnaire, including the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (comprising 6 subscales), the EQ-5D and EQ-VAS (European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions Questionnaire and European Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale), iHOT-12 (International Hip Outcome Tool), a visual analog scale for hip function, and the HSAS. Moreover, patients reported their overall satisfaction with their hip function. Preoperative measurements were compared with the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: A total of 64 elite athletes (52 men, 12 women) with a mean ± SD age of 24 ± 6 years were included. On average, patients reported a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement from preoperative patient-reported outcome measures to the 5-year follow-up (P < .0003), Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score subscales (symptoms, 51.7 vs 71.9; pain, 61.0 vs 81.1; function of daily living, 67.1 vs 83.6; function in sports and recreation, 40.0 vs 71.5; participation in physical activity, 25.0 vs 67.4; hip and groin-related quality of life, 34.4 vs 68.0), EQ-5D (0.60 vs 0.83), EQ-VAS (66.1 vs 76.7), and iHOT-12 (40.0 vs 68.8). At the 5-year follow-up, 90.5% reported satisfaction with their overall hip function. In total, 54% still participated in competitive sports (HSAS, 5-8) at follow-up, while 77% had decreased their level. Older patients and patients with longer duration of symptoms reported a significantly lower level of sports activity (HSAS, 0-4; P < .009). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic treatment for FAIS in elite athletes results in a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement regarding symptoms, hip function, quality of life, and pain 5 years after surgery. Approximately half of the cohort was still in competitive sports at follow-up, yet 77% had decreased their level of sports. Nine of 10 patients were satisfied with their surgery.",
