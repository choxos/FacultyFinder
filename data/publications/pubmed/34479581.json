  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) has shown effectiveness in treating bone metastases to alleviate pain. The benefit of SBRT may be further harnessed especially when radiating disease from primary malignancies with low alpha-beta ratios in order to maximize the magnitude and durability of pain relief. However, such an approach has not been studied in a prospective trial. We look to assess single-fraction SBRT for painful non-spinal bone metastases from radioresistant primaries. METHODS: Forty patients will be enrolled on an open label, phase II single arm trial to receive a single fraction of SBRT (15-20 Gray) to all sites of bone metastases requiring treatment for pain relief. Eligible patients will include those with primary malignancies consisting of prostate cancer, breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or melanoma. The primary endpoint is pain response at 3 months post-treatment using the Brief Pain Inventory. Secondary endpoints include pain response at 1 month and 6 months post-treatment, toxicity, patient-reported quality of life, re-irradiation or salvage surgery, and local control. DISCUSSION: This study will evaluate the efficacy of single-fraction SBRT on painful bone metastases from primary cancers with low alpha-beta ratios. These data will be valuable to promote future randomized trials and support clinical implementation. Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT04177056.
