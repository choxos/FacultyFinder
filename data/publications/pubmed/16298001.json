  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility whether intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) can be used to reduce doses to normal lung than three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3 DCRT) in treating distal esophageal malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten patient cases with cancer of the distal esophagus were selected for a retrospective treatment-planning study. IMRT plans using four, seven, and nine beams (4B, 7B, and 9B) were developed for each patient and compared with the 3 DCRT plan used clinically. IMRT and 3 DCRT plans were evaluated with respect to PTV coverage and dose-volumes to irradiated normal structures, with statistical comparison made between the two types of plans using the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test. RESULTS: IMRT plans (4B, 7B, 9B) reduced total lung volume treated above 10 Gy (V(10)), 20 Gy (V(20)), mean lung dose (MLD), biological effective volume (V(eff)), and lung integral dose (P<0.05). The median absolute improvement with IMRT over 3DCRT was approximately 10% for V(10), 5% for V(20), and 2.5 Gy for MLD. IMRT improved the PTV heterogeneity (P<0.05), yet conformity was better with 7B-9B IMRT plans. No clinically meaningful differences were observed with respect to the irradiated volumes of spinal cord, heart, liver, or total body integral doses. CONCLUSIONS: Dose-volume of exposed normal lung can be reduced with IMRT, though clinical investigations are warranted to assess IMRT treatment outcome of esophagus cancers.",
