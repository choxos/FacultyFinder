  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic vitreous hemorrhage (DVH) is a common complication of diabetes. While the diagnostic methods nowadays only concentrate on the eye injury in DVH patients, whether DVH leads to abnormalities of other visual systems, including the eye, the visual cortex, and other brain regions, remains unknown. AIM: To explore the potential changes of brain activity in DVH using regional homogeneity (ReHo) and their relationships with clinical features. METHODS: Thirty-one DVH patients and 31 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. All subjects were examined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. The neural homogeneity in the brain region was estimated by ReHo method. Pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between average ReHo values and clinical manifestations in DVH patients. RESULTS: Compared with HCs, the ReHo values in the bilateral cerebellar posterior lobes, right superior (RS)/middle occipital gyrus (MOG), and bilateral superior frontal gyrus were significantly increased. In contrast, in the right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyri, and right middle frontal gyrus, the ReHo values were significantly decreased. Furthermore, we found that best-corrected visual acuity of the contralateral eye in patients with DVH presented a positive correlation with the mean ReHo value of the RS/MOG. We also found that depression score of the DVH group presented a negative correlation with the mean ReHo values of the right insula, bilateral medial frontal gyrus, and right middle frontal gyrus. CONCLUSION: We found that DVH may cause dysfunction in multiple brain areas, which may benefit the exploration of pathologic mechanisms in DVH patients.",
