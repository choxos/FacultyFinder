  "title": "Comorbid anxiety disorders and divalproex sodium use among partial hospital patients with psychotic disorders.",
  "abstract": "We conducted this study to determine anxiety disorder comorbidity and divalproex sodium use among 26 patients with psychotic disorders after their referral to a partial hospital. Each subject was diagnosed by structured interview, and 4 Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) items associated with agitation were assessed: anxiety, hostility, excitement, and tension. Subjects' medical records were then examined to determine discharge diagnoses from referring inpatient facilities as well as current medication use. Although we diagnosed many anxiety disorders, none was identified during hospitalization. Divalproex use was not associated with anxiety disorder frequency. Divalproex patients had significantly lower BPRS anxiety, tension, and excitement scores, as well as total BPRS agitation scores (P < .05). Our findings suggest that anxiety disorders are unrecognized among psychotic patients and that treatment guidelines for concurrent anxiety are needed.",
