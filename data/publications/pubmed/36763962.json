  "abstract": "Background: Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease that mostly affects populations in tropical and subtropical countries. In Ghana, cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is the most common form of the disease affecting communities of the Volta Region. Conventional parasitological method (microscopy) is the commonly used test for CL diagnosis in many endemic countries, but has low sensitivity in chronic cases. Therefore, there is a clear need for a sensitive and easy-to-use point-of-care diagnostic method like an isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification-lateral flow (RPA-LF) test, suitable for use in austere and low-resource settings for the identification of CL cases. This study compared the efficacy of RPA-LF test with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in detecting Leishmania in suspected CL cases from the Volta Region. Methods: Twenty-five participants between 5 and 14 years were enrolled in the study from whom a total of 26 samples were obtained. Lesion samples were collected using FTA[Â®] filter papers applied to ulcerated lesions for molecular diagnosis. DNA isolated from filter papers was used for both the RPA-LF test and qPCR. Results: Twenty-two participants (88%) presented with one or two ulcerated active lesions per individual, while the rest of them had plaques or dried lesions. Among the 26 samples, 19/26 (73%) had concordant results when comparing the two diagnostic methods. Conclusion: Data from this study suggest that the RPA-LF test can be used in addition to a conventional parasitological diagnostic test (microscopy) to detect CL cases in communities of the Volta Region.",
