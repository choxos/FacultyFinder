  "title": "The safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol in the treatment of iron deficiency: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ferumoxytol is an intravenous (IV) iron formulation for treatment of iron deficiency (ID) that faced post-marketing reports of serious adverse events (SAEs). OBJECTIVES: To determine the safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol compared to other iron formulations and placebo. METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, Medline, and EMBASE from inception until February 2018 as well as trial registries and reference lists of relevant articles for randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials. RESULTS: The review included nine studies with 5691 participants. Studies were at low risk of bias. When comparing ferumoxytol to other IV iron formulations, there is moderate quality evidence (QE) of little to no difference in treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) (risk ratio [RR] 0.88, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.97), treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88), SAEs (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.77-1.67), hypotension or hypersensitivity reactions (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.31-1.09), or composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.24-1.29), low QE of little to no difference in related SAEs (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.05-6.16), and high QE of little to no difference in the number of patients with an increase in hemoglobin by at least 1 g/dL (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96-1.12). Ferumoxytol had less TEAEs compared to oral iron (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-0.98), but more compared to placebo (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.01-2.61). DISCUSSION: Ferumoxytol is as efficacious and safe as alternative IV iron formulations with no clear safety concerns.",
