  "title": "Severe Neuroinvasive West Nile Virus in Association With Anti-CD20 Monotherapy for Multiple Sclerosis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to report on the development of neuroinvasive West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the context of anti-CD20 monotherapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). METHODS: This is a case series study. RESULTS: In 2021-2022, we observed 4 cases of neuroinvasive WNV infection in our patient population of 2009 patients with MS on ocrelizumab, compared with a total of 46 cases of neuroinvasive WNV infection reported in Pennsylvania and 40 in New Jersey. Odds were 258 times that of the general population (95% confidence interval 97-691), Ï‡[2] p < 0.0001). All were women aged 41-61 years with variable disease duration, level of disability, and duration of anti-CD20 therapy. All presented in summer/early fall with fever, headache, and encephalopathy consistent with meningoencephalitis. Three patients had acute cerebellitis. Two had anterior nerve root involvement progressing to quadriparesis, and 1 developed refractory nonconvulsive status epilepticus. All required intubation and experienced significant morbidity. All had CSF pleocytosis. Two patients were WNV IgM positive in both the serum and CSF, 1 patient had positive serum IgM and CSF metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS), while 1 had positive CSF mNGS with negative serum and CSF antibodies. DISCUSSION: Neuroinvasive WNV infection can develop with anti-CD20 monotherapy in the absence of additional immunosuppression. WNV serologies may be negative in the setting of anti-CD20 treatment; in the appropriate clinical context, one should consider direct detection methods such as PCR or mNGS-based testing.",
