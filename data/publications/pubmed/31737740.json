  "abstract": "Cryptococcus gattii represents an emerging fungal pathogen of immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts in the United States. To our knowledge, this is the first case of posttransplant immune reconstitution syndrome due to C. gattii meningoencephalitis successfully treated with corticosteroids. We also report successful maintenance phase treatment with isavuconazole, a novel triazole, following fluconazole-induced prolonged QT syndrome.",
