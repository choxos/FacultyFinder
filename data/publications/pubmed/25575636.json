  "title": "Polymerase gamma mutator mice rely on increased glycolytic flux for energy production.",
  "abstract": "Several studies have illustrated that the polymerase gamma mutator (PolG) mice have reduced mitochondrial content secondary to systemic mitochondrial dysfunction, and subsequently a lower capacity to perform aerobic respiration and endurance exercise. We sought to delineate the extent of glycolysis as a means of energy production in the PolG mice in the absence of optimal mitochondrial function. PolG mice display an enhanced reliance on glycolysis as compared to their wild-type counterparts. This is evident by the resting hypoglycemia, higher PFK content, and elevated plasma lactate levels in the PolG mice. In vitro experiments provide further proof that PolG derived dermal fibroblasts have a higher rate of, and capacity for, glycolysis. PolG mice also have enhanced capacity to perform hepatic gluconeogenesis that is likely enhancing the Cori cycle capacity.",
