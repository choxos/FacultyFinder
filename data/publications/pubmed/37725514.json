  "title": "Postsecondary Students' Knowledge of and Adherence to the 2019 Canada's Food Guide: A Cross-sectional Pilot Survey.",
  "abstract": "Purpose: We conducted a pilot survey among young adults attending a suburban Canadian university to understand: (1) knowledge of the 2019 Canada's Food Guide (CFG); (2) self-reported food choices and eating habits; (3) perceived influence of the CFG on food choices and eating habits; and (4) suggestions to improve engagement with CFG.Methods: Students were recruited, through posts on social media platforms, to complete an online questionnaire between 7 March and 6 April 2020.Results: One-hundred and twenty-one (70% women) students responded. One-third (33%) of women and 8% of men reported consuming the recommended proportion of vegetables and fruits (i.e., 40%-60% of the plate) at their most recent meal (P = 0.001). Men were more likely to report overconsuming protein foods than women (58% vs 32%, P = 0.005). The perceived influence of the CFG on food choices and eating habits was low, with a mean score 2.2 Â± 1.4 out of 7, with 7 indicating \"highly influential.\" Over 92% of participants believed awareness of the CFG could be improved through social media platforms.Conclusions: Although half of the participants correctly answered all 8 questions that assessed knowledge of the CFG, there is an opportunity for dietitians and related health professionals to improve engagement with CFG.",
