  "title": "Stemless reverse total shoulder arthroplasty: a systematic review of short- and mid-term results.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Stemless reverse total shoulder arthroplasty is used to treat rotator cuff deficient arthropathies, rheumatoid arthritis, and osteoarthritis. It has several advantages over the stemmed implant including preservation of bone stock, reduced surgical time, and easier revision. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and CENTRAL to retrieve all relevant studies evaluating stemless reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. RESULTS: The literature search identified 1993 studies out of which 7 studies were included in this review; 324 patients underwent stemless reverse total shoulder arthroplasty with a weighted mean age of 74.1 (SD = 8.6, range = 38 to 93) years and a weighted mean follow-up time of 44 (SD = 6.6, range = 3 to 95) months. The included studies reported significant improvements in range of motion and functional scores comparable to stemmed reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. The weight mean flexion and abduction was (135 ± 12)° and (131 ± 12)° post-operatively, respectively. The weighted mean constant score increased from (26.7 ± 5.2) Patients (pts) to (63.0 ± 8.0) pts post-operatively. Overall complication and revision rate were 12.3% and 5.2%. CONCLUSION: Early and mid-term results indicate stemless reverse total shoulder arthroplasty has similar clinical outcomes to stemmed reverse total shoulder arthroplasty. There was no radiological evidence of humeral loosening at the latest follow-up.",
