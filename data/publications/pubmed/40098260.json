  "title": "Risk for Unplanned Pregnancy Among Survivors of Childhood Cancer.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to identify factors associated with risk for unplanned pregnancy in sexually active female survivors using self-report survey data. Risk for unplanned pregnancy was defined as using less effective/no contraception while also not desiring pregnancy. Of N = 160 participants (age 24.0 Â± 3.1 years), 33.1% were at-risk for unplanned pregnancy. On multivariable analysis, participants were less likely to be categorized at-risk for unplanned pregnancy if they reported diagnosis of ovarian failure/premature menopause (odds ratio [OR] 0.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.72, p = 0.032), greater concerns about fertility (OR 0.59, 95%CI 0.43-0.80, p = 0.001), and religious identity of agnostic/atheist (compared with Christian, OR 0.10, 95%CI 0.01-0.41, p = 0.005).",
