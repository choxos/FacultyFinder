  "title": "Pregnancy as a risk factor for severe outcomes from influenza virus infection: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pregnancy is considered to be an important risk factor for severe complications following influenza virus infection. As a consequence, WHO recommendations prioritize pregnant women over other risk groups for influenza vaccination. However, the risk associated with pregnancy has not been systematically quantified. PURPOSE: Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that reported on pregnancy as a risk factor for severe outcomes from influenza virus infection. DATA SOURCE: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and CENTRAL up to April 2014. DATA SELECTION: Studies reporting on outcomes in pregnant women with influenza in comparison to non-pregnant patients with influenza. Outcomes included community-acquired pneumonia, hospitalization, admission to intensive care units (ICU), ventilatory support, and death. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers conducted independent screening and data extraction. A random effects model was used to obtain risk estimates. Ecological studies were summarized descriptively. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 142 non-ecological and 10 ecological studies were included. The majority of studies (n=136, 95.8%) were conducted during the 2009 influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic. There was a higher risk for hospitalization in pregnant versus non-pregnant patients infected with influenza (odds ratio [OR] 2.44, 95% CI 1.22-4.87), but no significant difference in mortality (OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.81-1.33) or other outcomes. Ecologic studies confirmed the association between hospitalization risk and pregnancy and 4 of 7 studies reported higher mortality rates in pregnant women. LIMITATIONS: No studies were identified in which follow-up began prior to contact with the healthcare system and lack of adjustment for confounding factors. CONCLUSIONS: We found that influenza during pregnancy resulted in a higher risk of hospital admission than influenza infection in non-pregnant individuals, but that the risk of mortality following influenza was similar in both pregnant and non-pregnant individuals.",
