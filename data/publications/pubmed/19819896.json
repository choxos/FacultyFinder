  "title": "Implementing a standardized community-based cardiovascular risk assessment program in 20 Ontario communities.",
  "abstract": "The aim of the study is to describe the implementation of the Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP) in 20 mid-sized communities across Ontario, Canada, and identify key factors in the successful multi-site delivery of a collaborative cardiovascular risk assessment and management program. Lead organizations were identified and contracted following a request for proposals. An Implementation Guide detailed steps in community mobilization and delivery of volunteer-led pharmacy-based cardiovascular risk assessment sessions. Process data were collected through final reports; a debriefing meeting; and interviews with program staff. All 20 communities successfully implemented CHAP. Overall, 99% (338/341) of family physicians agreed to receive assessment results and 89% (129/145) of pharmacies held sessions. Five hundred and seventy-seven volunteers conducted 27,358 risk assessments for 15,889 unique participants. Essential program components were consistently included, however, variations in materials, processes and support occurred. Factors in program success included: local expertise, centralized support, identification and engagement of local physician and pharmacist opinion leaders and a balance of standardization and flexibility. Monitoring delivery of a multi-community cardiovascular risk assessment program yielded key factors in program success to inform development of a sustainable and transferable model.",
