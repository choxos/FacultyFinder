  "title": "Implementation of the virtual transitional care stroke intervention for older adults with stroke and multimorbidity: A qualitative descriptive study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Older adults with stroke and multimorbidity experience frequent care transitions, which are often poorly coordinated and fragmented. We conducted a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the implementation and effectiveness of the Transitional Care Stroke Intervention (TCSI), a 6-month, multi-component, evidence-informed intervention to support older adults with stroke and multimorbidity using outpatient stroke rehabilitation services. The TCSI was designed to support self-management, improve health outcomes, and enhance the quality and experience of care transitions. OBJECTIVE: To explore the facilitators and challenges to implementing the TCSI, from the perspective of healthcare providers (HCPs) (n = 12) and Managers (n = 3). METHODS: Data collection and analysis were guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). Data were collected from study documents, individual and group interviews conducted with HCPs and a Care Coordinator, and surveys from managers. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Intervention implementation was facilitated by: a) strong collaborative and interdependent HCP team relationships, b) dedicated resources (funding, staffing) to support intervention delivery, c) training and ongoing support, customized to individual HCP needs, d) organizational readiness, strong leadership, and effective champions, e) structures to facilitate virtual information-sharing, and f) regular monitoring of intervention implementation. Implementation challenges included: a) COVID-19 related challenges (staff turnover, community service disruptions), b) poor communication with community service providers, c) documentation burden (intervention-related), and d) virtual care delivery. CONCLUSIONS: This research enhances understanding of the diversity of factors influencing implementation of the TCSI, and the conditions under which implementation is more likely to succeed.",
