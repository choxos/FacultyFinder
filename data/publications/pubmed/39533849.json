  "title": "Enhancing Spanish Patient Education Materials: Comparing the Readability of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Spanish Patient Education Materials to the Society of Pediatric Dermatology Spanish Patient Brochures.",
  "abstract": "Patient education materials (PEMs) are crucial for improving patient adherence and outcomes; however, they may not be accessible due to high reading levels. Our study used seven readability measures to compare the readability of Spanish PEMs from the Society of Pediatric Dermatology (SPD) with those generated by Open-AI's ChatGPT 4.0 and Google Gemini. Our results showed that when prompted to produce material at a 6th grade level, both AI ChatBots generated significantly improved readability scores when compared to the SPD handouts. These findings suggest that AI-generated PEMs could better meet readability standards and potentially improve patient outcomes, although further studies are needed to confirm this.",
