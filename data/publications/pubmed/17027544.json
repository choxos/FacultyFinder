  "title": "Midterm results of primary total knee arthroplasty using a dished polyethylene insert with a recessed or resected posterior cruciate ligament.",
  "abstract": "Use of a dished polyethylene insert in 114 total knee arthroplasties, all with the posterior cruciate ligament resected or recessed, was retrospectively studied. Patients were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 8.3 years. Mean range of motion increased from 92 degrees to 111 degrees . Mean Knee Society pain and function scores increased from 35.2 and 39.7 to 91.3 and 74.7, respectively. WOMAC scores improved significantly in each category evaluated, including pain, stiffness, and physical function. Kaplan-Meier survivorship was 95% at 10 years (95% confidence interval, 82%-99%). The use of a dished polyethylene insert in primary total knee arthroplasty provides good to excellent midterm results regardless of whether the posterior cruciate ligament is recessed or sacrificed.",
