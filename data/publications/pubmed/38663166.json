  "title": "Patient factors associated with novel EAR-Q appearance, psychosocial, and social scales: A cross-sectional study and regression analysis.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The EAR-Q is a rigorously validated patient-reported outcome measure, which evaluates ear appearance and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with congenital or acquired ear conditions. The aim of this study was to conduct an exploratory analysis to examine the factors associated with EAR-Q appearance and HRQL scale scores. METHODS: In this study, 862 participants, aged 8-29 years, with congenital or acquired ear conditions, completed the EAR-Q as part of an international field-test study. Patients responded to demographic and clinical questions as well as the EAR-Q. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were used to determine factors that were significant predictors for the scores on the EAR-Q Appearance, Psychological, and Social scales. RESULTS: Most participants were men (57.4%), awaiting treatment (55.0%), and had a microtia diagnosis (70.4%), with a mean age of 13 (±4) years. Worse ear appearance scores (p < 0.02) were associated with male gender, microtia, no history of treatment, ear surgery within 6 months, unilateral involvement, and greater self-reported ear asymmetry. Decreased psychological scores (p < 0.01) were associated with increasing participant age, no treatment history, recent ear surgery, and dissatisfaction with ears matching or overall dissatisfaction. Lower social scores (p ≤ 0.04) were associated with no treatment history, those awaiting surgery, ear surgery within the last 6 months, bilateral involvement, and self-reported ears matching or overall appearance. CONCLUSION: This analysis identified patient factors that may influence ear appearance and HRQL scale scores. These findings provide evidence of patient factors that should be adjusted for when undertaking future observational research designs using the EAR-Q in this patient population.",
