  "title": "Hip Arthroscopy Improves Outcomes With Moderate Conversion to Total Hip Arthroplasty Rates in Patients Aged 50 Years or Older: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to assess the indications, outcomes, and complications of hip arthroscopy in individuals 50 years of age or older over the past 5 years. METHODS: The electronic databases PUBMED, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were searched on March 3, 2022, for studies assessing the use of primary hip arthroscopy for patients aged 50 years or older from the past 5 years. The Methodological Index for Non-randomized Studies (MINORS) was used to assess study quality. Data are presented descriptively. RESULTS: Overall, 17 studies were included, consisting of 6,696 patients (37.5%) with a mean age of 61.4 Â± 5.0 years and a median follow-up of 24 months (range: 1.4-70.1). Indications for hip arthroscopy in patients aged 50 years or older were unspecified/undefined (93.8%), mixed pathology (i.e., combined femoroacetabular impingement [FAI], labral tear, osteoarthritis, etc.) (2.7%), and FAI (2.6%). Eleven studies demonstrated significant improvement in functional outcome scores from baseline to final follow-up. Of the 6 studies that compared outcomes across multiple age groups, 3 demonstrated significantly worse functional outcomes, and 2 demonstrated significantly higher rates of conversion to THA for older patients compared to younger patients. Lastly, the overall complication rates ranged from 0 to 38.3%. The rate of conversion to THA ranged from 0 to 34.6%, occurring between 6 and 60 months postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Hip arthroscopy for patients aged 50 years or older yields significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes postoperatively compared to baseline, with a moderate rate of conversion to THA (range: 0 to 34.6%). Clinicians should consider patient history (e.g., imaging, comorbidities, etc.) and values when electing for hip arthroscopy in the older population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV, systematic review of Level III and IV studies.",
