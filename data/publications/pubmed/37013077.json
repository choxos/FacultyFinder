  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Engaging families in care leads to improved patient- and family-centreed outcomes and is recommended by cardiovascular societies. However, no validated tools are currently available to measure family engagement in acute cardiac care. We previously described the development of the FAMily Engagement (FAME) instrument. The purpose of this study is to validate the FAME instrument in acute cardiac care. METHODS: The FAME questionnaire was administered to family members of patients in a cardiovascular intensive care unit and ward at an academic tertiary care hospital in Montreal, Canada. After hospital discharge, we assessed family satisfaction in the intensive care unit (FS-ICU) and mental health (using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]). Higher FAME scores indicate increased care engagement. Reliability was assessed using internal consistency testing. Predictive validity was evaluated by assessing the relationship between the FAME score and the FS-ICU score and whether the FAME score was correlated with the HADS score. Convergent validity was assessed by comparing the FAME score with engagement elements of the FS-ICU score. RESULTS: A total of 160 family participants were included (age 54.8 ± 14.8 years; 66% women; 36% non-White). The most common relationships to the patient were spouse/partner and adult child (both n = 62; 39%). The mean FAME score was 70.8 ± 16.0. The FAME instrument had high internal consistency (Cronbach's a = 0.86). The FAME score was associated with family satisfaction in the multivariable analysis (P < 0.001). No correlation occurred between FAME and HADS anxiety or depression scores. CONCLUSIONS: The FAME tool demonstrated reliability and convergent and predictive validity in the acute care cardiac population. Further research is needed to explore whether selected engagement interventions can impact the FAME score favourably.",
