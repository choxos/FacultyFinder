  "title": "Third-Grade Academic Performance and Episodes of Cardiac Care Among Children with Congenital Heart Defects.",
  "abstract": "Children with congenital heart defects (CHDs) are at risk for poor academic performance. The degree to which receipt of health care services is associated with adverse academic outcomes is not known. We examined the association between episodes of cardiac care and third-grade performance in children with CHD. We identified subjects between 1/1/2008 and 4/30/2012 among 5 centers in North Carolina. We classified children by CHD type and linked subjects to the state educational records. Any inpatient or outpatient cardiac encounter on a date of service was considered an encounter. We calculated the number of encounters by adding the number of inpatient or outpatient cardiac visits prior to the date of the end-of-grade (EOG) tests. We estimated the odds of failing third-grade reading or math EOG tests by episodes of care stratified at the 50th percentile, controlling for CHD type, maternal education, sex, race/ethnicity, birth weight, and gestational age. A total of 184 children had third-grade EOG scores linked to health care records. The median number of episodes of care was 4 (range: 1-60). Those with visits ˃ 50th percentile (> 4 encounters/year over the 4.3 year observation period) had 2.09 (95% CI 1.04, 4.21) greater odds of failing the math EOG compared to those ≤ 50th percentile (1-4 encounters). The third-grade math score declined by 1.5 points (P < 0.008) for every 10 episodes of care. There was no association of episodes of care on third-grade reading performance. Children with CHD with > 4 episodes of cardiac care/year may be at risk for delays in third-grade academic performance. Strategies to minimize school absenteeism may improve academic success in this population.",
