  "title": "Unidirectional Nanopore Dehydration Induces a Highly Stretchable and Mechanically Robust Silk Fibroin Membrane Dominated by Type II β-Turns.",
  "abstract": "Aqueous silk fibroin solution is dehydrated by evaporation into a water-soluble cast film (SFME) with poor mechanical properties but becomes by unidirectional nanopore dehydration (UND) into silk fibroin membrane (SFMU) with water-stable and good mechanical robustness. The thickness and tensile force of the SFMU are almost twice those of the MeOH-annealed SFME. The UND-based SFMU has a tensile strength of 15.82 MPa, an elongation of 665.23%, and a type II β-turn (Silk I) that accounts for 30.75% of the crystal structure. Mouse L-929 cells adhere, grow, and proliferate well on it. The UND temperature can be used to tune the secondary structure, mechanical properties, and biodegradability. UND induced the oriented arrangement of the silk molecules, which led to the formation of the SFMU dominated with Silk I structure. The silk metamaterial by controllable UND technology has great potential in medical biomaterials, biomimetic materials, sustained drug release, and flexible electronic substrates.",
