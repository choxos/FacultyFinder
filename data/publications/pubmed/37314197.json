  "title": "Association of bone morphogenetic protein 10 and recurrent atrial fibrillation after catheter ablation.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: Atrial remodelling, defined as a change in atrial structure, promotes atrial fibrillation (AF). Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP10) is an atrial-specific biomarker released to blood during atrial development and structural changes. We aimed to validate whether BMP10 is associated with AF recurrence after catheter ablation (CA) in a large cohort of patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured baseline BMP10 plasma concentrations in AF patients who underwent a first elective CA in the prospective Swiss-AF-PVI cohort study. The primary outcome was AF recurrence lasting longer than 30 s during a follow-up of 12 months. We constructed multivariable Cox proportional hazard models to determine the association of BMP10 and AF recurrence. A total of 1112 patients with AF (age 61 ± 10 years, 74% male, 60% paroxysmal AF) was included in our analysis. During 12 months of follow-up, 374 patients (34%) experienced AF recurrence. The probability for AF recurrence increased with increasing BMP10 concentration. In an unadjusted Cox proportional hazard model, a per-unit increase in log-transformed BMP10 was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.28 (95% CI 1.43; 3.62, P < 0.001) for AF recurrence. After multivariable adjustment, the HR of BMP10 for AF recurrence was 1.98 (95% CI 1.14; 3.42, P = 0.01), and there was a linear trend across BMP10 quartiles (P = 0.02 for linear trend). CONCLUSION: The novel atrial-specific biomarker BMP10 was strongly associated with AF recurrence in patients undergoing CA for AF.
