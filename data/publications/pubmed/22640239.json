  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship of cognitive function with glucose tolerance status and obesity in Chinese middle-aged or aged adults. METHODS: A sample of 1722 subjects aged 40 years or order was investigated from four communities in Shijingshan District, Beijing, China. People with any emotional disorder, substance abuse, known diabetes or stroke were excluded. Global cognitive function was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). RESULTS: People with normal glucose tolerance showed higher mean MMSE scores compared to those with pre-diabetes or diabetes (p > 0.05 in males, p < 0.05 in females). People with ideal BMI (18.5-23.9) showed higher mean MMSE scores compared to those with BMI < 18.5 or BMI ≥ 24, but there was no statistical significance (p < 0.05) The significantly lower MMSE scores was shown in the groups with waist circumferences ≥ 85 cm in males, or ≥ 80 cm in females (p < 0.05). The multivariate linear regression analysis showed significant association of MMSE with waist circumferences, SBP, HDL-c and FPG (p=0.000, B=-0.179; p=0.000, B =-0.073; p=0.016, B=0.165; p=0.028, B=-0.124, respectively), except the association with age, education, economic income, smoking and alcohol intake. CONCLUSIONS: In middle aged or aged residents, glucose tolerance status, obesity, and especially central obesity may be the important contributors to cognitive impairment.",
