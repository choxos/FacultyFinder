  "title": "Pain experiences among those living with hidradenitis suppurativa: a qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pain is rated by patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) as the disease's most impactful symptom. HS therapies are often insufficient to control inflammatory disease activity and pain. A better understanding of patient experiences with pain may improve patient-provider relationships and help identify strategies for addressing HS pain. OBJECTIVES: This qualitative study sought to characterize lived pain experiences of those with HS. METHODS: English-speaking patients ≥ 18 years old with a dermatologist-confirmed diagnosis of HS and an average numerical rating scale pain score of ≥ 1 over the preceding week were recruited from a single academic medical centre in Atlanta, Georgia, USA. Semistructured interviews were conducted from November 2019 to March 2020 to explore participants' HS pain experiences and the subsequent impact on their lives. Thematic saturation was reached after interviewing 21 participants. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Among 21 study participants, the median 7-day average pain score was 6 (interquartile range 3-7; scale ranges from 0 to 10, with 10 being most pain). Participants' descriptions of pain were consistent with nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain and itch. Pain impacted multiple life domains, including physical limitations (decreased mobility and impaired sleep), decreased psychological wellbeing (irritability, depression, loss of control, and difficulty communicating pain experiences) and impaired social relationships (social isolation, intimacy problems and difficulty fulfilling social responsibilities). Although participants reported chronic discomfort, acutely painful and unpredictable HS disease flares caused more distress and quality-of-life (QoL) burden. Participants frequently treated their pain without input from the medical team, sometimes with unsafe medication doses or combinations. Factors contributing to self-management of pain included difficulty accessing timely outpatient care during disease flares and fear of stigma from healthcare providers. CONCLUSIONS: When present, HS-related pain may impact not only physical wellbeing but also mental health and relationships. In addition to therapies that target the inflammatory disease burden, treating the symptom of pain may improve patients' QoL and wellbeing. Because patients with HS have difficulty explaining their pain, proactively asking them about pain may identify unmet needs, facilitate better pain control and improve QoL. Further, the influence of HS-related pain on numerous aspects of QoL suggests the need for multidisciplinary, patient-centred approaches to HS pain management.",
