  "title": "Barriers and facilitators to implementation of intravenous cardiovascular treatments in ambulatory settings.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: Intravenous (IV) therapies have transformed the management of various cardiovascular conditions in ambulatory patients. However, uptake of these therapies in ambulatory care settings has several barriers. In this systematic scoping review, we aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators that influence the implementation of current IV therapies in ambulatory settings. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases from inception to September 2023 for studies on barriers and facilitators of IV therapy uptake in ambulatory patients. We classified the identified factors and performed a thematic analysis. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, primarily conducted in North America and Europe, were included. Methodologies varied, precluding quantitative synthesis. Key barriers were identified across several levels. At the medication level, barriers included the need for multiple vials and lengthy preparation. Patient-level barriers included adverse effects, infections, painful venous access and non-adherence. Clinician-level barriers included understaffing, time constraints and safety concerns. Institutional barriers ranged from staff or equipment shortages to liability concerns and complex logistics. Healthcare system barriers included financial constraints and limited care delivery services. Facilitators included evidence-based indications, patient education and comfort, staff experience, guidance documents, safe settings, favourable insurance policies and supportive guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As novel IV treatments emerge, addressing barriers and leveraging facilitators preemptively can enhance the successful implementation of IV therapies and improve clinical outcomes in ambulatory settings.",
