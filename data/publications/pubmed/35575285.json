  "title": "The impact of body mass index (BMI) on satisfaction with work life: An international BODY-Q study.",
  "abstract": "Obesity is a global health issue known to have a major influence on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). HR-QOL is a concept evaluating physical and psychological health. Work life can impact HR-QOL in people with obesity. The aim of this study was to measure the association between body mass index (BMI) and satisfaction with work life. This study included participants from an international multicenter field-test study of BODY-Q scales. Recruitment took place at hospitals in Denmark, The Netherlands and USA between June 2019 and January 2020. The BODY-Q Work Life scale was used to measure work life satisfaction. The difference between BMI groups and work life satisfaction was examined using one-way analysis of variance. Multivariable linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between BMI and work life satisfaction, adjusted for significant confounders. Of 4123 participants, 2515 completed the BODY-Q Work Life scale. BMI groups showed significant difference in work life satisfaction (p < .0001). The Work Life scale mean score was 77.6 for the normal BMI group, 78.5 for the overweight group and 75.0, 68.9 and 63.8 for Class 1, 2 and 3 obesity, respectively. Furthermore, BMI was significantly associated with satisfaction with work life (adjusted regression coefficient -.962, p < .0001). Higher BMI was associated with lower work life satisfaction. This finding suggests that a reduction in BMI may have a positive influence on work life satisfaction in people with obesity.",
