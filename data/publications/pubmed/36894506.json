  "title": "Monitoring Cardiac Biomarkers with Aptamer-Based Molecular Pendulum Sensors.",
  "abstract": "Reagent-free electronic biosensors capable of analyzing disease markers directly in unprocessed body fluids will enable the development of simple & affordable devices for personalized healthcare monitoring. Here we report a powerful and versatile nucleic acid-based reagent-free electronic sensing system. The signal transduction is based on the kinetics of an electrode-tethered molecular pendulum-a rigid double stranded DNA with one of the strands displaying an analyte-binding aptamer and the other featuring a redox probe-that exhibits field-induced transport modulated by receptor occupancy. Using chronoamperometry, which enables the sensor to circumvent the conventional Debye length limitation, the binding of an analyte can be monitored as these species increase the hydrodynamic drag. The sensing platform demonstrates a low femtomolar quantification limit and minimal cross-reactivity in analyzing cardiac biomarkers in whole blood collected from patients with chronic heart failure.",
