  "title": "The impact of climate change on health needs structured evidence assessment and an evidence to action framework to make decisions: a proposal to adopt the GRADE approach.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To highlight how using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) approach to understand the certainty in the evidence about the impact of climate change in health outcomes increases transparency. Also, how GRADE can enhance communication and decisions about adaptation and mitigation strategies. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We developed a narrative review based on an assessment of exiting systematic reviews addressing the effect of climate change on health outcomes and the impact of mitigation and adaptation strategies. RESULTS: Adopting structured approaches such as GRADE to tackle the impact of climate change on health may help to (1) define the specific question to be addressed; (2) summarize the evidence in a structured way and assess uncertainty; (3) provide a systematic framework to move from evidence to action and to offer recommendations of different strength; (4) provide a systematic way to adapt recommendations to specific settings; and (5) provide a framework to assess the certainty of modeled evidence. CONCLUSION: In this article, we describe epidemiologic principles that could be used to move decision-making in climate change forward.",
