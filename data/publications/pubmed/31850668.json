  "abstract": "Children with ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations in ATM, which is critical for repairing DNA defects, are at risk for the development of hematologic malignancy, frequently driven by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Conventional chemotherapy is poorly tolerated by patients with AT, with excessive toxicity even when doses are reduced. Here, we report on two patients with AT and EBV-positive neoplasms who were treated with EBV-targeted viral-specific T cells (VST). One patient had a prolonged complete response to VSTs while the other had a partial response. Therapy was well tolerated without infusion toxicity or graft-versus-host disease.",
