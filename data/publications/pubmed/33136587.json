  "title": "The Complexity of the NICU-to-Home Experience for Adolescent Mothers: Meleis' Transitions Theory Applied.",
  "abstract": "Quality care for individuals and families during periods of transition is one of the major issues facing health care systems and providers today. The transition-home from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) as experienced by adolescent mothers is poorly understood-placing young mothers and their infants at risk of poor outcomes following NICU discharge. Meleis' Transitions Theory offers a unique theoretical perspective for understanding this transition experience and also serves to highlight the complexity of the NICU-to-home transition for this population of young mothers that is not currently elucidated in the literature.",
