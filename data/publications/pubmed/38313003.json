  "abstract": "This study explores the neuroprotective potential of hibiscetin concerning memory deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of hibiscetin against LPS-injected memory deficits in rats. The behavioral paradigms were conducted to access LPS-induced memory deficits. Various biochemical parameters such as acetyl-cholinesterase activity, choline-acetyltransferase, antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, glutathione transferase, catalase), oxidative stress (malonaldehyde), and nitric oxide levels were examined. Furthermore, neuroinflammatory parameters such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, and nuclear factor-kappa B expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor as well as apoptosis marker i.e., caspase-3 were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the hibiscetin-treated group exhibited significant recovery in LPS-induced memory deficits in rats by using behavioral paradigms, biochemical parameters, antioxidant levels, oxidative stress, neuroinflammatory markers, and apoptosis markers. Recent research suggested that hibiscetin may serve as a promising neuroprotective agent in experimental animals and could offer an alternative in LPS-injected memory deficits in rodent models.",
