  "title": "Clinician Perspectives of Communication with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Managing Pain: Needs and Preferences.",
  "abstract": "Poor communication is an important factor contributing to health disparity. This study sought to investigate clinicians' perspectives about communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients with pain. This multi-site and mixed-methods study involved clinicians from three pain management services in Queensland, Australia. Clinicians completed a survey and participated in focus groups. Clinicians rated the importance of communication training, their knowledge, ability, and confidence in communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients using a 5-point Likert scale. Rating scores were combined into low (scores 1-2); moderate (score 3) and high (scores 4-5). Informed by an interpretive description methodology, thematic analysis of focus group data was used to identify the communication needs and training preferences of clinicians. Overall (N = 64), 88% of clinicians rated the importance of communication training when supporting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients as \"high\". In contrast, far fewer clinicians rated as \"high\" their knowledge (28%), ability (25%) and confidence (28%) in effectively communicating with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. Thematic analysis identified three areas of need: knowledge of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, health beliefs, and understanding cross-cultural cues. Communication skills can be learned and training, in the form of a tailored intervention to support quality engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, should combine cultural and communication aspects with biomedical knowledge.",
