  "title": "Isolation and characterization of phytochemicals from ethyl acetate fraction of Solanum nigrum using GC-MS.",
  "abstract": "Solanum nigrum plant has rich therapeutic potential and different developed countries utilize this plant as a chief element for oriental medicinal practice including cancer therapy. The current study determines the isolation and purification of S. nigrum bioactive constituents through column chromatography from ethyl acetate extract of the plant followed by the Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (GC-MS) to analyze the isolated compounds Different gradient elutions followed by thin layer chromatography of collected fractions were done and structural analysis of the isolated compounds was performed following GCMS analysis, More specifically the compounds were identified as 1, 2 benzene dicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester (95%) and as Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (84%) along with 3 hydroxy 4 carboxy 2 methyl 6 pyridine (58%) with reference to chemical abstract service which may be responsible for its pharmacological properties. According to the best information available, no documented information exists regarding GC-MS based identification of the isolated chemical compounds from the S. nigrum. Present findings will help in exploring the therapeutic potential of 1, 2 benzene dicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester (95%), Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (84%) and 3 hydroxy 4 carboxy 2 methyl 6 pyridine (58%) will be helpful in the development of new composites in pharmaceutical fields.",
