  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to develop a scoring function to calculate health utilities for health states described by the Health Utility for Glaucoma (HUG-5) based on the preferences of the general population in the United States. METHODS: Preferences for HUG-5 health states were elicited using the standard gamble and visual analog scale through an online survey. Quota-based sampling was used to recruit a representative sample of the US general population in terms of age, sex, and race. A multiple attribute disutility function (MADUF) approach was adopted to derive scoring for the HUG-5. Model fit was assessed using mean absolute error associated with 5 HUG-5 marker health states that describe mild/moderate and severe glaucoma. RESULTS: Of 634 respondents completing the tasks, 416 were included in the estimation of the MADUF; 260 respondents (63%) considered worst possible HUG-5 health state better than death. The preferred scoring function generates the utilities ranging from 0.05 (worst HUG-5 health state) to 1 (best HUG-5 health state). The correlation between mean elicited and estimated values for marker states was strong (R[2] = 0.97) with mean absolute error = 0.11. CONCLUSIONS: The MADUF for HUG-5 is used to measure health utilities on the scale of perfect health and death, which can be used to estimate quality-adjusted life-years for economic evaluations of glaucoma interventions.",
