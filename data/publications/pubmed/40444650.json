  "title": "An Action Research Approach to Implementing a Program for Sharing Meaningful Moments With Hospitalized Patients Living With Dementia.",
  "abstract": "Meaningful moments are brief, non-pharmacological person-centered interactions or activities that evoke positive emotions in hospitalized patients living with dementia and connect them to their history, identity, or surroundings. The aim of the study was to (a) identify key elements of an innovation primarily designed for long-term care that would be suitable for facilitating meaningful moments for people with dementia in a hospital environment, (b) determine the preferred way of introducing these key elements into practice, and (c) map out determinants, implementation strategies, mechanisms, and outcomes using the Implementation Research Logic Model. Successful implementation required an approach focused on knowing the person, sharing meaningful moments, and incorporating those approaches into everyday care routines. Factors for success included an iterative feedback loop, persuasive education, clear roles, and effective leadership.",
