  "title": "Smartphone App for Prehospital ECG Transmission in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Activation: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis and treatment for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) requires a coordinated response from multiple providers. Rapid intervention is key to reducing mortality and morbidity. Activation of the cardiac catheterization laboratory may occur through verbal communication and may also involve the secure sharing of electrocardiographic images between frontline health care providers and interventional cardiologists. To improve this response, we developed a quick, easy-to-use, privacy-compliant smartphone app, that is SMART AMI-ACS (Strategic Management of Acute Reperfusion and Therapies in Acute Myocardial Infarction Acute Coronary Syndromes), for real-time verbal communication and sharing of electrocardiographic images among health care providers in Ontario, Canada. The app further provides information about diagnosis, management, and risk calculators for patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to integrate the app into workflow processes to improve communication for STEMI activation, resulting in decreased treatment times, improved patient outcomes, and reduced unnecessary catheterization laboratory activation and transfer. METHODS: Implementation of the app will be guided by the Reach, Effectiveness, Acceptability, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to measure impact. The study will use quantitative registry data already being collected through the SMART AMI project (STEMI registry), the use of the SMART AMI app, and quantitative and qualitative survey data from physicians. Survey questions will be based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research. Descriptive quantitative analysis and thematic qualitative analysis of survey results will be conducted. Continuous variables will be described using either mean and SD or median and IQR values at pre- and postintervention periods by the study sites. Categorical variables, such as false activation, will be described as frequencies (percentages). For each outcome, an interrupted time series regression model will be fitted to evaluate the impact of the app. RESULTS: The primary outcomes of this study include the usability, acceptability, and functionality of the app for physicians. This will be measured using electronic surveys to identify barriers and facilitators to app use. Other key outcomes will measure the implementation of the app by reviewing the timing-of-care intervals, false \"avoidable\" catheterization laboratory activation rates, and uptake and use of the app by physicians. Prospective evaluation will be conducted between April 1, 2022, and March 31, 2023. However, for the timing- and accuracy-of-care outcomes, registry data will be compared from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2023. Data analysis is expected to be completed in Fall 2024, with the completion of a paper for publication anticipated by the end of 2024. CONCLUSIONS: Smartphone technology is well integrated into clinical practice and widely accessible. The proposed solution being tested is secure and leverages the accessibility of smartphones. Emergency medicine physicians can use this app to quickly, securely, and accurately transmit information ensuring faster and more appropriate decision-making for STEMI activation.
