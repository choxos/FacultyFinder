  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC) is the most highly recommended patient reported outcome measure for assessing patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries and those undergoing ACL reconstruction (ACLR) surgery. The IKDC was developed as a unidimensional instrument for a variety of knee conditions. Structural validity, which determines how an instrument is scored, has not been definitively confirmed for the IKDC in respondents with ACL injuries, and in fact an alternative two-factor/subscale structure has been proposed in this population. The purpose of this study was to determine the most appropriate structure and scoring system for the IKDC in young active patients following ACL injury. METHODS: In total, 618 young patients deemed at high risk of graft rupture were randomized into the Stability 1 trial. Of the trial participants, 606 patients (98%) completed a baseline IKDC questionnaire used for this analysis. A cross sectional retrospective secondary data analysis of the Stability 1 baseline IKDC data was completed to assess the structural validity of the IKDC using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Factor analyses were used to test model fit of the intended one-factor structure, a two-factor structure, and alternative four-factor and bifactor structures (i.e., a combination of a unidimensional factor with additional specific factors) of the IKDC, in a dataset of young active ACL patients. RESULTS: The simple one-factor and two-factor structures of the IKDC displayed inadequate fit in our dataset of young ACL patients. A bifactor model provided the best fit. This model contains one general factor that is substantially associated with all items, plus four secondary, more specific content factors (symptoms, activity level, activities of daily living, and sport) with generally weaker associations to subsets of items. Although the single-factor model did not provide unambiguous support to unidimensionality of the IKDC based on fit indices, the bifactor model supports unidimensionality of the IKDC when covariance between items with similar linguistic structure, response options, or content are acknowledged. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, findings of a bifactor model with evidence of a reliable general factor well defined by all items lends support to continue interpreting and scoring this instrument as unidimensional. This should be confirmed in other samples. Clinically, based on these findings, the IKDC can be represented by a single score for young active patients with ACL tears. A more nuanced interpretation would also consider secondary factors such as sport and activity level. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The Stability 1 trial for which these data were collected was registered on ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT02018354).",
