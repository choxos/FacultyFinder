  "title": "Late Onset Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Lung Transplant Recipients in the Setting of a Targeted Prophylaxis/Preemptive Antifungal Therapy Strategy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). It is unclear how a targeted prophylaxis/ preemptive antifungal therapy strategy impacts the incidence of IPA beyond the first-year posttransplant. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort of LTRs from January 2010 to December 2014. We included all LTRs who survived beyond the first year and followed them until death or 4 years postoperatively. Incidence of probable/proven IPA and Aspergillus colonization were assessed as per International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) criteria. Patients with risk factors, positive Aspergillus cultures, or galactomannan (GM) received targeted prophylaxis/preemptive therapy within the first-year posttransplant. RESULTS: During the study period, 350 consecutive LTRs underwent 1078 bronchoscopies. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage for GM or Aspergillus cultures was reported for 15% (52/350) of LTRs between 2 and 4 years after transplantation. Among them, the median time to positive Aspergillus culture or GM positivity was 703 days (interquartile range, 529-754 d). The incidence rate of IPA and Aspergillus colonization was 30 of 1000 patient-y, and 63 of 1000 patient-y, respectively. The mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with IPA than without IPA (107/1000 patient-years versus 18/1000 patient-years; P < 0.0001). Rate of first-year colonization and IPA was 33% and 9%, respectively. Among the 201 patients who had a negative bronchoscopy during the first year posttransplant, only 6 (3%) developed IPA during the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: A targeted prophylaxis/preemptive therapy strategy within the first-year posttransplant resulted in 4% incidence of IPA at 4-years after transplantation. However, IPA was associated with higher mortality.",
