  "title": "Floating treatment wetlands as biological buoyant filters for wastewater reclamation.",
  "abstract": "Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an innovative product of ecological engineering that can play a promising role in wastewater treatment. It provides low-cost, eco-friendly, and sustainable solutions for the treatment of wastewater, particularly in regions with economic constraints. Generally, FTWs comprise rooted plants that grow on the surface of water with their roots extending down into the pelagic zone rather than being embedded into the sediments. This drooping structure helps develop (1) a hydraulic flow between the root network and the bottom of the treatment system and (2) a large biologically active surface area for the physical entrapment (filtration) of contaminants, as well as their biochemical transformation and degradation. Furthermore, the rooted network allows proliferation of microorganisms that form biofilms and enhance pollutant degradation while promoting plant growth. The augmentation of bacteria in FTWs has been proven to be the most effective approach for reclamation of wastewater. This article discusses the operational parameters of FTWs for maximal remediation of wastewater and highlights the importance of plant-bacteria partnerships in a typical FTW system for enhanced cleanup of wastewater. We propose that this technology is preferable over other methods that require high energy, costs, and area to install or operate machinery.",
