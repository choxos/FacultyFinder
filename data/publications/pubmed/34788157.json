  "title": "Thoracoscopic Resection of Thoracic Inlet Neuroblastic Tumors in Young Children.",
  "abstract": "Background: Thoracic inlet (TI) tumors are rare, and can be particularly challenging to resect due to proximity to mediastinal vessels and nerves. Traditional resection is typically performed through \"trapdoor\" or sternoclavicular incisions. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of thoracoscopic resection of this group of tumors. Methods: We performed a single-center retrospective chart review for children who presented with TI neuroblastic tumors between 2011 and 2020. Demographics, tumor characteristics, treatment, operative complications, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results: Eight patients were identified. The median age at diagnosis was 13 months (interquartile range [IQR] 6-32) with median tumor size at diagnosis of 4.1 cm (IQR 3.6-4.4). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was given in 50% (4/8) with 38% (3/8) undergoing upfront surgery; 1 patient was observed without chemotherapy or surgery. Ultimately, 6 patients had thoracoscopic resection. For thoracoscopic resections, median intraoperative estimated blood loss was 15 mL (IQR 10-28), median operative room time was 199 minutes (IQR 152-259), and median hospital length of stay was 2 days (IQR 2-3). There were two complications: one recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and one new-onset Horner's syndrome. Complete gross total resection was achieved for all children and there were no recurrences or mortalities with a median follow-up of 3 years. Conclusion: Thoracoscopic resection for TI neuroblastic tumors is feasible with minimal morbidity and can lead to adequate oncological resection.",
