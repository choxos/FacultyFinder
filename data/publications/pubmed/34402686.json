  "abstract": "Meningitis caused by Salmonella typhi is rare and is generally seen in infants. We report a case of a 9-year-old boy with extensively drug-resistant S. typhi meningitis. The patient was diagnosed using a culture sensitivity test and successfully treated with meropenem. Culture sensitivity may be included in routine testing for the diagnosis of S. typhi especially in developing countries due to high burden of disease and emergence of drug resistance.",
