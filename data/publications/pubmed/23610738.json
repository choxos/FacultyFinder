  "abstract": "Purpose: The goal of this study was to identify profiles of young adult (YA)-aged cancer survivors' beliefs about their health and well-being. Survivors' beliefs and their associated psychosocial and demographic characteristics may be clinically useful in survivorship care. Patients and methods: YA survivors of pediatric leukemias (n=51), lymphomas (n=24), and solid tumors (n=44), aged 18-29 years old (N=119), were categorized using cluster analysis based on their responses to the Health Competence Beliefs Inventory, a measure assessing beliefs about their health, satisfaction with healthcare, autonomy, and cognitive competence. Profiles of beliefs generated by cluster analysis were examined using self-report measures of health problems, distress, demographics, and provider-reported health problems and cancer treatment intensity. Results: Three distinct clusters were identified: Adaptive (n=54), Low Autonomy (n=25), and Vulnerable (n=40). Adaptive survivors had positive beliefs, low distress, and minimal health problems. The Low Autonomy survivors were similar to those in the Adaptive cluster except they had low autonomy beliefs and the majority reported living with their parents. The Vulnerable cluster had more negative beliefs, the most medical problems, and the highest levels of distress. Conclusion: Health competence belief profiles identified unique subsets of YA survivors of pediatric cancer that have potentially distinct risk factors. Categorizing survivors by health belief patterns may help healthcare providers treat and educate their patients in ways that are tailored to individual survivors' needs and risks.",
