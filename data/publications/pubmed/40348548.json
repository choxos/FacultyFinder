  "abstract": "This article provides an overview of knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in perioperative cardiac surgery, including concomitant surgical procedures, approaches to the conduct of cardiopulmonary bypass, precision medicine, and patient-important recovery outcomes. In addition, emerging approaches to research conduct are discussed, including the use of new analytical techniques involving artificial intelligence and platform trials.",
