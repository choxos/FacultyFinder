  "title": "High risk injection drug use and uptake of HIV prevention and treatment services among people who inject drugs in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.",
  "abstract": "The use of injection drugs in South Africa is increasing. HIV prevention, treatment and addiction services for people who inject drugs (PWID) in South Africa are not well documented. We conducted a mixed-methods study to understand current drug use practices and access to HIV prevention and treatment services for PWID in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We used respondent-driven sampling to recruit 45 people who reported injecting opiates within the past 6 months from Durban, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We found high rates of practices that increase HIV/viral hepatitis risk including the use of shared needles (43%) and direct blood injections (bluetoothing) (18%). Despite 35% of participants living with HIV, only 40% accessed antiretroviral therapy within the past year, and one accessed PrEP. None of the participants reported ever testing for Hepatitis C.",
