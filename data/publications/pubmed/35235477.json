  "title": "Danish translation and linguistic validation of new body-Q scales measuring expectations, eating behavior, distress, symptoms and work life.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to translate and achieve a linguistical and cultural adaption of the newly developed BODY-Q Obesity Module for use in Danish patients. The BODY-Q Eating Module consists of five new modules aiming to measure expectations of weight-loss, eating behavior, eating-related distress, eating-related symptoms and work life. Translation and linguistic validation were performed using a combination of the recommendations developed by the World Health Organization and the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research. The translation was performed in five steps consisting of a forward translation, backward translation, expert panel meeting, cognitive debriefing and final proofreading. Each step aimed for a conceptual and cultural equal translation that was easily understood by patients. The discrepancies encountered in the forward translation included the use of layperson versus medical terminology, different tense and sentence structure. The harmonized version was then backwards translated which led to no conceptual differences. The expert panel reviewed the instrument in full and found two items needing correction in the instrument. Cognitive debriefing did not lead to any revisions and the instrument was well received by the participant group. Proofreading of the instrument led to few corrections in grammar and punctuation but no conceptual corrections. The translation of the BODY-Q Eating Module led to a conceptual and cultural equal version of the instrument for use in Danish patients. The instrument can be used in clinical care and research to inform advancements in the field of bariatric and body contouring surgery.",
