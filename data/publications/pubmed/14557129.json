  "abstract": "HYPOTHESIS: Occult pretransplantation systemic inflammation will identify patients at risk for poor outcomes after renal transplantation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. Adhesion molecule levels were measured in pretransplantation serum samples from 86 recipients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to assess a possible correlation between serum adhesion molecule level and outcome. SETTING: University referral center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Allograft rejection and survival. RESULTS: Patients with low levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 had less graft rejection (P=.007). Low levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 independently predicted decreased rejection (relative risk, 0.17; P=.01), and high levels of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 independently predicted graft loss (relative risk, 3.83; P=.02). Similar correlations were observed for intercellular adhesion molecule 1. CONCLUSIONS: Decreased pretransplantation adhesion molecule expression correlates with less rejection, and increased levels correlate with graft loss. Assessment of pretransplantation inflammatory status may be useful in optimizing immunosuppression therapy.",
