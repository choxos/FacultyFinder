  "abstract": "Bilateral orbital cellulitis is an uncommon presentation in infants, and its association with rhinosinusitis has been scantily reported in the literature. An infant underwent bilateral uncinectomy and right ethmoidal decompression for bilateral orbital cellulitis with right ethmoidal sinusitis, after a period of non-recovery with conservative treatment. Mixed infection with Escherichia coli and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus was observed. The right eyelid swelling began to resolve; however, the left lower eyelid showed an increase in the fluctuant swelling. Transconjunctival incision and drainage of pus was done in the left eye subsequently. The patient showed marked clinical recovery and is doing well. A multidisciplinary management approach can avert potentially life-threatening sequelae of this condition.",
