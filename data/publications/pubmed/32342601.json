  "title": "Metabolic, cardiovascular, and substance use evaluation of living kidney donor candidates: US practices in 2017.",
  "abstract": "We surveyed US transplant centers to assess practices regarding the evaluation and selection of living kidney donors based on metabolic, cardiovascular, and substance use risk factors. Our companion article describes renal aspects of the evaluation. Response rate was 31%. Compared with 2005, programs have become more accepting of hypertensive candidates: 65% in 2017% vs 41% in 2005 consider candidates with hypertension well controlled with 1 medication. One notable exception is black hypertensive candidates, who are frequently excluded regardless of severity. The most common body mass index (BMI) cutoff remains 35 kg/m[2] , and fewer programs now consider candidates with BMI >40 kg/m[2] . A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test of â‰¥140 mg/dL remains the most common criterion for exclusion of prediabetic candidates. One quarter to one third of programs exclude based on isolated cardiac abnormalities, such as mild aortic stenosis; a similar proportion consider these candidates only if older than 50 years. Cigarette or marijuana smoking are infrequently criteria for exclusion, although 45% and 37% programs, respectively, require cessation 4 weeks prior to surgery. In addition to providing an overview of current practices in living kidney donor evaluation, our study highlights the importance of research evaluating outcomes with various comorbidities to guide practice.",
