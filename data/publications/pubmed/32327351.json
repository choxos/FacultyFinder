  "title": "Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidines as atypical protein kinase C inhibitors to control retinal vascular permeability and cytokine-induced edema.",
  "abstract": "Studies demonstrate that small molecule targeting of atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) may provide an effective means to control vascular permeability, prevent edema, and reduce inflammation providing novel and important alternatives to anti-VEGF therapies for certain blinding eye diseases. Based on a literature tricyclic thieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine lead (1), an ATP-competitive inhibitor of the aPKC iota (ι) and aPKC zeta (ζ) isoforms, we have synthesized a small series of compounds in 1-2 steps from a readily available chloro intermediate. A single pyridine congener was also made using 2D NMR to assign regiochemistry. Within the parent pyrimidine series, a range of potencies was observed against aPKCζ whereas the pyridine congener was inactive. Selected compounds were also tested for their effect toward VEGF-induced permeability in BREC cells. The most potent of these (7l) was further assayed against the aPKCι isoform and showed a favorable selectivity profile against a panel of 31 kinases, including kinases from the AGC superfamily, with a focus on PKC isoforms and kinases previously shown to affect permeability. Further testing of 7l in a luciferase assay in HEK293 cells showed an ability to prevent TNF-α induced NFκB activation while not having any effect on cell survival. Intravitreal administration of 7l to the eye yielded a complete reduction in permeability in a test to determine whether the compound could block VEGF- and TNFα-induced permeability across the retinal vasculature in a rat model. The compound in mice displayed good microsomal stability and in plasma moderate exposure (AUC and Cmax), low clearance, a long half-life and high oral bioavailability. With IV dosing, higher levels were observed in the brain and eye relative to plasma, with highest levels in the eye by either IV or PO dosing. With a slow oral absorption profile, 7l accumulates in the eye to maintain a high concentration after dosing with higher levels than in plasma. Compound 7l may represent a class of aPKC inhibitors for further investigation.",
