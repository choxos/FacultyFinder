  "title": "Lack of an effect of anacetrapib on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy subjects.",
  "abstract": "Anacetrapib is currently being developed for the oral treatment of dyslipidemia. A clinical study was conducted in healthy subjects to assess the potential for an interaction with orally administered digoxin. Anacetrapib was generally well tolerated when co-administered with digoxin in the healthy subjects in this study. The geometric mean ratios (GMR) for (digoxin + anacetrapib/digoxin alone) and 90% confidence intervals (CIs) for digoxin AUC(0-last) and AUC(0-∞) were 1.05 (0.96, 1.15) and 1.07 (0.98, 1.17), respectively, both being contained in the accepted interval of bioequivalence (0.80, 1.25), the primary hypothesis of the study. The GMR (digoxin + anacetrapib /digoxin alone) and 90% CIs for digoxin C(max) were 1.23 (1.14, 1.32). Median T(max) and mean apparent terminal t(½) of digoxin were comparable between the two treatments. The single-dose pharmacokinetics of orally administered digoxin were not meaningfully affected by multiple-dose administration of anacetrapib, indicating that anacetrapib does not meaningfully inhibit P-glycoprotein. Thus, no dosage adjustment for digoxin is necessary when co-administered with anacetrapib.",
