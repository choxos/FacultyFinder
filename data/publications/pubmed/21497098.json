  "title": "The Genesis II in primary total knee replacement: a systematic literature review of clinical outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Since its introduction in 1996, the Genesis II Total Knee System has produced good clinical results in patients undergoing primary total knee replacement. A systematic review of the literature-the first of its kind for this device-was undertaken to collect data on the Genesis II in order to provide a better understanding of its medium- to long-term performance. Of 124 Genesis II-related studies published in the literature, 11 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The included studies had a mean follow-up length of 38.1 months. Data from 1201 knees were available for review. Patients were an average of 70.5 years of age and predominantly female (63%). Findings indicated that the revision rate with this implant is low with up to 11.9 years of follow-up, with 14 revisions in total. The survival rate ranged from 100% at 1 and 2 years to 96.0% at 11.9 years. The mean Knee Society knee score improved 51.0 points from preoperative to postoperative evaluation. In conclusion, the Genesis II exhibited good clinical performance with up to 11 years follow-up, with an encouraging rate of survival and improvement in function. Additional studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to better understand the long-term performance of this implant.",
