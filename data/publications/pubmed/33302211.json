  "title": "Challenging anticoagulation cases: A case of acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with chronic thrombocytopenia.",
  "abstract": "We present a case of acute pulmonary embolism in a patient with myelofibrosis and thrombocytopenia. The patient had a history of portal vein thrombosis and had taken warfarin for the past six years. At the time of his pulmonary embolism diagnosis, his INR was 1.5 and platelet count 58 Ã— 10[9]/L. This article discusses how to balance the risk of thrombosis against the risk of bleeding, and reviews the options for pulmonary embolism treatment including transition to low-molecular-weight heparin, direct oral anticoagulants and/or inferior vena cava filters.",
