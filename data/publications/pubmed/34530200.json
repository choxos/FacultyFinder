  "title": "Screening ovarian cancers with Raman spectroscopy of blood plasma coupled with machine learning data processing.",
  "abstract": "The mortality of ovarian cancer is closely related to its poor rate of early detection. In the search of an efficient diagnosis method, Raman spectroscopy of blood features as a promising technique allowing simple, rapid, minimally-invasive and cost-effective detection of cancers, in particular ovarian cancer. Although Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be effective to detect ovarian cancers with respect to normal controls, a binary classification remains idealized with respect to the real clinical practice. This work considered a population of 95 woman patients initially suspected of an ovarian cancer and finally fixed with a cancer or a cyst. Additionally, 79 normal controls completed the ensemble of samples. Such sample collection proposed us a study case where a ternary classification should be realized with Raman spectroscopy of the collected blood samples coupled with suitable spectroscopic data treatment algorithms. In the medical as well as data points of view, the appearance of the cyst case considerably reduces the distances among the different populations and makes their distinction much more difficult, since the intermediate cyst case can share the specific features of the both cancer and normal cases. After a proper spectrum pretreatment, we first demonstrated the evidence of different behaviors among the Raman spectra of the 3 types of samples. Such difference was further visualized in a high dimensional space, where the data points of the cancer and the normal cases are separately clustered, whereas the data of the cyst case were scattered into the areas respectively occupied by the cancer and normal cases. We finally developed and tested an ensemble of models for a ternary classification with 2 consequent steps of binary classifications, based on machine learning algorithms, allowing identification with sensitivity and specificity of 81.0% and 97.3% for cancer samples, 63.6% and 91.5% for cyst samples, 100% and 90.6% for normal samples.",
