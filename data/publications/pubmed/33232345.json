  "title": "Reliability and validity of the RS14 in orphaned and separated adolescents and youths in western Kenya.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The 14-item Resilience Scale (RS14) is a tool designed to measure psychological resilience. It has been used effectively in diverse populations. However, its applicability is largely unknown for Sub-Saharan adolescent populations and completely unknown for orphaned and separated adolescents and youths (OSAY), a highly vulnerable population for whom resilience may be critical. This study assesses the RS14's psychometric properties for OSAY in Uasin Gishu County, Kenya. METHODS: Survey responses from a representative sample of 1016 OSAY (51.3% female) aged 10-25 (mean = 16; SD = 3.5) living in institutional and home-based environments in Uasin Gishu County were analyzed. The RS14's psychometric properties were assessed by examining internal consistency reliability, confirmatory factor analyses, and convergent validity using correlations between resilience and each of social support and depression. Sub-analyses were conducted by age and sex. RESULTS: Resilience scores ranged from 14-98 (mean = 66; SD = 19) with no sex-based significant difference. Resilience was higher for those aged ≥18 (mean = 69; range = 14-98) versus age <18 (mean = 65; range = 14-98). Internal consistency was good (Cronbach's α = .90). Confirmatory factor analysis indicated a 1-factor solution, though the model fit was only moderate. Resilience was positively correlated with social support in all ages (.22; p < .001) and negatively correlated with depression in individuals age <18 (-.22; p < .001). The relationship between resilience and depression in individuals age ≥18 was statistically significant only in females (-.17; p = .026). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates reasonable evidence that the RS14 is both valid and reliable for measuring psychological resilience in the population of OSAY in western Kenya.",
