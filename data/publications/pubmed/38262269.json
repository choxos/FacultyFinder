  "title": "Unraveling the impact of miR-21 on apoptosis regulation in glioblastoma.",
  "abstract": "Glioblastoma is a prevalent form of carcinoma that exhibits a greater incidence rate across diverse demographics globally. Despite extensive global efforts, GBM continues to be a highly lethal disease that is characterized by a grim prognosis. There is a wealth of evidence suggesting that the pathophysiology of GBM is associated with the dysregulation of numerous cellular and molecular processes. The etiology of GBM may involve various cellular and molecular pathways, including EGFR, PDCD4, NF-ÎºB, MAPK, matrix metalloproteinases, STAT, and Akt. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNA molecules, regulate gene expression and mRNA translation after transcription but before translation to exert control over a wide range of biological functions. Extensive research has consistently demonstrated the upregulation of miRNA-21 in glioma, indicating its involvement in diverse biological pathways that facilitate tumor cell survival. By explaining the intricate interplay between miR-21 and the regulation of apoptosis in GBM, this review has the potential to significantly enhance our comprehension of the illness and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",
