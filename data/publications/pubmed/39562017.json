  "title": "Extension of the PRISMA 2020 statement for living systematic reviews (PRISMA-LSR): checklist and explanation.",
  "abstract": "Publications of living systematic reviews (LSRs) are increasing rapidly. Guidance facilitating transparent, complete, and accurate reporting of LSRs is needed. This paper reports the development of an extension of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 statement for LSRs (PRISMA-LSR). The PRISMA-LSR extension includes the PRISMA-LSR checklist, the PRISMA-LSR flow diagram, reporting recommendations for the LSR status, and an explanation and elaboration document. This extension has been developed as an “add-on” to the PRISMA 2020 statement, meaning it should be used in addition to the PRISMA 2020 statement. The PRISMA-LSR extension is expected to benefit authors, editors, peer reviewers, and users of LSRs through transparent, complete, and accurate reporting of LSRs.",
