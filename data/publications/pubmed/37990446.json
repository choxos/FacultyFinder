  "abstract": "AIMS: To validate the diagnostic performance of Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) ultrasound for preoperative adnexal lesions in an external center. The secondary aim was to evaluate the performance of a strategy test including O-RADS ultrasound evaluation and subjective assessment of higher malignant risk lesions. METHODS: One hundred thirty patients with 158 ovarian-adnexal lesions were enrolled in the study. Each lesion was assigned an O-RADS score after real-time ultrasound examination by one experienced radiologist. A second subjective assessment by an expert was performed for O-RADS 4 and O-RADS 5 lesions. The histopathological diagnosis was used as the reference standard. RESULTS: A total of 126 benign and 32 malignant adnexal masses were included in the study. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of O-RADS ultrasound was 0.950, with a cutoff value > O-RADS 3. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values were 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.867-1), 83.3% (95% CI, 0.754-0.892), 60.4% (95% CI, 0.460-0.732), and 100% (95% CI, 0.956-1), respectively. For the strategy test, the sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values were 100% (95% CI, 0.867-1), 92.1% (95% CI, 0.855-0.959), 76.2% (95% CI, 0.602-0.874), and 100% (95% CI, 0.960-1), respectively. In comparison with O-RADS ultrasound, the specificity and negative predictive value of the strategy test were slightly higher (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Good diagnostic performance of the O-RADS ultrasound in adnexal lesions can be achieved by experienced radiologists in clinical practice. A second subjective assessment of sonographic findings can be applied to O-RADS 4 and 5 lesions.",
