  "title": "Treatment satisfaction with sildenafil in a Canadian real-life setting. A 6-month prospective observational study of primary care practices.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While the efficacy of sildenafil for the management of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been demonstrated in randomized clinical trials, few data exist on its effectiveness in a real-life setting. AIM: The objective of this study was to examine the treatment satisfaction and effectiveness with sildenafil in a real-life setting in Canada. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective study, using an educational program aimed at optimizing sildenafil treatment, was conducted at 231 primary care sites across Canada. Patients who received their first prescription of sildenafil for ED within the usual practice of medicine were invited to participate in the study. Data were collected through patient self-administered questionnaires. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) questionnaire was used to determine the erectile function at baseline, month 3 and month 6. Treatment satisfaction at months 3 and 6 was assessed using the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire. RESULTS: The intent-to-treat population consisted of 2,573 patients. The mean age was 55 years (18 to 92 years). At baseline, the mean SHIM score was 11.9 with 21.7% of men having severe ED, 22.9% moderate ED, 36.5% mild-to-moderate ED, and 16.9% mild ED. At month 3, the mean SHIM score improved significantly to 18.0 (P < 0.0001) and 33.3% of patients had a SHIM score above 21 (no ED). At 6 months, the mean SHIM score was 18.7. At both months 3 and 6, approximately 89% of patients were satisfied with their treatment (i.e., EDITS score >or= 50), suggesting no attenuation of the satisfaction over the 6 months of use. CONCLUSIONS: The effectiveness of sildenafil in the management of ED was demonstrated in a large cohort of men treated in a primary care setting in this Canadian real-life study. Persistence with therapy and lack of attenuation over time among the vast majority of men was shown.",
