  "abstract": "The accumulation of carotenoids, such as xanthophylls, lycopene, and carotenes, is responsible for the color of carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus) fleshy roots. The potential role of DcLCYE, encoding a lycopene ε-cyclase associated with carrot root color, was investigated using cultivars with orange and red roots. The expression of DcLCYE in red carrot varieties was significantly lower than that in orange carrots at the mature stage. Furthermore, red carrots accumulated larger amounts of lycopene and lower levels of α-carotene. Sequence comparison and prokaryotic expression analysis revealed that amino acid differences in red carrots did not affect the cyclization function of DcLCYE. Analysis of the catalytic activity of DcLCYE revealed that it mainly formed ε-carotene, while a side activity on α-carotene and γ-carotene was also observed. Comparative analysis of the promoter region sequences indicated that differences in the promoter region may affect the transcription of DcLCYE. DcLCYE was overexpressed in the red carrot 'Benhongjinshi' under the control of the CaMV35S promoter. Lycopene in transgenic carrot roots was cyclized, resulting in the accumulation of higher levels of α-carotene and xanthophylls, while the β-carotene content was significantly decreased. The expression levels of other genes in the carotenoid pathway were simultaneously upregulated. Knockout of DcLCYE in the orange carrot 'Kurodagosun' by CRISPR/Cas9 technology resulted in a decrease in the α-carotene and xanthophyll contents. The relative expression levels of DcPSY1, DcPSY2, and DcCHXE were sharply increased in DcLCYE knockout mutants. The results of this study provide insights into the function of DcLCYE in carrots, which could serve as a basis for creating colorful carrot germplasms.",
