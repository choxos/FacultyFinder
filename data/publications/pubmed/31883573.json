  "title": "How to Design a Qualitative Health Research Study. Part 2: Data Generation and Analysis Considerations.",
  "abstract": "In the first part of this article, we introduced methodological issues associated with study design, research questions, contexts, sampling, and recruiting for qualitative health research studies. Here, in this second part of the article, we continue providing health researchers with information on how to design a qualitative health research study and we aim to prepare novice researchers for entering the field. Specifically, by providing considerations for selecting data gathering strategies, differentiation of types of qualitative data and practical tips on how to go into the field. Then, we will briefly discuss data management, analysis and dissemination.",
