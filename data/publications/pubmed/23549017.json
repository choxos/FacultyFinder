  "abstract": "We report a rare case of a 34-year-old man with a right axillary mass. Ten years previously, he had been diagnosed with a right scapular nonseminomatous germ-cell tumor consisting of teratoma, completely resected without any further treatment. Presently he was found to have a metastatic malignant small round cell tumor consistent with a secondary somatic malignancy arising in the background of nonseminomatous germ-cell tumor, teratoma, yolk sac tumor, and primitive neuroectodermal tumor with distinct chromosome 22 translocation. Although the patient initially responded well to chemotherapy with etoposide, cisplatin, ifosfamide and mesna, he relapsed shortly after.",
