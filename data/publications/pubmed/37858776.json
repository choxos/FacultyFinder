  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe international variation in ethics and contract processes, identify predictors of approval times, and reasons for nonparticipation in an international observational study of ventilation discontinuation practices. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A nested cross-sectional survey of research personnel at 111 participating sites (representing 142 intensive care units [ICUs]) from six geographic regions (Canada, India, the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia/New Zealand, and the United States). RESULTS: We analyzed responses from 80 sites (72.1% response rate). A single local or central approval was required at 34/80 (42.5%) and 23/80 (28.75%), respectively. Of those requiring central ethics approval, 20/23 (87.0%) sites required an additional approval. Sites with central vs. other ethics approval processes had significantly longer times to ethics approval (176 vs. 42 days; P < 0.0001). The median time to contract execution was 140 days (range: 11-1,215) with sites in India and the United States having the shortest and longest times to contract execution, respectively. We did not identify independent predictors of approval times. Of 190 sites that initially agreed to participate, 78 (41%) sites (89 ICUs) were ultimately unable to participate. CONCLUSION: International ethics and contract approval times were lengthy and highly variable. Central ethics review processes significantly increased approval times.",
