  "title": "Conceptual framework for health-related quality of life assessment in acute gastroenteritis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To date, most trials in pediatric acute gastroenteritis have evaluated short-term clinical disease activity (eg, duration of diarrhea or vomiting, level of dehydration), laboratory outcomes (eg, rotavirus, norovirus), or a composite of these outcomes. Measuring health-related quality of life may also be important in evaluating the effect of interventions for acute gastroenteritis in children. The objectives of this study were to conduct individual interviews and, when possible, focus group discussions, with parents of children with acute gastroenteritis; to determine how parent and child quality of life is negatively affected by acute gastroenteritis; and, from the perspective of parents and children, to develop a conceptual framework for quality of life instrument specific to pediatric acute gastroenteritis. METHODS: We conducted interviews and focus groups with parents of children (3 months-5 years of age) given a diagnosis of gastroenteritis in a hospital emergency department. Interviews and focus groups were conducted to determine the effect of gastroenteritis on quality of life in parents and children (as perceived by the parents). RESULTS: Interviews and focus groups involving 25 parents suggested a conceptual framework that, for children, includes 2 domains (physical and emotional function) and 14 subdomains. For parents, our framework includes 3 domains (physical, emotional, and social function) with physical function including 4 subdomains, emotional function including 7 subdomains, and social function including 2 subdomains. The framework has been used to develop a preliminary quality of life questionnaire for parents and children. CONCLUSIONS: Acute gastroenteritis has an important adverse effect on health-related quality in both children and parents involving physical symptoms and restrictions in physical function and disturbed emotional function. Upon further research on the psychometric properties of the proposed questionnaires, future trials of effectiveness should consider measuring patient important outcomes such as health-related quality of life.",
