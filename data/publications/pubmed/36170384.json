  "abstract": "Objective: The development and evaluation of the Professor Hippo-on-Campus Student Mental Health Education Program, a mental health literacy intervention for post-secondary faculty and staff, is described. It includes 3-hour virtual, asynchronous e-modules and an optional 2-hour, synchronous workshop. Participants: All faculty and staff in a single university were invited to participate (February 2020-January 2021). Methods: Pre-and post-module and post-workshop surveys were conducted, assessing knowledge, attitudes, stigma, behavioral intentions, and confidence. Paired t-tests and regressions assessed change. Satisfaction was assessed through closed and open-ended questions, analyzed descriptively and through qualitative content analysis. Results: Four hundred and fifty staff and faculty completed the pre-survey, 262 completed the post-survey, and 122 completed a workshop survey. Participation resulted in improvements in knowledge, attitudes, stigma, and confidence with high levels of satisfaction. Conclusion: The program provides tailored student mental health training to post-secondary staff and faculty, which appears to increase their mental health literacy.",
