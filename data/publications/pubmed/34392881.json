  "title": "Intraoperative Nociception Monitoring.",
  "abstract": "Nociception refers to the process of encoding and processing noxious stimuli. Its monitoring can have potential benefits. Under anesthesia, nociceptive signals are continuously generated to cause involuntary effects on the autonomic nervous system, reflex movement, and stress response. Most available systems depend on the identification and measurement of these indirect effects to indicate nociception-antinociception balance. Despite advances in monitoring technology and availability, their limitations presently override their benefits. Hence, their utility and applicability in present-day anesthesia care is uncertain. Future technologies might allow automated closed-loop multimodal anesthesia systems, which includes the components of hypnosis and analgesic balance for a patient.",
