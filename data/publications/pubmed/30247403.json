  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Traditionally, the orthopaedic trauma literature has been dominated by small studies that were largely single-center initiatives. More recently, there has been a paradigm shift toward larger, multicenter studies because the orthopaedic community embraced the concepts of evidence-based medicine and the need for high-quality research to guide clinical practice. The International Orthopaedic Multicenter Study in Fracture Care is a large multicenter international cohort study in musculoskeletal trauma in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. This is the first study of this magnitude within the global orthopaedic trauma community. The International Orthopaedic Multicenter Study in Fracture Care study has provided an opportunity to form new international collaborative relationships and to develop new research capacity and global collaborative relationships that will provide the foundation for future studies in injury prevention and management.
