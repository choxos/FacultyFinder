  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric cancer diagnosis and treatment can have detrimental mental health effects on parents (caregivers) and their children/adolescents (youth). Psychosocial screening and intervention have been recognized as standards of care in pediatric oncology. The most effective psychosocial interventions to support those in need post screening have not been determined. AIMS: This qualitative study aimed to investigate the perceived benefits and challenges for caregiver and youth participants in the screening-intervention arm of an Enhanced Psychosocial Screening Intervention (EPSI) pilot study. METHODS: EPSI consists of a psychosocial navigator (PSN) who shares screening results conducted near diagnosis (T1) and monthly for 1Â year (T2) with treating teams and families. All 17 caregiver-youth dyads who had completed EPSI were invited to participate in a semi-structured interview. RESULTS: Ten caregivers and nine youth participated. Identified themes were grouped into benefits and challenges of EPSI: feeling supported and cared for (support comes to us regularly, having someone to talk to); and feeling empowered through knowledge of resources and services were perceived as benefits. Caregivers were challenged by feeling overwhelmed, and youth by screening questions perceived as too repetitive. CONCLUSIONS: Regular monthly contacts for a year by the PSN with screening results and recommendations were perceived as beneficial by youth newly diagnosed with cancer and their caregivers who participated in EPSI. Feeling that support came to them and they had someone to talk to was a critical component. While information about psychosocial resources was not always used right away, it did evoke feelings of being empowered.",
