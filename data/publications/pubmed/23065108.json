  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Compare the content, future orientation, and appraisals of self-identified goals of adolescents with cancer and control subjects. Identify correlates of health-related and future-oriented goals of adolescents with cancer. METHODS: Adolescents with cancer (n = 102) and control subjects (n = 97) self-identified goals, rated appraisals of goals, and completed psychosocial measures. RESULTS: Adolescents with cancer identified fewer goals, were more likely to identify a health-related goal, less likely to identify an intrapersonal or leisure goal, and rated their goals as more achievable and supported compared with control subjects. For adolescents with cancer, female gender predicted having a health-related goal. Additionally, age and parent-reported adolescent quality of life predicted having a future-oriented goal. 63 percent of adolescents with cancer reported establishing at least one goal because of cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Despite similarities between groups, evidence supports that adolescents with cancer made changes to their repertoire of goals, suggesting the need to balance various priorities.",
