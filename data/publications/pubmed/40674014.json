  "title": "Suicidality in men following relationship breakdown: A systematic review and meta-analysis of global data.",
  "abstract": "Factors underlying the association between intimate relationship breakdown and men's suicidality are poorly understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined which men are most vulnerable and the factors underpinning men's suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and death by suicide following relationship breakdown. We reviewed 75 studies across 30 countries (N ≥ 100 million men). Of these, 29 studies were included in random-effects meta-analyses and the remainder were narratively synthesized. Meta-analyses found separated/divorced men had greater odds of suicidal ideation than married men (k = 7; odds ratio [OR] = 1.64, 95% CI [1.27, 2.13]). Divorced men also had greater odds of suicide attempt (k = 3; OR = 1.73, 95% CI [1.05, 2.85]) and death by suicide (k = 33; OR = 2.82, 95% CI [2.53, 3.15]) than married men. Risk of suicidality appeared greatest in the immediate aftermath of relationship breakdown, as separated men displayed nearly twofold greater odds of suicide than divorced men (k = 10; OR = 1.96, 95% CI [1.42, 2.71]). Men's suicidality following relationship breakdown was also linked to younger age (≤34 years), less than tertiary education, lack of employment, and psychological factors such as loneliness and emotion dysregulation. Study limitations included the following: wide methodological variability in the source literature, precluding meta-analysis of most included studies; inconsistent reporting of demographics prohibiting more detailed meta-analyses within subgroups of men; and a predominant focus on marital separation and divorce, with comparatively little data reflecting nonmarital relationship breakdown in association with suicidality. Opportunities for preventing suicidality following relationship breakdown are discussed, alongside future research to address knowledge gaps regarding factors that interact with relationship breakdown in men's suicidality.
