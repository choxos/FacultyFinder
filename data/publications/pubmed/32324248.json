  "title": "Surgical Management of Glenohumeral Osteoarthritis With Glenoid Erosion and Static Posterior Subluxation (Walch B2): Techniques, Outcomes, and Survivorship Rates.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to systematically assess the surgical techniques and outcomes related to the management of Walch B2 glenoids. PubMed, Medline, and Embase were searched from inception to July 2018. Overall, 24 studies (787 B2 glenoids) were identified. Revision-free survivorship was highest for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (98.6%) and anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty with asymmetric reaming and a non-augmented glenoid implant (95.6%). Walch B2 glenoids are most commonly managed by asymmetric reaming in the context of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty, and by the ream-and-run technique in hemiarthroplasty. The optimal treatment strategy remains elusive due to a lack of high-quality, comparative studies with long-term surveillance. [Orthopedics. 2020;43(4):e191-e201.].",
