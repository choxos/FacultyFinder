  "abstract": "This article provides an overview of knowledge gaps that need to be addressed in cardiac anesthesia, including mitigating the inflammatory effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, defining myocardial infarction after cardiac surgery, improving perioperative neurologic outcomes, and the optimal management of patients undergoing valve replacement. In addition, emerging approaches to research conduct are discussed, including the use of new analytical techniques like machine learning, pragmatic trials, and adaptive designs.",
