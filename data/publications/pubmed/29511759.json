  "title": "The evolution of size, shape, and surface morphology of gold nanorods.",
  "abstract": "We investigate the transformation of single crystal gold nanorod surface morphology over extended growth times. After initial rapid anisotropic growth and disappearance of {111} bridging facets, the aspect ratios converge across AgNO3 concentrations. The surface morphology transitions from faceted to curved. These observations imply the final aspect ratio has little dependence on the AgNO3 concentration, consistent with primary control of the AgNO3 over aspect ratio occurring at the symmetry breaking point.",
