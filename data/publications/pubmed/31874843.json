  "title": "Gastric necrosis in a term infant treated with near-total gastrectomy and delayed reconstruction with a Hunt-Lawrence pouch.",
  "abstract": "The creation of an intestinal pouch following total gastrectomy is exceedingly rare in infants. We present the case of a term infant who underwent a near-total gastrectomy on day 2 of life for diffuse gastric necrosis with perforation due to severe hypoxemia from an intrapartum nuchal cord. Gastrointestinal continuity was restored at 5 months of age with a Hunt-Lawrence pouch. The child is now 3 years old and has achieved a weight in the 47th percentile despite challenges with micronutrient deficiencies, reduced caloric intake and renal insufficiency requiring 8 months of intermittent haemodialysis.",
