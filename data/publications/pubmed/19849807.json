  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To determine the safety and efficacy of a novel steroid minimization protocol after renal transplantation at a single Northern California center. INTRODUCTION: We have previously reported our experience on the short-term outcomes in eight children using our steroid minimization protocol. Herein, we present our ongoing experience in using this regimen in 20 children. METHODS: Children receiving immunosuppression with a steroid minimization protocol at our center from 1/04-12/08 (Group 2) were retrospectively compared with 20 controls (Group 1). RESULTS: At one-month follow-up, Group 2 was observed to have lower eGFR, hemoglobin, white cell count, and cholesterol. The incidence of adverse events during the first yr was comparable. Three patients in Group 1 displayed histological evidence of acute rejection, one patient in Group 2 developed humoral rejection; another patient in Group 2 had sub-clinical rejection. Surgical complications were observed in 20% of patients in both groups. While 10% of patients in Group 1 developed diabetes mellitus, none was observed in Group 2. Thirty and 40% of patients in Groups 1 and 2, respectively, suffered from infectious complications during the first yr. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel steroid minimization immunosuppression is safe in children and associated with no increased risk of rejection and infection.",
