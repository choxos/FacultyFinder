  "title": "Complete genome sequence analysis of candidate human rotavirus vaccine strains RV3 and 116E.",
  "abstract": "Rotaviruses (RVs) cause severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children; yet, several strains have been isolated from newborns showing no signs of clinical illness. Two of these neonatal strains, RV3 (G3P[6]) and 116E (G9P[11]), are currently being developed as live-attenuated vaccines. In this study, we sequenced the eleven-segmented double-stranded RNA genomes of cell culture-adapted RV3 and 116E and compared their genes and protein products to those of other RVs. Using amino acid alignments and structural predictions, we identified residues of RV3 or 116E that may contribute to attenuation or influence vaccine efficacy. We also discovered residues of the VP4 attachment protein that correlate with the capacity of some P[6] strains, including RV3, to infect newborns versus older infants. The results of this study enhance our understanding of the molecular determinants of RV3 and 116E attenuation and are expected to aid in the ongoing development of these vaccine candidates.",
