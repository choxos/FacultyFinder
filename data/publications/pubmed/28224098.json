  "abstract": "AIM: To determine the feasibility of introducing video recording (VR) of neonatal resuscitation (NR) in a perinatal centre. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort quality improvement study on preterm infants and their caregivers. Based on evidence and experience of other centers using VR intervention, a contextually relevant implementation and evaluation strategy was designed in the planning phase. The components of intervention were pre-resuscitation team huddle, VR of NR and video debriefing (VD), all occurring on the same day. Various domains of feasibility and sustainability as well as feasibility criteria were predefined. Data for analysis was collected using quantitative and qualitative methods. RESULTS: Seventy-one caregivers participated in VD of 14 NRs facilitated by six trained instructors. Ninety-one percent of caregivers perceived enhanced learning and patient safety and, 48 issues were identified related to policy, caregiver roles, and latent safety threats. Ninety percent of caregivers expressed their willingness to participate in VD activity and supported the idea of integrating it into a resuscitation team routine. Eighty-three percent and 50% of instructors expressed satisfaction with video review software and quality of audio VR. No issues about maintenance of infant or caregivers' confidentiality and erasure of videos were reported. Criteria for feasibility were met (refusal rate of < 10%, VR performed on > 50% of occasions, and < 20% caregivers' perceiving a negative impact on team performance). Necessary adaptations to enhance sustainability were identified. CONCLUSION: VR of NR as a standard of care quality assurance activity to enhance caregivers' learning and create opportunities that improve patient safety is feasible. Despite its complexity with inherent challenges in implementation, the intervention was acceptable, implementable, and potentially sustainable with adaptations.",
