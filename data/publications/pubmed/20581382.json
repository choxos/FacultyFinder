  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Trauma data collection by UK hospitals is non-mandatory and data regarding trauma mortality are deficient. Our aim was to provide a contemporary description of mortality in a maturing trauma-receiving hospital serving an inner-city population. METHODS: A prospectively maintained registry was analysed for demographics; injury mechanism; and time, location and cause of death in trauma patients admitted via the Emergency Department between 2004 and 2008. RESULTS: 4986 trauma team activations yielded 4243 complete cases. The number of patients rose from 784 in 2004-2005 to 1400 in 2007/8. 302 (7%) of these died. All-cause mortality fell from 8.8% to 5.8% (p=0.0075). Blunt trauma (predominantly falls from height and road traffic collisions) accounted for 79% of admissions but 87% of mortality. Penetrating trauma accounted for 21% of admissions and 13% of mortality. Most penetrating injury deaths were from stabbing injury (31/40) as opposed to gunshot wounds (8/40). The biggest cause of death was central nervous system injury (47.7%) followed by haemorrhage (26.2%). Penetrating injury death was associated with marked shock and acidosis compared to blunt mechanisms--mean (SD) admission systolic blood pressure 25.4 (45.7) versus 105.5 (60.5) mm Hg; mean (SD) base excess -21.84 (7.2) versus 9.71 (8.45) mmol, respectively. No classical trimodal distribution of death was observed. CONCLUSION: Despite current focus on death from knife and gun crime, the vast majority of trauma mortality arises from blunt aetiology. Maturation of our systems of care has been associated with a drop in mortality as institutional trauma volumes increase and clinical infrastructure develops.",
