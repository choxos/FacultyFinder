  "title": "Association of Primary Versus Rotating Nephrologist Model of Care in Hemodialysis Programs with Patient Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Nephrologist staffing models for patients receiving hemodialysis vary widely. Patients may be cared for continuously by a single primary nephrologist or by a group of nephrologists on a rotating basis. It remains unclear whether these differing care models influence clinical outcomes. In this population-based cohort study of more than 14,000 incident patients on maintenance hemodialysis from Ontario, Canada, we found no difference in mortality, kidney transplantation, home dialysis initiation, hospitalizations, or emergency department visits when care was provided by a single primary nephrologist or a rotating group of nephrologists. These results suggest that primary nephrologist models do not necessarily improve objective clinical outcomes, providing reassurance to patients, providers, and administrators that both models are acceptable options.",
