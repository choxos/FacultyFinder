  "abstract": "The present investigation was committed to examining the effect of soil spiked with diesel contamination (0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 g diesel kg[-1] soil) on maize (Zea mays L) varieties (MMRI yellow and Pearl white) with or without bacterial consortium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa BRRI54, Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56, Acinetobacter sp. strain ACRH80). Seed and soil bacterial inoculation were done. The studied morphological attributes were fresh and dry weight of shoot and root of both maize varieties. The results documented that bacterial consortium caused 21%, 0.06% and 29%, 34% higher shoot and root fresh/dry weights in \"Pearl white\" and 14%, 15% and 32%, 22% shoot and root fresh/dry weights respectively in MMRI yellow under control conditions. The biochemical attributes of shoot and root were affected negatively by the 3.5 g diesel kg[-1] soil contamination. Bacterial consortium enhanced enzymatic activity (APX, CAT, POD, SOD, GR) and non-enzymatic (AsA, GSH, Pro, Î±-Toco) antioxidant and reduction in oxidative stress (H2O2, MDA) under hydrocarbon stress as compared to non-inoculated ones in both root and shoot organs. Among both varieties, the highest hydrocarbon removal (75, 64, and 69%) was demonstrated by MMRI yellow with bacterial consortium as compare to Pearl white showed 73, 57, 65% hydrocarbon degradation at 1.5 2.5, 3.5 g diesel kg[-1] soil contamination. Consequently, the microbe mediated biotransformation of hydrocarbons suggested that the use of PGPB would be the most beneficial selection in diesel fuel contaminated soil to overcome the abiotic stress in plants and successfully remediation of hydrocarbon in contaminated soil.",
