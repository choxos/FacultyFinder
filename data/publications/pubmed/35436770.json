  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To describe the characteristics of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RDs) that developed after endophthalmitis and to provide insight regarding incidence, management, and outcomes. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of consecutive patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis at two Canadian institutions and from one surgeon at a third center over a 10-year period. RESULTS: Three hundred sixteen eyes presented with endophthalmitis of which 32 (10%) were complicated by subsequent RD. The mean age (SD) of patients was 72.0 (13.77) years. Intravitreal injections (33%) and cataract surgery (31%) were the most common inciting events for the endophthalmitis. Cases were managed with tap and inject (16%), vitrectomy (30%), or both (47%). There were no differences in the rate of RD when comparing the inciting events, microbial growth, or management approaches. Baseline visual acuity was the only predictor of RD (P = 0.009). There was an improvement in visual acuity following management of the RD (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 2.33 vs. 1.69 or Snellen hand motion vs. 20/980, P = 0.009), but final visual acuity in these patients was worse than in those who did not develop RD (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution 1.69 vs. 1.27 or Snellen 20/980 vs. 20/372, P = 0.029). CONCLUSION: All patients with RD post endophthalmitis required additional surgery, and functional outcomes remained poor. Nevertheless, repair of these RDs can preserve some vision and be globe saving.",
