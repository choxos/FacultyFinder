  "title": "Pediatric cutaneous T-cell post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder: Case report and review of the literature.",
  "abstract": "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare lymphoid and/or plasmacytic proliferation that occurs in the context of immunosuppression because of solid organ transplantation (SOT) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PTLD is the most common cancer in children who receive a SOT or HSCT, occurring in up to 13% of these patients. The majority of PTLDs are extracutaneous B-cell lymphomas, with only 12% to 14%, representing the T-cell phenotype. PTLDs can involve the skin and behave like an aggressive lymphoma, and are among the most serious and potentially fatal complications of transplantation. Here we present a case report and review of the literature of pediatric cutaneous PTLD.",
