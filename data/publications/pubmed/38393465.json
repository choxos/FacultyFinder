  "title": "The role of CXCL1 in crosstalk between endocrine resistant breast cancer and fibroblast.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: ER positive breast cancer is currently targeted using various endocrine therapies. Despite the proven therapeutic efficacy, resistance to the drug and reoccurrence of tumor appears to be a complication that many patients deal with. Molecular pathways underlying the development of resistance are being widely studied. METHODS AND RESULTS: In this study, using four established endocrine resistant breast cancer (ERBC) cell lines, we characterized CXCL1 as a secreted factor in crosstalk between ERBC cells and fibroblasts. Protein array revealed upregulation of CXCL1 and we confirmed the CXCL1 expression by real-time qRT-PCR and U-Plex assay. Co-culturing ERBC cells with fibroblasts enhanced the cell growth and migration compared to monoculture. The crosstalk of ERBC cells with fibroblasts significantly activates ERK/MAPK signaling pathway while reparixin, CXCR1/2 receptor inhibitor, attenuates the activity. Reparixin displayed the ERBC cell growth inhibition and the combination treatment with reparixin and CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib and ribociclib) increased these inhibitory effect. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study implicates CXCL1 as a critical role in ERBC growth and metastasis via crosstalk with fibroblast and cotargeting CXCR1/2 and CDK4/6 could potentially overcome endocrine resistant breast cancer.",
