  "title": "Antireflux Ureteral Stent Improves Stent-Related Symptoms and Quality of Life: A Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.",
  "abstract": "Objectives: To compare the effectiveness of antireflux ureteral stents on improving symptoms and quality of life of patients with ureteral stents. Materials and Methods: We randomized 120 patients with ureteral stone who required ureteral stent placement after ureteroscopic lithotripsy, of which 107 (56 in standard ureteral stent group and 51 in antireflux ureteral stent group) entered the final analysis. Severity of flank pain and suprapubic pain, visual analog scale (VAS), analgesic used after hospitalization, back soreness during micturition, gross hematuria, creatinine abnormality, hydronephrosis grade, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI), and quality of life were compared between the two groups. Results: There were no serious complications after operation in all 107 cases. The antireflux ureteral stent group had less flank pain and suprapubic pain (p < 0.05), analgesic used after hospitalization (p < 0.05), back soreness during micturition (p < 0.05), and lower VAS (p < 0.05). The health status index scores (p < 0.05), dimensions of usual activities, and pain/discomfort (p < 0.05) in the antireflux ureteral stent group were statistically better than those in the standard ureteral stent group. There were no significant differences between the groups in creatinine abnormality, hydronephrosis grade, gross hematuria, and symptomatic UTI. Conclusions: The antireflux ureteral stent has the same safety and efficacy as the standard ureteral stent, and is significantly better than the standard ureteral stent in flank pain and suprapubic pain, VAS, analgesic used after hospitalization, back soreness during micturition, and quality of life.",
