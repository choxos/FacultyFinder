  "title": "OCT-based diagnosis, management, and predictors of recurrent stent failure: a cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Stent failure (SF) is a complication of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the relationship of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) determined cause of SF with time since stent implantation, treatment, and outcome. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients who underwent an OCT evaluation for SF from January 2013 to July 2023. In-stent findings were evaluated on OCT including tissue proliferation, tissue type, underexpansion, thrombus, and multiple stent layers. The relationship between time to presentation, treatment, and outcome was assessed. RESULTS: Of the 309 patients who underwent an OCT-guided PCI for SF, tissue proliferation was present in 228 (74%) and absent in 81 (26%). Among patients with tissue proliferation, OCT commonly showed lipidic neointima (n = 122, 54%), thrombus (n = 81, 36%), and underexpansion (n = 71, 31%). In patients without tissue proliferation, OCT commonly identified underexpansion (n = 58, 72%), thrombus (n = 55, 68%), and uncovered struts (n = 37, 46%). The mean time to SF was 6.89 ± 5.88 years with tissue proliferation and 2.98 ± 3.75 years without (p < 0.001). Patients with tissue proliferation were more likely to be treated with repeat stenting (78% vs. 60%, p < 0.001). Lipidic neointimal tissue and >1 layer of stent were predictors of target SF recurrence during a median 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION: In a large series of OCT-guided treatments of SF, tissue proliferation was more common, occurred later after stent implantation, and was more likely to be treated with repeat stenting than no-tissue proliferation. Lipidic neointimal tissue and >1 layer of stent were significant predictors of target SF during follow-up.",
