  "abstract": "While the opioid epidemic has garnered worldwide attention, increasing methamphetamine use has drawn less scrutiny. Methamphetamine is a highly addictive psychostimulant affecting people from all backgrounds and regions. It is a potent vasoconstrictor, is associated with arrhythmias and dilated cardiomyopathy. Cardiovascular disease-related mortality is a leading cause of death in methamphetamine users. Women of childbearing age increasingly use methamphetamine and continue during pregnancy. In the short term, prenatal methamphetamine use is associated with fetal growth restriction and low birth weight in the newborn. Animal studies show reduction in uterine and umbilical blood flow following maternal methamphetamine administration. Based on currently available evidence, prenatal methamphetamine exposure has transient effects on gross motor development, no effect on language and cognition, and modest effects on behavior and executive functioning with poor inhibitory control, which may be attributable to early adversity. Further research is needed to evaluate long-term effects of prenatal methamphetamine exposure.",
