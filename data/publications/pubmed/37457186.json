  "abstract": "Carob is botanically called as Ceratonia siliqua and belongs to the Legumes family. The fruit is derived from hermaphrodite trees and hard in shape. The carob contains high sugar contents in pulp, fat in seed and minerals like potassium, calcium, and phosphorus are present in pods. Polyphenols and antioxidants are abundant in leaves and pods. It can be used for enhancing human health due to its high nutritional profile. Carob gum is used in the pharmaceutical industry in the form of pomades, anti-celiac ingredients, pills, and dental paste. The clinical carob can aid as an anti-cancer, anti-reflux, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-hyperlipidemia, anti-bacterial, anti-microbial, and anti-fungal. Nowadays, carob seeds are being used as an alternative to cocoa powder in food items whereas the leaves, pods, and seeds of carob are also historically used as food for animal feed. However, these parts of carob are available in markets with reasonable prices. Carob production, though with a rising contribution, contributes to the local economy. In this sense, we can incorporate knowledge on the chemical properties and the biological effect of carob fruits on human health. In this study, the supportive and health-promoting impacts of carob are discussed along with the clinical testing obtained from natural constituents of carob. In addition, further studies can be performed to extract and separate polyphenols and antioxidant potential for the development of functional that play a valuable role in pharmaceutical and food sectors.",
