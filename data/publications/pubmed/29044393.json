  "abstract": "AIMS: There is a paucity of real-world, contemporary data of practice patterns and clinical outcomes following dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). METHODS AND RESULTS: The Canadian Observational Antiplatelet Study was a prospective, multicentre, cohort study examining adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist use following PCI for AMI. We compared practice patterns, patient characteristics, and clinical outcomes in relation to DAPT duration (<6 weeks, 6 weeks to <6 months, 6 to <12, and ≥12 months). The primary outcome was the composite of non-fatal AMI, unplanned coronary revascularization, stent thrombosis, new or worsening heart failure, cardiogenic shock, or stroke. We identified 2034 patients with AMI treated with PCI. DAPT duration was <6 weeks in 5.2% of patients; 6 weeks to <6 months in 7.0%; 6 to <12 months in 12.6%; and ≥12 months in 75.3%. Patients who discontinued DAPT early had higher GRACE risk scores. Overall, mortality rate at 15 months was 2.5%. Compared with a duration of DAPT of ≥12 months, discontinuation of DAPT <6 weeks (P < 0.0001) and 6 weeks to <6 months (P = 0.02), but not 6 months to <12 months (P = 0.06), were independently associated with a higher incidence of the primary outcome among survivors. CONCLUSION: One-in-four patients with AMI treated with PCI discontinued DAPT prior to the guideline-recommended 12-month duration. Patients in whom DAPT was discontinued early were at higher baseline risk and had higher rates of non-fatal ischaemic events during follow up.",
