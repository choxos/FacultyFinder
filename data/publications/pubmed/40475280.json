  "title": "\"Interest-holders\": A new term to replace \"stakeholders\" in the context of health research and policy.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Given the colonial connotations of the term \"stakeholder\", its continued use may be perceived as disrespectful to Indigenous Peoples. While several groups have introduced alternative terms, each has its own limitations. The objective of this article is to introduce \"interest-holders\" as an alternative term to \"stakeholders\" and describe the discussions underpinning the adoption of the new term by the MuSE Consortium. METHODS: The MuSE Consortium is an international network of over 160 individuals with interest and expertise in different aspects relevant to engagement in research. Members of MuSE explored alternative terms and considered their respective merits and limitations. The deliberations considered the literature on the topic and the results of two consultations with the wider MuSE membership on the alternative terms. RESULTS: We define \"interest-holders\" as groups with legitimate interests in the health issue under consideration. The interests arise and draw their legitimacy from the fact that people from these groups are responsible for or affected by health-related decisions that can be informed by research evidence. CONCLUSION: As groups other than the MuSE Consortium have started to adopt \"interest-holders,\" we hope its use will reduce confusion related to the multitude of terms used and convey the intended meaning without any negative connotations.",
