  "title": "Association of statin use and lipid levels with cerebral microbleeds and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with atrial fibrillation: A prospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with statins has been reported, but data on the relationship between statin use and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), a population at high bleeding and cardiovascular risk, are lacking. AIMS: To explore the association between statin use and blood lipid levels with the prevalence and progression of CMBs in patients with AF with a particular focus on anticoagulated patients. METHODS: Data of Swiss-AF, a prospective cohort of patients with established AF, were analyzed. Statin use was assessed during baseline and throughout follow-up. Lipid values were measured at baseline. CMBs were assessed using magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) at baseline and at 2 years follow-up. Imaging data were centrally assessed by blinded investigators. Associations of statin use and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels with CMB prevalence at baseline or CMB progression (at least one additional or new CMB on follow-up MRI at 2 years compared with baseline) were assessed using logistic regression models; the association with ICH was assessed using flexible parametric survival models. Models were adjusted for hypertension, smoking, body mass index, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack, coronary heart disease, antiplatelet use, anticoagulant use, and education. RESULTS: Of the 1693 patients with CMB data at baseline MRI (mean ± SD age 72.5 ± 8.4 years, 27.6% women, 90.1% on oral anticoagulants), 802 patients (47.4%) were statin users. The multivariable adjusted odds ratio (adjOR) for CMBs prevalence at baseline for statin users was 1.10 (95% CI = 0.83-1.45). AdjOR for 1 unit increase in LDL levels was 0.95 (95% CI = 0.82-1.10). At 2 years, 1188 patients had follow-up MRI. CMBs progression was observed in 44 (8.0%) statin users and 47 (7.4%) non-statin users. Of these patients, 64 (70.3%) developed a single new CMB, 14 (15.4%) developed 2 CMBs, and 13 developed more than 3 CMBs. The multivariable adjOR for statin users was 1.09 (95% CI = 0.66-1.80). There was no association between LDL levels and CMB progression (adjOR 1.02, 95% CI = 0.79-1.32). At follow-up 14 (1.2%) statin users had ICH versus 16 (1.3%) non-users. The age and sex adjusted hazard ratio (adjHR) was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.36-1.55). The results remained robust in sensitivity analyses excluding participants without anticoagulants. CONCLUSIONS: In this prospective cohort of patients with AF, a population at increased hemorrhagic risk due to anticoagulation, the use of statins was not associated with an increased risk of CMBs.",
