  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Adolescence is a critical period for psychosocial development, often marked by elevated stress levels. The present study examines the role of psychosocial factors as predictors of adolescent stress, with a focus on personality traits, social support, and family health. METHODS: A cross-sectional sample of 1,104 school-going adolescents from Telangana, India were analysed. Using the Adolescence Stress Scale and various psychosocial scales, hierarchical multiple regression and path analysis were employed to assess direct and indirect effects of psychosocial variables on stress levels. RESULTS: Key predictors of stress included ill-health experiences, conscientiousness, emotional instability, and psychosocial support. Together, these factors explained 6 % of the variance in stress. Serial mediation analysis revealed significant indirect effects, where family health and emotional efficacy acted as mediators between psychosocial factors and stress. Emotional instability and frustrative non-reward responsiveness were the strongest predictors of stress. CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial factors play a significant but modest role in adolescent stress, highlighting the need for further research into additional contributors. Interventions targeting family health and emotional regulation may alleviate stress among adolescents.",
