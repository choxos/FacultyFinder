  "title": "Association between hyperuricaemia and hand osteoarthritis: data from the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis of hand osteoarthritis (OA) remains unknown. Hyperuricaemia, which is related to inflammation, may play a role in hand OA, but evidence is lacking. In a large population-based study, we examined the association between hyperuricaemia and hand OA. METHODS: Participants were from the Xiangya OA Study, a community-based observational study. Hyperuricaemia was defined as serum urate >416 µmol/L in men and >357 µmol/L in women. Radiographic hand OA (RHOA) was defined as presence of the modified Kellgren-Lawrence grade ≥2 in any hand joint. Symptomatic hand OA (SHOA) was defined as presence of both self-reported symptoms and RHOA in the same hand. The associations of hyperuricaemia with RHOA or SHOA were examined using generalised estimating equations. RESULTS: Among 3628 participants, the prevalence of RHOA was higher in participants with hyperuricaemia than those with normouricaemia (26.9% vs 20.9%), with an adjusted OR (aOR) of 1.34 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.61). The associations were consistent in men (aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.74) and women (aOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.74). Hyperuricaemia was mainly associated with bilateral RHOA (aOR 1.54, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.01) but not unilateral RHOA (aOR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.45). Prevalence of SHOA was higher, although statistically insignificant, in participants with hyperuricaemia (aOR 1.39, 95% CI 0.94 to 2.07). CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, hyperuricaemia was associated with a higher prevalence of hand OA. Future prospective studies are required to investigate the temporal relationship.
