  "title": "Double-guidewire technique in difficult biliary cannulation for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Background and study aims Difficult cannulation is a risk factor for pancreatitis following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The double-guidewire technique (DGT) may improve cannulation success and reduce the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) in patients with difficult cannulation. This systematic review compared the DGT with persistent conventional cannulation or other advanced techniques in patients with difficult cannulation. Patients and Methods CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases and DDW and UEGW abstracts up to March 2016 were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing DGT with persistent conventional cannulation or other advanced techniques (precut, pancreatic duct [PD] stenting). The primary outcome was PEP. Secondary outcomes included severity of PEP, successful cannulation of the common bile duct (CBD) with the randomized technique, overall CBD cannulation success, and ERCP-related complications. Results 7 RCTs (577 patients) were included. Use of the DGT significantly increased PEP compared to other endoscopic techniques (risk ratio [RR] 1.98, 95 % confidence interval [95 %CI] 1.14 - 3.42). There was no significant difference in CBD cannulation success with the randomized technique (RR 1.04, 95 %CI 0.87 - 1.24) or in overall cannulation success (RR 1.04, 95 %CI 0.91 - 1.18) between DGT and other techniques. There was also no significant difference in the risk of other ERCP-related complications (bleeding, perforation, cholangitis, and mortality). The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions In patients with difficult cannulation, sole use of the DGT appears to increase the risk of PEP without any superiority in achieving biliary cannulation compared to other techniques. PD stenting may reduce the risk of PEP when the DGT is used. The influence of co-intervention in the form of per-procedural nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) administration is unclear.",
