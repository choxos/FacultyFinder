  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) has been shown to alleviate inflammatory processes in the gastrointestinal tract. The aim of this study was to determine if blockade of the RAS would be effective in an immunologically relevant colitis model, and to compare outcome with an acute colitis model. METHODS: A losartan analog, CCG-203025 (C23H26ClN3O5S) containing a highly polar sulfonic acid moiety that we expected would allow localized mucosal antagonism with minimal systemic absorption was selected as an angiotensin II type 1a receptor antagonist (AT1aR-A). Two colitis models were studied: (1) Acute colitis was induced in 8- to 10-week-old C57BL/6J mice by 2.5 % dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, in drinking water) for 7 days. (2) IL10-/-colitis Piroxicam (200 ppm) was administered orally in feed to 5-week-old IL-10-/-mice (C57BL/6J background) for 14 days followed by enalaprilat (ACE-I), CCG-203025 or PBS administered transanally for 14 days. RESULTS: In the DSS model, weight loss and histologic score for CCG-203025 were better than with placebo. In the IL10-/-model, ACE-I suppressed histologic damage better than CCG-203025. Both ACE-I and CCG-203025 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the therapeutic efficacy of both ACE-I and AT1aR-A for preventing the development of both acute and immunologically relevant colitis.",
