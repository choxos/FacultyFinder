  "abstract": "Rhabdomyolysis is a syndrome caused by injury to skeletal muscle and subsequent release of intracellular components into the systemic circulation. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis causing acute paralysis from underlying and unrecognized hypothyroidism in an 11-year-old girl. To date, publications of rhabdomyolysis secondary to hypothyroidism have been limited, especially in the pediatric population. Early intervention with intravenous fluids and levothyroxine led to resolution of our patient's symptoms and is overall important in preventing the serious sequela of rhabdomyolysis including renal failure, cardiac dysrhythmias, compartment syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.",
