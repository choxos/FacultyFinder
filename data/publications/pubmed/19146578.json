  "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important nosocomial pathogen, which is responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in the United Kingdom. The major reservoir of this organism is thought to be the anterior nares, but there is increasing evidence that this pathogen is present in the oral cavity, particularly in denture wearers. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MRSA, grown as biofilms on denture acrylic resin, could be eradicated using commercially available agents. EMRSA-15 or EMRSA-16 was grown in a model system on the surface of denture acrylic resin for 4, 24 or 120 h before the samples were exposed to a range of disinfectants for time intervals of 1, 5 and 10 min. All of the agents reduced the number of cultivable MRSA bacteria present on the acrylic resin surface at 4 h, with 2% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) eliminating MRSA below the level of detection after an exposure of 1 min. However, the established MRSA biofilms (24 and 120 h) were more resistant to killing by the agents, although 2% NaOCl was still able to eradicate all ages of MRSA biofilms within 1 min of exposure.",
