  "title": "The Impact of Surgical Wait Time and Hospital Stay on the Incidence of Burn Wound Infection and Related Complications at a Single Tertiary Hospital Centre: A 10-Year Experience.",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Admitted patients with burn injuries require prompt treatment and shorter hospital stays to avoid hospital-acquired infections and associated complications. This study aimed to determine the impact of time to the first surgery, and total length of hospital stay on the incidence of BWI and associated complications in adult patients with moderate burn injuries at a single tertiary hospital burn center. Methods: A retrospective chart review identified burn patients admitted to the Burn Unit between January 2011 and January 2021. The incidences of BWI and complications were documented. Univariate logistic regressions were performed, with significance set at P < .05. Results: A total of 171 patients were included in the study. The mean age was 50.8 years (range, 94-18 years), with 64 (37.4%) females. The mean wait time for surgery and total hospital stay was 2.6 days (SD = 2.5; 1-15 days) and 18.6 days (SD = 16.0; 1-125 days), respectively. Precisely, 47 patients (27.5%) were associated with positive burn wound cultures, with 23 patients (13.5%) experiencing clinical burn wound complications. Wait time to surgery did not significantly impact the incidence of BWI (OR = 0.97, P = .72) or related complications (OR = 0.97, P = .61). Total hospital stay was significantly associated with the incidence of BWI (OR = 1.05, P < .001) and related complications (OR = 1.02, P = .03). Conclusions: Delay to surgery may not be a significant risk factor of BWI and related complications in patients with burn injuries. Half of positive burn wound cultures are associated with objective clinical infection and subsequent complications. However, total hospital stay may be clinically important.",
