  "title": "Update on all-arthroscopic vs. mini-open rotator cuff repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To provide an updated comparison between modern arthroscopic and mini-open repairs for treating rotator cuff tears. METHODS: Multiple online databases were searched from 2010 to October 1st, 2020. A meta-analysis was conducted for patient-reported outcomes and complications. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. Majority of patients underwent mini-open repair (MOR) compared to arthroscopic repair (AR) (57.4% vs 42.6%). A meta-analysis found statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) in patient-reported outcomes favouring AR. While retear rates were higher in AR (p = 0.03) analysis of retear rates for arthroscopic double row and mini-open repairs, yielded no differences between groups (p = 0.48). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing AR for rotator cuff tears had improved post-operative clinical outcomes in some functional outcomes compared to MOR. Modern arthroscopic double row repair result in similar failure rates to open repair techniques. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, Systematic Review of Level I-III studies.",
