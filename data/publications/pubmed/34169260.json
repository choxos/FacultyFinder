  "title": "Implications of the Antiplatelet Therapy Gap Left With Discontinuation of Prasugrel in Canada.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The current Canadian Cardiovascular Society antiplatelet therapy guidelines recommend the use of ticagrelor or prasugrel over clopidogrel as first-line platelet P2Y12 receptor antagonists for treatment of moderate- to high-risk acute coronary syndromes. Recently, Effient (prasugrel [Eli Lilly Canada Inc, Toronto, Canada]) was discontinued by its distributor in Canada. METHODS: Five members of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society antiplatelet therapy 2018 guidelines committee undertook an independent, evidence-based review to outline patients for whom prasugrel should be the optimal P2Y12 agent and discuss alternative strategies to consider without prasugrel. RESULTS: Several clinical scenarios where prasugrel should be indicated are identified and discussed. Considerations to be undertaken for alternative therapies are summarized, including a review of national and international guidelines for de-escalation of P2Y12 receptor antagonists. CONCLUSIONS: The discontinuation of prasugrel poses a challenge for clinicians. Clinicians must consider key factors in determining the best alternate therapy.",
