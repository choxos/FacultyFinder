  "title": "Methods, design, and initial results of an angiographic core lab from VOYAGER-PAD.",
  "abstract": "Background: Anatomy is critical in risk stratification and therapeutic decision making in coronary disease. The relationship between anatomy and outcomes is not well described in PAD. We sought to develop an angiographic core lab within the VOYAGER-PAD trial. The current report describes the methods of creating this core lab, its study population, and baseline anatomic variables. Methods: Patients undergoing lower-extremity revascularization for symptomatic PAD were randomized in VOYAGER-PAD. The median follow up was 2.25 years. Events were adjudicated by a blinded Clinical Endpoint Committee. Angiograms were collected from study participants; those with available angiograms formed this core lab cohort. Angiograms were scored for anatomic and flow characteristics by trained reviewers blinded to treatment. Ten percent of angiograms were evaluated independently by two reviewers; inter-rater agreement was assessed. Clinical characteristics and the treatment effect of rivaroxaban were compared between the core lab cohort and noncore lab participants. Anatomic data by segment were analyzed. Results: Of 6564 participants randomized in VOYAGER-PAD, catheter-based angiograms from 1666 patients were obtained for this core lab. Anatomic and flow characteristics were collected across 16 anatomic segments by 15 reviewers. Concordance between reviewers for anatomic and flow variables across segments was 90.5% (24,417/26,968). Clinical characteristics were similar between patients in the core lab and those not included. The effect of rivaroxaban on the primary efficacy and safety outcomes was also similar. Conclusions: The VOYAGER-PAD angiographic core lab provides an opportunity to correlate PAD anatomy with independently adjudicated outcomes and provide insights into therapy for PAD.
