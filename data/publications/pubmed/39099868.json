  "abstract": "Motivation to learn has been linked to learning outcomes, academic performance, learner well-being, and choice of medical specialty. Previous studies showed successful educational interventions to optimize students' levels of motivation and learning strategies. The purposes of this study are (1) to describe undergraduate medical students' motivational orientations and learning strategies in the first and last year at a Canadian university and (2) to analyze possible differences between undergraduate medical students' motivational orientations and learning strategies in those two academic years. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted using the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ). The survey was sent to a total of 207 first-year and 203 third-year students. We received a total of 58 surveys, 32 of them were complete and analyzed. The overall response rate was 14.1%. The internal consistency for all the scales varied from 0.61 to 0.904. The overall score for the survey was 4.97 on a 7-point scale for all students. Highest scales' scores were obtained for elaboration (mean 5.68) and learning beliefs (mean 5.64), with the lowest scores obtained for rehearsal (3.82) and test anxiety (3.94). The total scores did not differ by students' academic year (p = 0.764), except for the effort regulation scale in which first-year students scored higher (p = 0.01). The largest differences between first- and last-year students were found in effort regulation, where first-years scored higher (difference of 0.99), followed by peer learning (difference of - 0.51), and then test anxiety (- 0.36). Our results showed a sample of students that are highly motivated, mostly driven by intrinsic goals, and are confident that they will master the tasks given to them. They rely more on elaboration strategies building connections between new and prior information, and less in rehearsal strategies used for simple tasks and memorization. The MSLQ showed to be a reliable instrument in our sample, and it could be use as an instrument to identify students' adaptive changes to enhance students' motivation to learn. A portrayal of medical students' attitudes in learning could guide educators to develop instructional programs that would help students to optimize their own learning.",
