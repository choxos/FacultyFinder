  "title": "Encouraging older adults with pre-frailty and frailty to \"MoveStrong\": an analysis of secondary outcomes for a pilot randomized controlled trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This 8-week pilot stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial evaluated the MoveStrong program for teaching adults who have frailty/pre-frailty about balance and functional strength training and sufficient protein intake to prevent falls and improve mobility. METHODS: We recruited individuals aged 60 years and over, with a FRAIL scale score of 1 or higher and at least one chronic condition, who were not currently strength training. The program included 16 exercise physiologist-led hour-long group sessions and two dietitian-led hour-long nutrition sessions. We analyzed secondary outcomes-weight, gait speed, grip strength, physical capacity (fatigue levels), sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity levels and protein intake-using a paired t test and a generalized estimating equation (GEE). RESULTS: Of 44 participants (mean [SD] age 79 [9.82] years), 35 were pre-frail and 9 were frail. At follow-up, participants had significantly improved grip strength (1.63 kg, 95% CI: 0.62 to 2.63); sit-to-stand functioning (2 sit-to-stands, 95% CI: 1 to 3); and dynamic balance (1.68 s, 95% CI: 0.47 to 2.89). There were no significant improvements in gait speed, HRQoL index scores, self-rated health, physical activity levels (aerobic activity and strength training) or protein intake. GEE analysis revealed an interaction between exposure to MoveStrong and gait speed, sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance and HRQoL index scores. The total cost to administer the program and purchase equipment was CAD 14 700, equivalent to CAD 377 per participant. CONCLUSION: Exploratory analyses suggest MoveStrong exercises may improve gait speed, sit-to-stand functioning, dynamic balance and HRQoL index scores in older individuals who are frail and pre-frail.",
