  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To offer a systematic review of the body of literature in the emerging field of telemedicine in the management of acute-phase injuries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a literature review. RESULTS: Telemedicine has only recently been applied to the specialties of trauma, emergency care, and surgery. The potential benefits of telemedicine include a decrease in travel expenses, enhanced continuity of care, and increased access to specialized consultants in medically underserved and rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: There still exist barriers to the use of teletechnologies in medicine that limit their wider adoption. Poor infrastructure, limited equipment availability, and insufficient access to training and education for medical personnel have prevented wider use.",
