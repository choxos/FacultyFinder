  "title": "Atypical Polycystic Kidney Disease as defined by Imaging.",
  "abstract": "Using age- and height-adjusted total kidney volume, the Mayo Clinic Imaging Classification provides a validated approach to assess the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), but requires excluding patients with atypical imaging patterns, whose clinical characteristics have been poorly defined. We report an analysis of the prevalence, clinical and genetic characteristics of patients with atypical polycystic kidney disease by imaging. Patients from the extended Toronto Genetic Epidemiology Study of Polycystic Kidney Disease recruited between 2016 and 2018 completed a standardized clinical questionnaire, kidney function assessment, genetic testing, and kidney imaging by magnetic resonance or computed tomography. We compared the prevalence, clinical features, genetics, and renal prognosis of atypical versus typical polycystic kidney disease by imaging. Forty-six of the 523 (8.8%) patients displayed atypical polycystic kidney disease by imaging; they were older (55 vs. 43 years; P < 0.001), and less likely to have a family history of ADPKD (26.1% vs. 74.6%; P < 0.001), a detectable PKD1 or PKD2 mutation (9.2% vs. 80.4%; P < 0.001), or progression to CKD stage 3 or stage 5 (P < 0.001). Patients with atypical polycystic kidney disease by imaging represent a distinct prognostic group with a low likelihood of progression to CKD.",
