  "abstract": "Excess glucocorticoids (GCs) cause muscle atrophy. Glucocorticoid-induced muscle atrophy is associated with increased intramuscular myostatin expression. Myostatin is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle mass. Glutamine prevents GC-induced muscle atrophy. We hypothesized that glutamine effect on reversal of GC-induced muscle atrophy is mediated in part by suppression of myostatin. We administered daily to male Sprague-Dawley rats dexamethasone, dexamethasone plus glutamine, saline or saline plus glutamine, all pair-fed. Animals were killed on day 5. Body weight and weights of gastrocnemius muscles were measured. Myostatin expression was measured by Northern and Western blots, and was compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Myoblast C2C12 cells were exposed to dexamethasone, or dexamethasone and glutamine, and their myostatin messenger RNA and protein expression compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Myostatin promoter activity was measured by luciferase activity of transfected C2C12 cells, grown in medium including dexamethasone, or dexamethasone plus glutamine. Rats that received dexamethasone showed significant body and muscle weight loss accompanied by an increase in intramuscular myostatin expression, compared with their saline-treated controls. Pair-fed rats given dexamethasone plus glutamine had significantly less reduction in body and muscle weights and lower myostatin expression when compared with those treated with dexamethasone alone. In C2C12 myoblast cells, addition of glutamine to dexamethasone prevented the hyperexpression of myostatin induced by dexamethasone. Myostatin promoter activity increased in cells exposed to dexamethasone, but this increase was partially blocked by addition of the glutamine. Administration of glutamine partially prevents GC-induced myostatin expression and muscle atrophy, providing a potential mechanism for the prevention of muscle atrophy induced by glucocorticoids.",
