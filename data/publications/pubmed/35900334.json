  "title": "Statin Use May Be Associated With a Lower Risk of Invasive Aspergillosis in Lung Transplant Recipients.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Statins are competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) that catalyses HMG-CoA conversion to mevalonate, a process involved in synthesizing cholesterol in humans and ergosterol in fungi. The effect of statin use on the risk of development of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in lung transplant recipients (LTRs) is not well documented. METHODS: This retrospective study included LTRs from 2010 to 2017 who were followed for one-year post-transplant. Proven or probable IA was diagnosed as per ISHLT criteria. We performed a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model of the association between IA and statin use (minimum of 2 weeks duration prior to IA), adjusting for other known IA risk factors. RESULTS: We identified 785 LTRs, 44% female, mean age 53 years old, the most common underlying disease being pulmonary fibrosis (23.8%). In total, 451 LTRs (57%) received statins post-transplant, atorvastatin was the most commonly used statin (68%). The mean duration of statins post-transplant was 347 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 305 to 346). And 55 (7%) LTRs developed IA in the first-year post-transplant. Out of these 55 LTRs, 9 (16.3%) had received statin before developing IA. In multivariable analysis, statin use was independently associated with a lower risk of IA (P = .002, SHR 0.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 95% .14-.64). Statin use was also associated with a lower incidence of post-transplant Aspergillus colonization, 114 (34%) in the no statin group vs 123 (27%) in the statin group (P = .038). CONCLUSIONS: The use of statin for a minimum of two weeks during the first-year post-transplant was associated with a 70% risk reduction of IA in LTRs.",
