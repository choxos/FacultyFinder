  "title": "Scale-up of Global Child and Youth Mental Health Services: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "Numerous influential policy and scientific bodies are calling for more rapid advances in the scale-up of child and youth mental health services (CYMHS). A number of CYMHS innovations hold promise for advancing scale-up but little is known about how real-world efforts are progressing. We conducted a scoping review to identify promising approaches to CYMHS scale-up across the globe. Searches were completed in six databases (Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsychInfo, PubMed, and Web of Science). Article selection and synthesis were conducted in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A second search focused on low-and-middle-income countries (LMIC) was conducted based on the Cochrane Library recommended search filters of the World Bank listed LMIC countries. Authors used a double coding strategy during the title/abstract and full-text review. Twenty-eight articles meeting the eligibility criteria were identified that described 22 initiatives (in 11 different countries). Our review found the majority of published scale-up studies in CYMHS were not informed by scale-up frameworks in design or reporting. The methods and outcomes used in the identified articles were highly variable and limited our ability to draw conclusions about comparative effectiveness although promising approaches emerged. Successes and failures identified in our review largely reflect consensus in the broader literature regarding the need for strategies to better navigate the complexities of system and policy implementation while ensuring CYMHS interventions fit local contexts.",
