  "title": "Glucose enhances rat islet function via stimulating CART expression.",
  "abstract": "Cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) is an anorexigenic peptide widely expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, as well as in endocrine cells. CART is markedly upregulated in the β-cells of several rodent models of type-2 diabetes. The stimulatory effect of exogenous CART peptide on insulin secretion is cAMP dependent. Glucose is the most important regulator of islet function. However, the role of CART in glucose-potentiated insulin secretion remains unclear. Here, our results showed that glucose time- and dose-dependently elicited CART mRNA expression in rat islets. Both the glucokinase agonist GKA50 and the long-acting GLP-1 analogue exendin-4 increased CART mRNA expression. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor H89 and the inactivation of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) suppressed forskolin-stimulated CART mRNA expression. Furthermore, CART overexpression amplified insulin secretion from rat islets in response to glucose and forskolin, and ameliorated dexamethasone-impaired insulin secretion. These findings suggest that islet-derived CART is involved, at least in part, in high glucose-potentiated pancreatic β-cell function.",
