  "title": "Corticosteroids compared with intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.",
  "abstract": "Treatment options for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in pregnancy are limited, and evidence to guide management decisions is lacking. This retrospective study of singleton pregnancies from 2 tertiary centers compared the effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and corticosteroids in treatment of ITP. Data from 195 women who had 235 pregnancies were reviewed. Treatment was not required in 137 pregnancies (58%). Of the remaining 98 pregnancies in 91 women, 47 (48%) were treated with IVIg and 51 were treated with corticosteroids as the initial intervention. Mean maternal platelet count at birth did not differ between groups (IVIg 69 × 10(9)/L vs corticosteroids 77 × 10(9)/L; P = .71) nor did the proportion of mothers who achieved a platelet count response (IVIg 38% vs corticosteroids 39%; P = .85). There were no fatal or severe maternal, fetal, or neonatal hemorrhages. Of 203 neonates in whom platelet counts were available, 56 (28%) had a birth platelet count <150 × 10(9)/L and 18 (9%) had platelet counts <50 × 10(9)/L. Nadir platelet counts for most affected neonates occurred at birth, although for some neonates, nadir platelet counts occurred up to 6 days postnatally. Intracranial hemorrhage was noted in 2 neonates (nadir platelet counts were 135 and 18 × 10(9)/L). There were no neonatal deaths. The majority of pregnant women with a history of ITP did not require treatment, and neonatal outcomes were comparable for mothers who received IVIg or corticosteroids for treatment of maternal ITP.",
