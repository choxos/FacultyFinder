  "title": "Ischaemic cardiomyopathy and embolic stroke in a young adult with suspected synthetic cannabinoid use.",
  "abstract": "The incidence of cardiovascular disease is increasing in young adults. We are reporting a case of acute stroke in a young patient with severe ischaemic cardiomyopathy in the absence of traditional risk factors. After ruling out atherosclerotic disease, his presentation was attributed to synthetic cannabinoid use. We then discussed the typical barriers in early diagnosis and limitations of laboratory testing in this condition. Due to the increase in abuse of these synthetic drugs among young adults, there is a need for high clinical suspicion which can help with early recognition and improve morbidity and mortality associated with these chemicals.",
