  "title": "High-resolution proteomics reveals differences in the proteome of spelt and bread wheat flour representing targets for research on wheat sensitivities.",
  "abstract": "Wheat consumption can trigger celiac disease, allergic reactions and non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) in humans. Some people with NCWS symptoms claim a better tolerability of spelt compared to bread wheat products. We therefore investigated potential differences in the proteomes of spelt and bread wheat flour using nano LC-ESI-MS/MS on a set of 15 representative varieties for each of the two species. Based on the bread wheat reference, we detected 3,050 proteins in total and for most of them the expression was mainly affected by the environment. By contrast, 274 and 409 proteins in spelt and bread wheat, respectively, had a heritability ≥ 0.4 highlighting the potential to influence their expression level by varietal choice. We found 84 and 193 unique proteins for spelt and bread wheat, respectively, and 396 joint proteins, which expression differed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) when comparing both species. Thus, about one third of proteins differed significantly between spelt and bread wheat. Of them, we identified 81 proteins with high heritability, which therefore might be interesting candidates for future research on wheat hypersensitivities.",
