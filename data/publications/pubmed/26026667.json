  "title": "A Checklist for Reporting Valuation Studies of Multi-Attribute Utility-Based Instruments (CREATE).",
  "abstract": "Multi-attribute utility-based instruments (MAUIs) assess health status and provide an index score on the full health-dead scale, and are widely used to support reimbursement decisions for new healthcare interventions worldwide. A valuation study is a key part of the development of MAUIs, with the primary goal of developing a scoring algorithm through eliciting societal preferences. We developed the 21-item Checklist for REporting VAluaTion StudiEs (CREATE) by following a modified two-round Delphi panel approach plus an email survey. CREATE is intended to promote good reporting practice as well as guiding developers to thoroughly and carefully think through key methodological elements in designing valuation studies.",
