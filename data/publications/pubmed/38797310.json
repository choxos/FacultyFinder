  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peridevice leak (PDL) after left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) portends adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence, predictors, clinical implications, and temporal evolution of PDL after LAAC. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study included all patients who underwent LAAC with Watchman FLX and had no PDL detected at the time of implantation. The primary end point was the incidence of new PDL at initial imaging. The composite secondary end point included continued oral anticoagulation after initial imaging, device-related thrombus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, major bleeding, and need for PDL closure at longest follow-up. Temporal evolution of PDL was assessed in patients with available surveillance imaging. RESULTS: Of the 355 patients who completed imaging at 47 days (interquartile range [IQR] 44-50 days), 139 (39%) had new PDL with a mean leak size of 3.2 ± 1.4 mm (median 3.0 mm; IQR 2.0-4.0 mm; range 1.0-9.0 mm). Multiple deployment attempts and larger device size were positive predictors of PDL, while increased contrast volume administration was a negative predictor of PDL. The composite secondary end point occurred in 42 (30%) patients with PDL and 33 (15%) patients without PDL (P < .001). Of the 139 patients with PDL, 43 (31%) had surveillance imaging where the leak size regressed from 3.7 ± 1.8 mm at 46 days (IQR 44-51 days) to 1.7 ± 2.0 mm at 189 days (IQR 158-285 days) (P < .001). The leak size regressed in 33 (77%), remained stable in 4 (9%), and progressed in 6 (14%) cases. CONCLUSION: Despite design improvements, LAAC with Watchman FLX demonstrates a significant incidence of PDL with meaningful clinical implications. Regardless of initial size, most leaks regressed over time.",
