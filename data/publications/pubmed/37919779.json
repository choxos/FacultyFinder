  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty regarding the role of obesity in type 1 diabetes development. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to collect and synthesize evidence regarding BMI and the risk of developing type 1 diabetes. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the association between BMI and incident type 1 diabetes. Databases were searched up to June 2022. Cohort studies were included reporting the association between overweight and/or obesity, as measured by BMI after age 2 years, with incident type 1 diabetes. Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed study quality. Risk estimates were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Ten cohort studies met the inclusion criteria. The seven studies that classified BMI into categories were of high quality and involved 1,690,660 individuals and 1979 incident type 1 diabetes cases. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for type 1 diabetes was 1.35 (95% CI 0.93-1.97) among people with overweight (3 studies); 2.17 (95% CI 1.75-2.69) among people with obesity (5 studies); and 1Â·87 (95% CI 1.52-2.29) among people with overweight/obesity (two studies merged the categories). These point estimates persisted in sensitivity analyses that addressed the duration of follow-up, variability in baseline risk for incident type 1 diabetes, and potential misclassifications related to exposure or outcome definitions. People with overweight/obesity had a 2.55 (95% CI 1.11-5.86) greater risk for incident type 1 diabetes with positive islet autoantibodies. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis of high-quality observational cohort studies indicated an association between high BMI and the risk of type 1 diabetes, in a graded manner.",
