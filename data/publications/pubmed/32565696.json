  "abstract": "A look into the associations of socioeconomic status (SES) with prevalence of various complications in sickle cell disease (SCD) is necessary, for an improvement of societal norms, governmental health policies and strategies. We therefore studied the influence of SES indices on certain hematological and clinical parameters in children with SCD in Saudi Arabia. We included 32 female and 33 male patients aged 5-16 years, who were classified based upon their family income. Family monthly income was divided into 4 categories from lowest to highest, with socioeconomic class1 having low earnings of <5000 SAR; the middle income class divided further into class 2 with earnings >5000-10,000 SAR, and class 3 with earnings >10,000-15,000 SAR; and the higher income class 4 with earnings of >15,000 SAR. The assessment indices used were, the frequency of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), adverse events, and hematological parameters. A higher percentage of children affected with the disease were from class1, which is the low socio-economic class. It was found that the percentage of frequency of VOC pain crisis, and adverse events was higher in social class 1 patients than in the classes 2, 3, and 4. Also, the age group 5-10 years appeared more susceptible to adverse events and VOC. Our findings suggest the need to conduct future larger studies, to deduce the modifying influence of disparity in SES on certain clinical and hematological indices in children with SCD.",
