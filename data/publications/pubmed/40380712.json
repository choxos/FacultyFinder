  "title": "Improving Independent Living and Quality of Life for Dementia Patients with Open-Interface Sensor-Based Home Monitoring.",
  "abstract": "Living with dementia is a challenging journey for both those with dementia and their families. Besides memory loss and cognitive decline, persons with dementia often face challenges of independent living and loss of quality of life. To enhance and extend the period of independent living, an open-source software and commercial sensor-based home monitoring system is being developed. These sensors are relatively compatible with home environments, can be personalized for different users, and provide constant support including reminders, also allowing for early identification of physical or behavioural changes. They assist not only in managing everyday activities of people with dementia but also provide their carers with peace of mind.",
