  "title": "Is Heel Height Associated with Pain Exacerbations in Hip Osteoarthritis Patients?-Results from a Case-Crossover Study.",
  "abstract": "The etiology of osteoarthritis (OA) pain exacerbations is not well understood. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association of heel height and duration of wearing shoes with higher heels with pain exacerbations in people with hip OA. Eligible participants with symptomatic hip OA were instructed to complete online questionnaires every 10 days over a 90-day follow-up period. They were required to complete the questionnaire whenever they were experiencing hip pain exacerbation. Of 252 participants recruited, 137 (54.4%) contributed both case and control period data, and were included in the analysis. Wearing shoes with a heel height ≥ 2.5 cm during the past 24 h was associated with lower odds of pain exacerbations (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.99). A longer duration (>6 h) of wearing shoes with heel height ≥ 2.5 cm was also associated with a lower risk of hip pain exacerbations (p for linear trend = 0.003). Wearing shoes with heel height ≥ 2.5 cm and longer duration in the past 24 h may be protective against hip pain exacerbations in people with symptomatic hip OA. Given the observational study nature, it would be prudent for this to be replicated in an independent data set.",
