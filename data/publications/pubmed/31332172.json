  "title": "Gram-scale total synthesis of teixobactin promoting binding mode study and discovery of more potent antibiotics.",
  "abstract": "Teixobactin represents a new class of antibiotics with novel structure and excellent activity against Gram-positive pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Herein, we report a one-pot reaction to conveniently construct the key building block L-allo-Enduracidine in 30-gram scale in just one hour and a convergent strategy (3 + 2 + 6) to accomplish a gram-scale total synthesis of teixobactin. Several analogs are described, with 20 and 26 identified as the most efficacious analogs with 3~8-fold and 2~4-fold greater potency against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus respectively in comparison with teixobactin. In addition, they show high efficiency in Streptococcus pneumoniae septicemia mouse model and neutropenic mouse thigh infection model using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. We also propose that the antiparallel Î²-sheet of teixobactin is important for its bioactivity and an antiparallel dimer of teixobactin is the minimal binding unit for lipid II via key amino acids variations and molecular docking.",
