  "title": "Effect of Dietary and Supplemental Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids on Risk of Recurrent Gout Flares.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) consumption (dietary or supplemental) and risk of gout flares. METHODS: We used data from the Boston University Online Gout Study, an internet-based case-crossover study conducted from February 2003 to January 2012. At the times of gout flares (hazard period) and during gout flare-free periods (control periods), participants completed questionnaires regarding exposures, including supplements and diet, during the preceding 48 hours. We examined the relationship of self-reported n-3 PUFA-rich supplements and fish intake with the risk of recurrent gout flares using conditional logistic regression, adjusting for total purine intake, diuretic use, and other urate-lowering or flare prophylactic medications (allopurinol, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or colchicine). RESULTS: Of the 724 participants, 85% met the 1977 American College of Rheumatology preliminary criteria for the classification of the acute arthritis of primary gout. Twenty-two percent of the participants reported some form of n-3 PUFA consumption (supplements, 4.6%; dietary fatty fish, 19%) in the 48 hours preceding a gout flare or flare-free period. The adjusted odds ratios were 1.01 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.63-1.60; P = 0.98) for all 3 supplements combined and 0.74 (95% CI 0.54-0.99; P = 0.04) for consumption of â‰¥2 n-3 PUFA-rich fish servings. CONCLUSION: Dietary n-3 PUFA-rich fish consumption, when adjusted for total purine intake, was associated with lower risk of recurrent gout flares, whereas n-3 PUFA supplementation alone, as taken in a self-directed manner, was not. Consumption of specific sources and adequate doses of n-3 PUFA for gout flare prevention warrants further study in an adequately powered clinical trial.",
