  "title": "Evaluating overweight and obesity prevalence in survivors of childhood brain tumors: a systematic review protocol.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Overweight and obesity are well-known risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases including hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, and type 2 diabetes in the general population. Survivors of childhood brain tumors (SCBT) are at risk of premature mortality, and recent evidence suggests that these cardiometabolic diseases are potential emerging determinants of survival and quality of life. Therefore, the rates of overweight and obesity in this population need to be examined to assess their impact on outcomes. The objective of this systematic review is to examine the prevalence of overweight and obesity in SCBT. The secondary aim of this review is to evaluate whether SCBT have higher adiposity compared to the general population. METHODS: Searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effect. For gray literature, we will search ProQuest Dissertations and Theses A&I and Web of Science. Two reviewers will independently screen all articles against predetermined eligibility criteria and complete data abstraction, risk of bias, and quality assessments. The primary outcome includes the prevalence of overweight or obesity. The secondary outcomes involve waist-to-hip ratio, waist-to-height ratio, body fat percentage, and skinfold thickness. Meta-analysis will be performed when two or more studies with similar design, populations, and outcomes are available. DISCUSSION: This review will summarize current data on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in SCBT. This will help the development of an understanding of the scale of overweight and obesity in this population and guide the design of interventions that will improve outcomes.
