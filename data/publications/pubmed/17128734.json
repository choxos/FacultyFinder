  "title": "Assessing satisfaction with care in long-term care homes: current and best practices.",
  "abstract": "Given the increased call for accountability and quality of care in long-term care, it is important that government and long-term care provider organizations contemplate resident and family satisfaction with long-term care. This article highlights important considerations and provides practical recommendations for conducting satisfaction surveys in long-term care homes in terms of content, method of implementation and analysis, and use of findings. We conclude by recommending three surveys worthy of consideration by the government and long-term care provider organizations in Canada.",
