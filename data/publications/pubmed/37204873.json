  "abstract": "Patients with two congenital heart diseases (CHDs), Ebstein's anomaly (EA) and left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC), suffer higher morbidity than either CHD alone. The genetic etiology and pathogenesis of combined EA/LVNC remain largely unknown. We investigated a familial EA/LVNC case associated with a variant (p.R237C) in the gene encoding Kelch-like protein 26 (KLHL26) by differentiating induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from affected and unaffected family members into cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and assessing iPSC-CM morphology, function, gene expression, and protein abundance. Compared with unaffected iPSC-CMs, CMs containing the KLHL26 (p.R237C) variant exhibited aberrant morphology including distended endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum (ER/SR) and dysmorphic mitochondria and aberrant function that included decreased contractions per minute, altered calcium transients, and increased proliferation. Pathway enrichment analyses based on RNASeq data indicated that the \"structural constituent of muscle\" pathway was suppressed, whereas the \"ER lumen\" pathway was activated. Taken together, these findings suggest that iPSC-CMs containing this KLHL26 (p.R237C) variant develop dysregulated ER/SR, calcium signaling, contractility, and proliferation.NEW & NOTEWORTHY We demonstrate here that iPSCs derived from patients with Ebstein's anomaly and left ventricular noncompaction, when differentiated into cardiomyocytes, display significant structural and functional changes that offer insight into disease pathogenesis, including altered ER/SR and mitochondrial morphology, contractility, and calcium signaling.",
