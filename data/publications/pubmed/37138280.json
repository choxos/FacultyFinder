  "title": "How much the leg length has changed after the MOUKA through measurement of the full length radiographs? Beware of splicing error.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Leg length change after knee arthroplasty is one of the most concerned problems for patients and doctors. However, as there was only one literture focused on the leg length change after unicompartmental knee arthroplasty, we aimed to clarify the leg length change after medial mobile-bearing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (MOUKA) using a novel double calibration method. METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent MOUKA and had taken full-length radiographs in a standing position prior to and at 3 months after the operation. We eliminated the magnification by a calibrator and corrected the longitudinal splicing error by measuring the femur and tibia lengths before and after operation. Perceived leg length change was collected 3 months after operation. Bearing thickness, preoperative joint line convergence angle, preoperative and postoperative varus angles, flexion contracture and Oxford knee score (OKS) were also collected. RESULTS: From June 2021 to February 2022, 87 patients were enrolled.76 (87.4%) of them showed an increase with an average of 0.32 cm (range from -0.30 cm to 1.05 cm) in leg length change. The lengthening was strongly correlated with the degree of varus deformity and its correction value (r = 0.81&0.92, P < 0.01). Only 4 (4.6%) patients perceived leg length lengthening after operation. There was no difference in OKS between the patients who had an increase in leg length and those who had a decrease (P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Majority of patients only experienced a slight increase in leg length after MOUKA, and such an increase did not affect patients' perception and short-term function.",
