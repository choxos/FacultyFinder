  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Fewer than one-third of childhood cancer survivors receive follow-up from an adult provider, and adolescent and young adults (AYAs) from structurally minoritized sociodemographic groups often face health disparities that can impact transition to adult-oriented care. The primary aim of this study was to determine the relation among sociodemographic factors, cumulative effects, and transition beliefs/expectations and goals, and the moderating role of health competence beliefs in AYA survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: A total of 195 AYAs (aged 15-29) reported sociodemographic information, completed the Transition Readiness Inventory assessing positive beliefs/expectations and goals related to transition, and completed the Health Competence Beliefs Inventory assessing health perceptions, healthcare satisfaction, cognitive competence, and autonomy. A cumulative sociodemographic factor variable was computed to investigate the potential additive effects of multiple sociodemographic factors associated with disparities. T-tests, Pearson correlations, and multivariate linear regressions were used. RESULTS: Cumulative sociodemographic factors were not related to transition readiness, and insurance type was the only factor associated with health competence beliefs and transition readiness, such that AYAs with public insurance reported lower healthcare satisfaction, cognitive competence, and transition goals relative to those with private insurance. There were no interaction effects; however, health competence beliefs were significantly associated with transition beliefs/expectations and goals. CONCLUSION: Public insurance is a barrier to holding positive beliefs/expectations and goals about transition, yet other sociodemographic factors associated with risks for poor transfer were not related to transition readiness. Multi-level interventions to reduce disparities and improve transition readiness should target health competence beliefs and barriers created by insurance.",
