  "title": "Clinical effect of successful reperfusion in patients presenting with NIHSS < 6 and large vessel occlusion.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of reperfusion in patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) of the anterior circulation and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)< 6. METHODS: It was a retrospective cohort study. The reperfusion grade was determined using the modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (TICI) score. The modified Rankin Score (mRS) ≤1 were defined as excellent and (mRS) ≤2 as favorable outcome at 3-month. Meanwhile, the all-cause mortality, intracerebral hemorrhage, and complications were recorded. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate outcomes. RESULTS: Seventy-six patients (86.4%) achieved reperfusion (TICI2B/3). Excellent outcome was achieved in 62 (70.5%) and favorable outcome in 69 (78.4%). All-cause death occurred in 2 (2.3%). The rate of excellent outcome in patients with TICI0,1,2A was 41.7%, with TICI2B 69.2%, and with TICI3 78.0% (p < 0.05). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis related to excellent outcome, the OR(95% CI) was 5.68(1.35,23.95) for TICI3; the test for linear trend by entering categorical variables as continuous variables in the adjusted model (p for trend=0.02<0.05), defining TICI0,1,2A as reference. Subgroup analyses showed without intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) (OR, 14.29; 95% CI, 1.76-116.37) and with middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion (OR, 7.97; 95% CI,1.26-50.32), the excellent outcome further improved with TICI3. Findings were similar in favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that successful reperfusion was intensely connected with better functional outcomes for patients with LVO presenting with NIHSS<6 in the anterior circulation, especially MCA occlusion and pretreatment without IVT.",
