  "title": "Improving asthma communication in high-risk children.",
  "abstract": "Few child asthma studies address the specific content and techniques needed to enhance child communication during asthma preventive care visits. This study examined the content of child and parent communications regarding their asthma management during a medical encounter with their primary care provider (PCP). The majority of parents and children required prompting to communicate symptom information to the PCP during the clinic visit. Some high-risk families may require an asthma advocate to ensure that the clinician receives an accurate report of child's asthma severity and asthma control to ensure prescribing of optimal asthma therapy.",
