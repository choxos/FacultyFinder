  "title": "Effects of Extracted Pulse Proteins on Lipid Targets for Cardiovascular Risk Reduction: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many clinical practice guidelines recommend dietary pulses for the prevention and management of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The impact of extracted pulse proteins remains unclear. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of the effect of extracted pulse proteins on therapeutic lipid targets. METHODS AND FINDINGS: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched through April 2024 for trials of â‰¥3-weeks. The primary outcome was low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). The secondary outcomes were other lipid targets. Independent reviewers extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. Subgroup analyses included by pulse type and the certainty of evidence was assessed using GRADE. RESULTS: Seven included trials (14 trial comparisons, n = 453) with a median of 4-weeks duration and dose of 35 g/day showed that extracted pulse proteins decreased LDL-C by -0.23 mmol/L (95% confidence interval: -0.36 to -0.10 mmol/L, p < 0.001). Similar effects were observed for non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. No interactions were found by pulse type. Subgroup analyses revealed effect modification by sex, with greater proportions of females seeing greater reductions. GRADE was generally moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Extracted pulse proteins likely result in moderate reductions in LDL-C and other lipid targets. Future studies on various types of extracted pulse proteins including assessments by sex are warranted.",
