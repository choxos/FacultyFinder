  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis, etiology, and optimal management of fibromyalgia remains contentious. This uncertainty may result in variability in clinical management. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies examining physicians' knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding fibromyalgia. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed from inception to February 2023 for cross-sectional surveys evaluating physicians' attitudes toward, and management of, fibromyalgia. Pairs of independent reviewers conducted article screening, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We used random-effects meta-analysis to pool proportions for items reported by more than one study and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach to summarize the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: Of 864 citations, 21 studies (8904 participants) were eligible for review. Most physicians endorsed fibromyalgia as a distinct clinical entity (84%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 74-92), and half (51%; 95% CI, 40-62) considered fibromyalgia a psychosocial condition. Knowledge of formal diagnostic criteria for fibromyalgia was more likely among rheumatologists (69%, 95% CI, 45-89) versus general practitioners (38%, 95% CI, 24-54) (P = .04). Symptom relief was endorsed as the primary management goal by most physicians (73%, 95% CI, 52-90). Exercise, physiotherapy, antidepressants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and non-opioid analgesics were most endorsed for management of fibromyalgia, but with wide variability between surveys. Opioids and most complementary and alternative interventions (e.g., homeopathy, chiropractic, and massage) received limited endorsement. CONCLUSION: There is moderate certainty evidence to suggest that physicians are divided regarding whether fibromyalgia is a biomedical or psychosocial disorder. Physicians typically prioritize symptom relief as the primary goal of management, and often endorse management with exercise, non-opioid analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, and physiotherapy (moderate to high certainty evidence); however, important practice variation exists.",
