  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Left atrial (LA) strain (ε) and ε rate (SR) analysis by 2-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography is a novel method for functional assessment of the LA. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion by Lariat epicardial ligation on mechanical function of the LA by performing ε and SR analysis before and after the procedure. METHODS: A total of 66 patients who underwent successful LAA exclusion were included in the study. Of these 66 patients, 32 had adequate paired data for ε and SR analysis. SR during ventricular systole (LA-SRs) represents LA reservoir function, and SR during early ventricular diastole (LA-SRe) represents LA conduit function. ε and SR were determined from apical 4- and 2-chamber views using the electrocardiographic QRS as a reference point. LA volume index as surrogate for LA remodeling was measured from apical views. RESULTS: Mean patient age was 70 ± 9.2 years. LAA ligation resulted in improved reservoir function (LA-SRs: pre 0.72, confidence interval [CI] 0.63-0.83 vs post 0.81, CI 0.73-0.98; P = .043) and conduit function (LA-SRe: pre 0.74, CI 0.67-0.99 vs post 0.89, CI 0.82-1.07; P = .025). LA volume index improved significantly with the Lariat (pre 35.4, CI 29.4-37.2 vs post 29.2, CI 28.2-35.9; P <.023). CONCLUSION: LAA exclusion seems to improve mechanical function of the LA and results in reverse LA remodeling.",
