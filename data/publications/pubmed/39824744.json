  "title": "The Canadian Experience With Magnetic Esophageal Anastomosis: A Report From the Canadian Consortium for Research in Pediatric Surgery (CanCORPS).",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Magnetic anastomosis is an innovative technique for establishing esophageal continuity in infants born with esophageal atresia. Few case series featuring this technology have been published, with even fewer reports on complications. We present the entire Canadian experience with this approach. METHODS: A nationwide retrospective review of all esophageal atresia patients treated with magnetic anastomoses in Canada was conducted through the Canadian Consortium for Research in Pediatric Surgery (CanCORPS). RESULTS: Magnetic anastomoses were attempted in nine patients including four Type A, two Type B, and three Type C. The median pre-operative esophageal gap was 2.9 cm (range 0.0-5.5 cm). In four patients, magnetic anastomosis was used as a salvage technique, after failed attempted primary repair. Seven patients (78 %) achieved esophageal patency after magnet insertion. Strictures developed in all successful cases and required a median of 10 dilatations (range 3-16). In one patient with a failed anastomosis, the proximal magnet perforated the proximal esophageal pouch, while in the second case, the magnets failed to couple together. One patient had an anastomosis form but required operative intervention shortly afterwards to both revise the anastomosis and address a missed proximal fistula. CONCLUSION: In the Canadian experience, magnetic anastomosis was successful in establishing esophageal continuity in most patients. However, all patients developed strictures requiring multiple dilatations, and there was a substantial risk of complications requiring additional operative procedures. Further refinement of this technique may establish magnetic anastomosis as another tool for the pediatric surgeon treating long-gap and other challenging cases of esophageal atresia.",
