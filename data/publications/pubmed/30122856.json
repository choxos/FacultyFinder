  "title": "Outcome Analysis of Visual Acuity and Side Effect after Ruthenium-106 Plaque Brachytherapy for Medium-sized Choroidal Melanoma.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to report on treatment outcomes for medium-sized choroidal melanoma treated with Ruthenium-106 (Ru-106) plaque brachytherapy. METHODS: A retrospective case series of 28 patients received Ru-106 brachytherapy treatment for choroidal melanoma. The prescribed tumor dose was 85 Gy to a depth of 5 mm. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 31.2 months. At 12 and 24-month postirradiation, the best corrected visual acuity ≥20/70 (LogMar ≥-0.54) was 53.8% and 64.2%, respectively. Median time to tumor regression was estimated to be 10 months (95% CI = 9-18 months), with 100% of response rate by 32 months. Radiation-induced side effects were limited, and there were no postradiation enucleations. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients maintained good visual acuity, with no enucleations and minimal side effects. In this cohort, the Ru-106 plaque brachytherapy proved to be an efficacious and safe treatment option for patients with medium-sized choroidal melanomas with a maximal tumor height of 5 mm.",
