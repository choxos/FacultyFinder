  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are largely unknown. Several studies have examined the relation of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use to the risk of NHL, with inconsistent results. METHODS: We examined NSAID use among 529 newly diagnosed NHL cases and 2013 controls interviewed from 1977 to 2002 in our Case-Control Surveillance Study. RESULTS: The odds ratio for NHL among subjects whose regular NSAID use began at least one year prior to hospital admission compared to never users was 0.9 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.6-1.3). Odds ratios for less than five years, five to less than 10 years, and 10 or more years of regular use were 1.2 (95% CI: 0.8-1.9), 1.0 (95% CI: 0.5-2.1), and 0.4 (95% CI: 0.1-1.0), respectively. The results were similar for regular aspirin use. CONCLUSION: Our results add to the body of data suggesting that NSAIDs do not increase the risk of NHL and even suggest the possibility of protection by long-term use.",
