  "abstract": "Nurses' perceptions of barriers preventing optimal pain management in older adults on acute medical units and the extent to which they perceived they had adopted four evidence-based practices related to pain assessment and management were often incongruent with actual practice. Eliciting reports of pain, offering pro re nata pain relief regularly, utilizing pain assessment tools in patients with cognitive impairment, redesigning documentation tools and processes, making nonpharmacological alternatives accessible, and helping patients and families manage side effects would target the 12 barriers having the biggest impact.",
