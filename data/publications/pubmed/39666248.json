  "title": "Effects of Situational Loneliness on Mental Health and Sleep Health Outcomes among White Older Adults during the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study examined the cross-sectional and 2-year prospective associations between situational loneliness and health outcomes in older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey that evaluated behaviors (e.g., socialization) and health outcomes at two points (May-June 2020 and October-November 2022) during the pandemic. Logistic regression was used to analyze the cross-sectional associations between situational loneliness and health outcomes (i.e., depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and sleep health) while linear regression was used to examine the prospective associations. RESULTS: In a sample of 428 older adults (age 65â€‰+), situational loneliness was associated with short-term, but not long-term, increases in depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and problems with sleep. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the older adult population demonstrates resilience in the face of short-term increases in loneliness. Thus, promoting resilience may be a promising strategy for mitigating the negative consequences of situational loneliness.",
