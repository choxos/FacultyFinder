  "title": "Targeting p53-p21 signaling to enhance mesenchymal stem cell regenerative potential.",
  "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are properties of self-renewal and differentiation potentials and thus are very appealing to regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, their therapeutic potential is frequently constrained by senescence, limited proliferation, and stress-induced apoptosis. The key role of the p53-p21 biology in MSC biology resides in safeguarding genomic stability while promoting senescence and limiting regenerative capacity upon over-activation demonstrated. This pathway is a key point for improving MSC function and exploiting the inherent limitations. Recent advances indicate that senescence can be delayed by targeting the p53-p21 signaling and improved MSC proliferation and differentiation capacity. PFT-α pharmacological agents transiently inhibit p53 from increasing proliferation and lineage-specific differentiation, while antioxidants such as hydrogen-rich saline and epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) suppress oxidative stress and attenuate p53 p21 signaling. Genetic tools like CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference also precisely modulate TP53 and CDKN1A expression to optimize MSC functionality. The interplay of p53-p21 with pathways like Wnt/β-catenin and MAPK further highlights opportunities for combinatorial therapies to enhance MSC resilience and regenerative outcomes. This review aims to offer a holistic view of how p53-p21 targeting can further the regenerative potential of MSCs, resolving senescence, proliferation, and stress resilience towards advanced therapeutics built on MSCs.",
