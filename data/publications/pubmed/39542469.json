  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Recurrent shoulder dislocations often cause attrition of the labrum and progressive loss of the anterior bony contour of the glenoid. Treatment options for this pathology involve either soft tissue repair or bony augmentation procedure. The optimal management for patients with shoulder instability with subcritical bone loss remains unknown and current clinical practice is highly varied. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Shoulder instability Trial comparing Arthroscopic stabilisation Benefits compared with Latarjet procedure Evaluation (STABLE) is an ongoing multicentre, randomised controlled trial of 114 patients diagnosed with recurrent anterior shoulder instability and subcritical glenoid bone loss (10%-20%, measured on 3D CT using circle of best fit technique). Patients are randomised either arthroscopic capsuloligamentous repair (Bankart repair+remplissage) or open or arthroscopic coracoid transfer (Latarjet procedure). The primary outcome of this trial will be the between-group difference in the change from baseline to 24 months postintervention in Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index scores. Secondary outcomes include: (1) rates of recurrent shoulder dislocations and symptoms of instability up to 24 months' postsurgery; (2) clinical outcomes measured by American Shoulder and Elbow Society score, Shoulder Activity Scale, EQ-5D and Patient Satisfaction Scale; (3) physical examination (range of motion, stability); (4) return to previous level of activity/sport; (5) rate of shoulder-related complications and serious adverse events. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This protocol has been reviewed and approved by the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HiREB; project number 15998) prior to commencement of the trial. Results from the study will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal regardless of whether there are statistically significant findings. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05705479; this study was prospectively registered on clinicaltrials.gov.",
