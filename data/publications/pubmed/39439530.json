  "abstract": "AIMS: This study aimed to compare the effects of the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin with aspirin alone on health-related quality of life in the Cardiovascular Outcomes for People Using Anticoagulation Strategies (COMPASS) trial. METHODS AND RESULTS: Health-related quality of life assessed using the EQ-5D-3L. The treatment effects on health utility and EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS) scores were compared between rivaroxaban plus aspirin and aspirin alone in terms of adjusted mean difference in change from baseline and odds ratio of having deterioration events. Nine thousand forty-nine (98.9%) and 6916 (75.5%) completed the EQ-5D-3L at baseline and at final visit, respectively. Nine thousand twenty-eight (98.9%) and 6887 (76.3%) completed the EQ-5D-3L at baseline and final visit, respectively. Mean (standard deviation) health utility and EQ VAS scores at baseline were 0.871 (0.141) and 76.0 (15.3), respectively, for the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group, compared with 0.873 (0.139) and 75.8 (15.1) for the aspirin group. Adjusted mean difference in change from baseline utility was -0.002 [95% confidence interval (CI), -0.006, 0.002, P = 0.30] between the combination therapy group and the aspirin group. The odds ratio (95% CI) of experiencing deterioration in health utility was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93, 1.10, P = 0.81) between the two groups. Adjusted mean difference in change from baseline EQ VAS was 0.02 (95% CI, -0.43, 0.47, P = 0.93) between the two groups. CONCLUSION: This analysis of the COMPASS trial demonstrated that the quality of life of patients was similar between the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group and the aspirin alone group.
