  "title": "Rosinidin Flavonoid Ameliorates Hyperglycemia, Lipid Pathways and Proinflammatory Cytokines in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.",
  "abstract": "Diabetes is one of the world's most important public health issues, impacting both public health and socioeconomic advancement; moreover, current pharmacotherapy is still insufficient. The natural flavonoid rosinidin has a long history of use in pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements, but its role in diabetes has been unknown. The current study was intended to confirm the anti-diabetic activity of rosinidin in our laboratory setting, along with its mechanism. Streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, ip) treatment used to induce type II diabetes in rats and the test medication rosinidin was then administered orally (at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) for biochemical and histopathological analysis. Treatment with rosinidin reduced negative consequences of diabetes. Rosinidin exerted a protective effect on a number of characteristics, including anti-diabetic responses (lower blood glucose, higher serum insulin and improved pancreatic function) and molecular mechanisms (favorable effects on lipid profiles, total protein, albumin, liver glycogen, proinflammatory cytokine, antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, AST, ALT and urea). Furthermore, the improved pancreatic architecture observed in tissues substantiated the favourable actions of rosinidin in STZ-induced diabetic rats.",
