  "abstract": "Functional dyspepsia remains a major challenge for clinicians with no approved drugs available in the Western World. In October 2016, a meeting was held in Washington, DC, sponsored by the American Gastroenterological Association's Center for Diagnostics and Therapeutics, which included members of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the pharmaceutical industry, experts in FD, and representatives of patient organizations. This white paper summarizes our current status, progress with a validated patient reported outcome instrument in functional dyspepsia, future directions and needs.",
