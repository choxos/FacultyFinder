  "title": "Sonocatalytic degradation of ciprofloxacin using hydrogel beads of TiO2 incorporated biochar and chitosan.",
  "abstract": "Pharmaceuticals are necessary to be removed from environment. Herein TiO2 incorporated biochar made from pyrolysis of agricultural wastes was encapsulated into chitosan to obtain a novel hydrogel beads. This hydrogel beads executed a dual role as both adsorbent and sonocatalyst, which proved to be suitable for the removal of antibiotic ciprofloxacin (CIP) from water. The results showed that adsorption of CIP followed pseudo first order kinetics model and Langmuir adsorption isotherm model, having maximum adsorption at pH 9. Whereas the degradation was more efficient at pH 6 due to greater standard potential for [â€¢]OH/H2O in acidic media. The degradation was maximum at 150 W of ultrasonic power, then decreased in presence of dissimilar electrolytes and even reduced to 0 in presence of Na3PO4. Different quenchers such as benzoquinone (BQ), Triethanolamine (TEA) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) reduced degradation efficiency (DE) and mineralization efficiency (ME). The DE was decreased from 85.23% to 81.50% (BQ), 74.27% (TEA), and 61.77% (IPA) within 25 min. The prepared sonocatalyst was capable of regeneration with DE, remaining sufficiently high (62%) even after four regeneration steps. These results indicate that titanium-biochar/chitosan hydrogel beads (TBCB) are durable and effective for long-term CIP removal.",
