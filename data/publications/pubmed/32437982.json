  "title": "A Roadmap to Reopening a Neurosurgical Practice in the Age of COVID-19.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has left a lasting mark on medicine globally. METHODS: Here we outline the steps that the Lenox Hill Hospital/Northwell Health Neurosurgery Department-located within the epicenter of the pandemic in New York City-is currently taking to recover our neurosurgical efforts in the age of COVID-19. RESULTS: We outline measurable milestones to identify the transition to the recovery period and hope these recommendations may serve as a framework for an effective path forward. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that recovery following the COVID-19 pandemic offers unique opportunities to disrupt and rebuild the historical patient and office experience as we evolve with modern medicine in a post-COVID-19 world.",
