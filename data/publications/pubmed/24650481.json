  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Ulnar polydactylies present with a wide variation in the size and appearance of the affected finger, ranging from small cutaneous appendages to fully formed additional fingers. Since ulnar polydactyly is rarely associated with functional disabilities, psychological and cosmetic reasons are the main rationale for surgical treatment. The aim of this study was to present the appearance, treatment regimen, and outcome of a series of children treated with ulnar polydactylies. METHODS: Data of all pediatric patients treated between 2000 and 2010 were included. For assessing long-term outcome, patients were contacted via mail and asked to complete a questionnaire concerning location and appearance of the scar as well as functional and cosmetic satisfaction (VAS 0-100). RESULTS: In that period, 32 patients (20 male, 12 female) with 53 ulnar polydactylies were treated. In 20 patients the polydactyly occurred bilaterally (63%), in 10 patients on the left side (31%), and 2 patients presented with right-sided ulnar polydactyly (6%). The vast majority of ulnar polydactylies were floating cutaneous appendages. The mean age of the patients at operation was 8.6 months (range 0 to 10 years). 20 patients (63%) responded to the postal questionnaire. Follow-up time was 4.9 years (range 2.1 to 10 years). The majority of patients reported a flat scar (n=18, 90%). Mean overall satisfaction with the postoperative result using a VAS 0-100 score was 89. CONCLUSION: We were able to report a good postoperative outcome of a series of patients suffering from ulnar polydactylies.",
