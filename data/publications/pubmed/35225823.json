  "title": "Identifying patient characteristics associated with potentially redirectable paramedic transported emergency department visits in Ontario, Canada: a population-based cohort study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Paramedic redirection from emergency department (ED) to subacute centres may be more beneficial for some patients, though little is known about which patients are potentially appropriate. We examined whether patient characteristics were associated with ED visits when the main intervention was suitable to be performed in a subacute centre. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study using the National Ambulatory Care Reporting System from 2014 to 2018 in Ontario, Canada. We included all adult patients transported by paramedics and had a main physician intervention recorded. We used results of a RAND/UCLA modified Delphi study to categorise patients into either ED or a subacute care (urgent care and/or general practice centre) based on their main intervention. An independent logistic regression model was analysed for each subacute centre. RESULTS: A total of 2 394 072 ED visits were included; 59% of ED interventions were categorised as 'urgent care', 27% 'ED only', 9% either 'urgent care' or 'general practice' and 5% had an intervention not previously classified. ED visits suitable for 'general practice' had the highest percentage of patients discharged, while 'ED only' had the lowest. Lower medical acuity, younger age, time of triage in evening and overnight, and discharged from ED were independently associated with both subacute centres. 'Urgent care' visits/interventions were associated with an ED main diagnosis of the respiratory system (OR 3.49), while 'general practice' visits were associated with mental health disorders (OR 9.85) and injury/poison/consequences of external causes (OR 3.38). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of ED visits had a main intervention that could have potentially been conducted in a subacute centre. We identified characteristics and diagnostic patterns associated with ED visits when the main intervention was categorised as a subacute centre intervention. This study contributes knowledge to inform which patients are potentially appropriate for paramedic redirection.",
