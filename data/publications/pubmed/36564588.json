  "abstract": "The few studies that compared direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) vs. warfarin in the setting of advanced renal insufficiency have focused on patients with atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this observational, matched, cohort study of patients was to assess the effectiveness and safety of DOAC vs. warfarin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among patients with a creatinine clearance (CrCl) < 30 mL/min. This observational, cohort study included patients with VTE and CrCl < 30 mL/min who were newly initiated on a DOAC or warfarin between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. DOAC patients were matched up to 1:2 to warfarin patients. Primary outcome was a composite of recurrent VTE, clinically-relevant bleeding, ischemic stroke, and all-cause mortality. Adjusted conditional, multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess outcomes. 626 DOAC patients were matched to 1071 warfarin patients. DOAC patients had a higher mean age, higher mean baseline CrCl, and were less likely to have been receiving dialysis. There was no statistically significant difference in the composite outcome between groups (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.87-1.47) or in the individual components of the composite (all HR 95% CI crossed 1.00). Identification of statistically non-significant rates of bleeding and thromboembolic outcomes suggest that the use of DOAC or warfarin is reasonable in patients with VTE and CrCl < 30 mL/min.",
