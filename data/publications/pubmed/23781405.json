  "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study explored self-reported substance use and factors associated with use among adolescents with and without cancer. METHODS: Adolescents (aged 13-19) receiving cancer treatment at a Mid-Atlantic children's hospital (n=103) and healthy peers (n=98) answered questions about substance use (drinking or drug use in past 4 months) and psychosocial variables. Parents completed demographic and family functioning questionnaires. RESULTS: Healthy adolescents reported more substance use (n=17) than adolescents with cancer (n=8). Associates of substance use in adolescents with cancer included more avoidant and substance use-related coping, less positive affect, worse parent-reported family functioning, and less nausea. CONCLUSION: Substance use and its health implications in adolescent oncology need enhanced awareness, intervention and prevention efforts, and further research.",
