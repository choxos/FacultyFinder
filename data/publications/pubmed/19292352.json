  "abstract": "This retrospective study evaluated the correlation of the angulation on initial and healed radiographs of displaced surgical humerus neck fractures treated nonoperatively, with emphasis on the initial axillary view. Thirty-six patients with displaced isolated surgical humerus neck fractures were treated nonoperatively to union. Fracture angulation of the injury and healed views were measured. Angulation on the initial axillary view was a poor predictor of angulation at union. Initial axillary radiographs of surgical neck fractures treated nonoperatively overestimated final angulation, with the Y view being more predictive of angulation at union.",
