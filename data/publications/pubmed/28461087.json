  "abstract": "The ideal rehabilitation regimen of paediatric flexor tendon injuries of the hand is discussed controversially. In this study, the clinical outcome of paediatric patients with flexor tendon injuries treated with a dynamic postoperative protocol was assessed. All children with flexor tendon injuries of the hand who were treated by a dynamic postoperative protocol between 1999 and 2011 were included. Patients were invited for a follow-up examination consisting of clinical examination, the TAM and Buck-Gramcko scores, and the linear measurement system. In total, 144 patients (mean age 9.1 years, range 1-17 years) with 267 flexor tendon injuries (128 flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS), 126 flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) and 13 flexor pollicis longus (FPL)) of 191 digits were treated. Of them, 43% (n = 62; 49 male, 13 female) with 88 digits (thumb n = 4, index finger n = 17, middle finger n = 25, ring finger n = 20, small finger n = 22) with 123 injured tendons (FDS n = 62, FDP n = 57, FPL n = 4) were included in the follow-up at a mean post-operative interval of 7.2 years (range 1-13 years). Using the Total Active Motion (TAM) score, an excellent and good outcome could be achieved in 41% and 48% of the patients, respectively. The zone of injury did not influence the objective outcome measures. Subjective and objective outcomes were not statistically different between young children (â‰¤6 years) and older children (>6 years). The present study demonstrates good to excellent outcome in a large cohort of paediatric patients with flexor tendon injuries of the hand treated with a dynamic mobilisation protocol irrespective of patient age.",
