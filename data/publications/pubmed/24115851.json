  "title": "Synovial chondromatosis of the hand: Three case reports and literature review.",
  "abstract": "Synovial chondromatosis is a rare condition that is probably caused by synovial connective tissue metaplasia. It is very rare in the hand and wrist and because of its low prevalence and nonspecific symptoms, synovial chondromatosis can present diagnostic difficulties for the hand surgeon and may lead to a delay in treatment. We review the literature and report three additional cases of synovial chondromatosis in the hand.",
