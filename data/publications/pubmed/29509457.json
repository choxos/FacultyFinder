  "title": "Comparative Analysis of External Validity Reporting in Non-randomized Intervention Studies.",
  "abstract": "This article describes a comparative analysis of external validity reporting in non-randomized behavioural and public health intervention studies that used and did not use the TREND (Transparent Reporting of Evaluations with Non-randomized Designs) statement. The search resulted in 14 non-randomized intervention studies that were rated based on Green and Glasgow's criteria for external validity reporting. Studies that used the TREND statement demonstrated improved external validity reporting when compared with studies that did not use the TREND statement. The implication is that the TREND statement and Green and Glasgow's criteria can improve external validity reporting of non-randomized behavioural and public health interventions.",
