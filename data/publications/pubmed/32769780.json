  "title": "Evaluation of a Caregiver-Friendly Workplace Program Intervention on the Health of Full-Time Caregiver Employees: A Time Series Analysis of Intervention Effects.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effectiveness of a workplace educational intervention at improving health-related outcomes in carer-employees. METHODS: A pre-post test design compared with health of a sample (n = 21) of carer-employees before (T1) and after (T2) a workplace intervention, as well as a final timepoint (T3) 12 months after T1. An aggregate health score was used to measure health and consisted three scales; depression (CES-D), psychosocial (CRA), and self-reported health (SF-12), where higher scores indicated higher frequency of adverse health symptoms. Three random-slope models were created via the linear mixed modeling method (LMM) to illustrate changes in reported health. RESULTS: All three LMM models reported a reduction in participants' health score, particularly between T1 and T2, indicating a decrease in reported adverse health symptoms. CONCLUSION: The intervention was successful in improving the health of carer-employees.",
