  "title": "Follow Your Heart: Trials and Tribulations of Sir Terence English and the First Successful Heart Transplant in the United Kingdom.",
  "abstract": "The journey of heart transplantation in the United Kingdom (UK) has been marked by challenges and triumphs. Following a series of unsuccessful transplant attempts in 1968, a moratorium was imposed on the procedure. However, in 1979, Sir Terence English broke the national ban, by performing the UK's first successful heart transplant at Papworth Hospital. This achievement opened doors for advancements in heart and lung transplantation and established the Papworth programme as a world leader in the field. Sir Terence's legacy stands as a testament to the transformative power of determination, perseverance and teamwork in overcoming the moratorium, lack of financial support, difficult colleagues and the failure of his first transplant attempt. Through a comprehensive review of the literature, qualitative interviews and Sir Terence's personal contributions, this article provides an account of his trials and tribulations, aiming to inspire and encourage physicians, surgeons and scientists in their pursuit of innovation in the field of medicine.",
