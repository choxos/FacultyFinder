  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the association between psychological factors and pain exacerbations in people with hip OA. METHODS: Eligible participants with symptomatic hip OA were instructed to complete online questionnaires every 10 days over a 90-day follow-up period. In addition, they were required to complete the questionnaire whenever they perceived they were experiencing a hip pain exacerbation. Hip pain exacerbation was defined as an increase of 2 points in pain intensity compared with baseline on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0-10). The Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items, Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, Pain Catastrophizing Scale and Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire were used to evaluate psychological factors. The associations of these with risk of hip pain exacerbation were examined by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 252 participants recruited, 131 (52.0%) contributed both case and control period data and were included in the analysis. A significant association was found between Pain Catastrophizing Scale overall score (1 point increase) with hip pain exacerbations (odds ratio: 1.07, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.11). An increase of a minimal important change (5.5 points) of Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire score was associated with a lower odds of pain exacerbations (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.85). No significant associations were found between Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items or Positive and Negative Affect Schedule scores with hip pain exacerbations. CONCLUSION: Both pain catastrophizing and pain self-efficacy beliefs were associated with pain exacerbations in people with hip OA, but other psychological factors including depression, anxiety and stress or positive and negative affects, were not associated with pain exacerbations.",
