  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a public health issue with significant impact on health care. Antibiogram development and deployment is a key strategy for managing and preventing AMR. Our objective was to develop an Ontario antibiogram as part of a larger provincial initiative aimed at advancing antimicrobial stewardship in the province. METHODS: As part of a voluntary provincial online survey, antibiogram data from 100 of 201 (49.8%) Ontario hospitals were collected and included. All hospitals in Ontario were eligible to participate except those providing only mental health or ambulatory services. Weighted provincial and regional antibiotic susceptibilities (percentages) were conducted using descriptive statistical analyses, and an interactive antibiogram spreadsheet was developed. Respondent-identified barriers to collecting and interpreting antibiogram data are presented descriptively. RESULTS: There was wide regional variability in antimicrobial-resistant organisms across Ontario. Provincial methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus prevalence was 24.6%, ranging from 5.9% to 43.7% regionally. Provincial Escherichia coli resistance to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was 13.8% (regional range 6.0%-25.1%) and 22.5% (regional range 9.8-37.8%), respectively. Klebsiella spp resistance to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin was similar across all health regions, with overall provincial rates of 7.5% and 5.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that integrating hospital AMR tracking and reporting as part of a larger voluntary provincial antimicrobial stewardship program initiative is a feasible approach to capturing AMR data. The provincial antibiogram serves as a benchmark for the current state of AMR provincially and across health regions.",
