  "title": "Towards the Identification of Hemodynamic Parameters Involved in Arteriovenous Fistula Maturation and Failure: A Review.",
  "abstract": "Native arteriovenous fistulas have a high failure rate mainly due to the lack of maturation and uncontrolled neo-intimal hyperplasia development. Newly established hemodynamics is thought to be central in driving the fistula fate, after surgical creation. To investigate the effects of realistic wall shear stress stimuli on endothelial cells, an in vitro approach is necessary in order to reduce the complexity of the in vivo environment. After a systematic review, realistic WSS waveforms were selected and analysed in terms of magnitude, temporal gradient, presence of reversing phases (oscillatory shear index, OSI) and frequency content (hemodynamics index, HI). The effects induced by these waveforms in cellular cultures were also considered, together with the materials and methods used to cultivate and expose cells to WSS stimuli. The results show a wide heterogeneity of experimental approaches and WSS waveform features that prevent a complete understanding of the mechanisms that regulate mechanotransduction. Furthermore, the hemodynamics derived from the carotid bifurcation is the most investigated (in vitro), while the AVF scenario remains poorly addressed. In conclusion, standardisation of the materials and methods employed, as well as the decomposition of realistic WSS profiles, are required for a better understanding of the hemodynamic effects on AVF outcomes. This standardisation may also lead to a new classification of WSS features according to the risk associated with vascular dysfunction.",
