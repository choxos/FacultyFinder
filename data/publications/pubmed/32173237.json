  "title": "Regional Variation and Temporal Trends in Surgery for Pelvic Organ Prolapse in Canada, 2004-2014.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We sought to examine temporal trends in pelvic organ prolapse (POP) surgery in Canada. METHODS: In this observational cross-sectional study, we used diagnostic and procedure codes from all hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits in Canada (excluding Québec) from 2004 to 2014 to identify and analyze data on POP surgery. RESULTS: There were 204 301 POP surgery visits from 2004 to 2014, and the rate of POP surgery declined from 19.3 to 16.0 per 10 000 women during this period. The rates of \"native tissue reconstructive repair\" and \"hysterectomy without other procedure\" declined from 15.0 to 12.8 per 10 000 women and 2.6 to 1.6 per 10 000 women, respectively. The rate of obliteration increased from 0.1 to 0.3 per 10 000 women (all P values for trend <0.01). Mesh procedures increased from 1.6 per 10 000 women in 2004 to 2.4 per 10 000 women in 2007 and 2008, and then declined to 1.3 per 10 000 women in 2014. Reconstructive mesh surgery using an abdominal open approach declined, while laparoscopic procedures increased over the period examined. CONCLUSION: The rates of POP surgery declined in Canada between 2004 and 2014. An increase was observed in obliteration procedures and in laparoscopic vaginal suspension and fixation with mesh.",
