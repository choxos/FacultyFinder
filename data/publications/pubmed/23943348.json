  "title": "Intimate partner violence and HIV: a review.",
  "abstract": "Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a common and negative social determinant of health. IPV also increases vulnerability to risks associated with HIV transmission and contributes to HIV transmission. IPV is therefore predictably common among people living with HIV. It is increasingly being recognized as an important predictor of poor outcomes for those living with HIV by affecting retention to care, mental health, adherence to therapy, frequency of follow-up; all of which lead to more hospitalizations and progression to AIDS. HIV care providers can safely and effectively screen all HIV patients for IPV. Screening offers the opportunity to identify those at risk for poor outcomes and mitigate its effects. Further research is required in further defining the risk factors and outcomes of IPV and optimizing interventions. We review the association between HIV infection and IPV and make recommendations for IPV screening of HIV-positive individuals and those at high risk for HIV.",
