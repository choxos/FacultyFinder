  "title": "Canadian Network and Centre for Trials Internationally (CANNeCTIN): a national network for Canadian-led trials in cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus.",
  "abstract": "The Canadian Network and Centre for Trials INternationally (CANNeCTIN) was jointly funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canadian Foundation for Innovation in April 2008 to provide infrastructure for clinical studies of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. Its functional components include a national coordinating centre at the Population Health Research Institute (PHRI) in Hamilton (Ontario), a collaborative Canadian network and an affiliated international network of hospitals and clinics. The rationales for CANNeCTIN include the global health burden of cardiovascular diseases and diabetes, the strengths of randomized controlled trials - particularly large, multicentre and international - and the track record of success of the PHRI. CANNeCTIN will provide investigators from across Canada with opportunities to become the principal investigators of national and international trials coordinated by the PHRI. CANNeCTIN will support priority pilot studies, and successful investigators will be encouraged and assisted to apply for peer review and industrial funding for full studies to be conducted within the network and coordinated by the PHRI. An extensive education program offers hands-on experience in organizing and leading large national‚ÅÑinternational clinical trials led by accomplished researchers, distance learning courses in clinical research methodology, biostatistics and study coordination, and 'cutting-edge' workshops. A knowledge translation program seeks opportunities arising from clinical trials and encourages research into this paradigm for understanding how best to close the gaps between knowledge and effective practice. The five-year goals are to enhance the capacity of Canadian investigators to lead major clinical studies, facilitate knowledge translation and exchange, and augment Canada's capacity to train the next generation of leaders in cardiovascular and diabetes clinical research.",
