  "abstract": "Interferon-beta (IFN-beta) is a multifunctional cytokine with immunomodulatory properties. We examined the effect of IFN-beta in three separate rat models of glomerular injury and in cultured human glomerular endothelial cells and podocytes. In nephrotoxic nephritis in WKY rats, recombinant rat IFN-beta started either at induction or after establishment of disease significantly reduced 24-h proteinuria by up to 73% and 51%, respectively, but did not affect serum creatinine. There was a slight reduction in numbers of glomerular macrophages, but no difference in glomerular or tubulointerstitial scarring. In Thy-1 nephritis in Lewis rats, IFN-beta started at induction of disease reduced proteinuria by up to 66% with no effect on numbers of glomerular macrophages, but a reduced number of proliferating cells. In puromycin nephropathy in Wistar rats, IFN-beta started at induction of disease reduced proteinuria by up to 93%, but had no effect on glomerular histology. In cultured cells, human IFN-beta-1a had a dramatic effect on barrier properties, increasing electrical resistance across monolayers of either glomerular endothelial cells or podocytes and decreasing trans-monolayer passage of albumin. In conclusion, these results show that IFN-beta reduces proteinuria in three different rat models of glomerular injury and that its anti-proteinuric action may result from direct effects on cells that comprise the glomerular filtration barrier. These data indicate that IFN-beta may have potential as a therapeutic agent in proteinuric renal disease.",
