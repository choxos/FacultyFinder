  "title": "Retrograde autologous priming in cardiac surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Guidelines recommend retrograde autologous priming (RAP) of the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. However, the efficacy and safety of RAP is not well-established. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effects of RAP on transfusion requirements, morbidity and mortality. METHODS: We searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, ScienceDirect, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing RAP to no-RAP. We performed title and abstract review, full-text screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs (n = 1206) and 17 observational studies (n = 3565) were included. Fewer patients required blood transfusions with RAP [RCTs; risk ratio 0.58 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51, 0.65], P < 0.001, and observational studies; risk ratio 0.65 [95% CI: 0.53, 0.80], P < 0.001]. The number of units transfused per patient was also lower among patients who underwent RAP (RCTs; mean difference -0.38 unit [95% CI: -0.72, -0.04], P = 0.03, and observational studies; mean difference -1.03 unit [95% CI: -1.76, -0.29], P < 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis supports the use of RAP as a blood conservation strategy since its use during cardiopulmonary bypass appears to reduce transfusion requirements.",
