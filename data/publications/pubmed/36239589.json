  "title": "Research Priorities Among Canadian Military Veterans Living With Chronic Pain: A Cross-Sectional Survey.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is a debilitating problem that disproportionately affects military veterans. We completed a qualitative study that identified 20 research priorities of Canadian veterans living with chronic noncancer pain. The aim of this study was to establish the generalizability of these priorities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January to March 2021, we emailed a 45-item survey to a list of Canadian veterans living with chronic noncancer pain that asked about the relative importance of 20 research priorities. RESULTS: Overall, 313 of 701 Canadian military veterans living with chronic noncancer pain returned a completed survey (45% response rate). All 20 research priorities listed in the survey were endorsed by ≥75% of respondents, and four received ≥95% endorsement: (1) optimizing chronic pain management after release from the military; (2) establishing the effectiveness of self-care; and (3) identifying and (4) treating mental illness among veterans living with chronic pain. One research priority differed significantly by gender; 50% more females than males rated improving chronic pain care while in the military as important (99% vs. 49%, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our survey established research priorities among Canadian veterans living with chronic noncancer pain. These findings should be considered by granting agencies when formulating calls for proposals and by researchers who wish to undertake research that will address the needs of military veterans living with chronic pain.",
