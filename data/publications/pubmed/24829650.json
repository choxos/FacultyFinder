  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Liver transplantation (LT) is now performed as a cure for numerous untreatable pediatric liver diseases. Quality of life (QoL) can be affected in pediatric patients with LT. Many factors are responsible for lower scores of QoL. This article aims to detail QoL in liver recipients six months following LT in children. METHODS: WE ASSESSED QOLWITH THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONNAIRES: Child Health Quality-Parent Form 50 (CHQ-PF 50)for parents and Child Health Quality-Child Form 87 (CHQ-CF 87) for children â‰¥10 years of age in 50 children with LT and their parents. RESULTS: According to the CHQ-PF 50 questionnaire, QoL was found to be significantly lower in LT children compared with healthy children. According to the CHQ-CF 87 questionnaire, QoL was similar in pediatric liver recipients and the normal population. CONCLUSION: According to parents' judgments, childhood liver recipients have impaired QoL. This may be due to multiple factors that include concern about the long term outcome of LT, comparing their child with other children, and complications of LT. On the other hand, older children and adolescents believe their QoL is similar to healthy children. It seems that by decreasing risk factors, we can reduce stress on families and improve QoL.",
