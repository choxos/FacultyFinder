  "title": "A government policy on full-time nursing employment in Ontario, Canada: An evaluation.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the impact of a government full-time employment policy targeting new graduate nurses in the province of Ontario, Canada, by comparing participants with non-participants. METHODS: The Policy Impact on Nurse Employment (PINEP) survey was administered in 2014 to nurses who graduated between 2007 and 2012. Backward multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the effect of participation in the policy on key outcomes: full-time employment, retention and perceptions of clinical proficiency. RESULTS: A total of 2369 nurses responded to the survey. Policy participants were 1.5 times more likely to be employed full-time and 2.3 times more likely to be retained in their initial position at the time of survey compared to non-participants. Participants also perceived their clinical proficiency to be higher. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence is converging around the importance of providing full-time employment to nurses to sustain the workforce, increase clinical proficiency and improve patient outcomes. In Ontario, the government created a policy to stimulate full-time employment for nurses. Results demonstrate that nursing employment has become more stable. Yet more needs to be done particularly in relation to the precarious employment trend.",
