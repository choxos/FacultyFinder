  "title": "Multiplex measurement of seven tumor markers using an electrochemical protein chip.",
  "abstract": "An electrochemical immunosensor for performing multianalyte measurements of tumor markers is described. The sensor consisted of an array of immunosensing electrodes fabricated on a glass substrate. Each electrode contained a different immobilized antigen and was capable of measuring a specific tumor marker using electrochemical enzyme-based competitive immunoassay. Using this arrangement, multiple analytes could be measured simultaneously by performing the technical operations for a single assay. The biosensor was used to measure the concentrations of seven important tumor markers: AFP, ferritin, CEA, hCG-beta, CA 15-3, CA 125, and CA 19-9. The sensor had excellent precision and accuracy and was comparable in performance to single-analyte ELISAs (1.9-8.1% interassay CV; <2 ng/mL (or units/mL) detection limit for most analytes). Multianalyte assays provide significant advantages over single-analyte tests in terms of cost per test, labor, test throughput, and convenience. We anticipate that chip-based sensors, as described herein, will be suitable for the mass production of economical, miniaturized lab-on-a-chip devices that will have applications in a wide range of clinical, environmental, and biodefense applications.",
