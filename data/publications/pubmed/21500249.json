  "abstract": "Some new 2-(2-(4(4-substitutedbenzoyl-2-methylphenoxy)acetyl)-N-(2-substitutedphenyl) hydrazinecarbothioamides (4a-4j) and (4-((5-(2-substitutedphenylamino)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)methoxy)-3-substitutedphenyl)(phenyl)methanones (5a-5j) have been synthesized from 2-(4-(3-substitutedbenzoyl)-2-methylphenoxy)acetohydrazides (3a, 3b). These newly synthesized compounds (4a-4j and 5a-5j) were characterized by elemental and spectral (IR, (1)H-NMR and MS) analysis. All the synthesized compounds have been screened for their antibacterial activity against both types of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria. The most potent antibacterial compound of this series was compound 5i which has the low MIC 3.75-0.9375 µg/mL value. Both minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and inhibition zones were determined in order to monitor the efficacy of the synthesized compounds. Certain compounds inhibit bacterial growth with low MIC (µg/mL) value.",
