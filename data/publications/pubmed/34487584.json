  "title": "T cell-mediated autoimmunity in immune thrombocytopenia.",
  "abstract": "Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. In addition to anti-platelet autoantibodies, CD8[+] T cells have been implicated as a mechanism of platelet destruction. The current evidence for the existence of platelet-specific CD8[+] T cells in ITP is inconclusive. The purpose of this review is to summarize the studies that investigated CD8[+] T cells in ITP and to review the methods that have been used to detect autoreactive CD8[+] T cells in other autoimmune diseases.",
