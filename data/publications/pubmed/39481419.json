  "title": "Review of the WHO guideline on preventive chemotherapy for public health control of strongyloidiasis.",
  "abstract": "Strongyloidiasis is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis that is estimated to affect 300-600 million people across Asia, Africa, South and central America, and the Pacific. This neglected parasitic disease is most known for its ability to persist as a lifelong infection due to autoinfection and its risk of hyperinfection and disseminated disease during immunosuppression, which has a more than 60% case fatality. Despite the large global burden of strongyloidiasis, there have been no large-scale public health programmes or WHO guidelines directed towards its control and elimination. However, over the past decade, key scientific and policy changes along with requests from endemic countries have led to WHO incorporating strongyloidiasis into its 2021-30 roadmap and public health targets for control and elimination of neglected tropical diseases. In 2024, WHO published its first guideline on public health control of strongyloidiasis with a single recommendation: in endemic settings with a Strongyloides stercoralis infection prevalence of 5% or higher (measured either with Baermann or agar plate culture from stool specimens), WHO conditionally recommends mass drug administration with single-dose ivermectin (200 μg/kg; oral therapy) in all age groups from 5 years and older to reduce strongyloidiasis. This Review, written by the 2023-24 strongyloidiasis guidelines development group along with WHO colleagues and international experts, presents a summary of the recently published WHO guideline recommendation for strongyloidiasis, and the supporting evidence, considerations for public health implementation, and future research needs.",
