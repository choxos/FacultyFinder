  "title": "A Case of Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection Complicated by Free Wall Rupture.",
  "abstract": "Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is an unusual and underdiagnosed cause of nonatherosclerotic acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients might present in various ways including chest pain, ST-elevation ACS, ventricular arrhythmia, and sudden cardiac death. In a few reports, it manifested initially as cardiac tamponade. The association of SCAD with free wall rupture is extremely rare. We present a unique case of a 70-year-old woman who initially presented with non-ST elevation ACS and was found to have SCAD on angiography, which was subsequently complicated by cardiac tamponade with free wall rupture.",
