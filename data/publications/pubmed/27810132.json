  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study compared 5-year breast cancer (BC) recurrence rates in patients randomized to radioguided seed localization (RSL) or wire localization (WL) for non-palpable BC undergoing breast conserving surgery. METHODS: Chart review of follow-up visits and surveillance imaging was conducted. Data collected included patient and tumour factors, adjuvant therapies and BC recurrence (local recurrence (LR), regional recurrence (RR), and distant metastasis (DM)). Univariate analysis was used. RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 298 patients (98%) and median follow-up time was 65 months. There were 11 (4%) cases of BC recurrence and median time to recurrence was 26 months. LR occurred in 8 patients (6 WL and 2 RSL; p = 0.28). Positive margins at first surgery (p = 0.024) and final surgery (p = 0.004) predicted for BC recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: There was no detectable difference in BC recurrence between WL and RSL groups and positive margins at initial or final surgery both predicted for BC recurrence.",
