  "title": "Capsaicin Protects Against Oxidative Insults and Alleviates Behavioral Deficits in Rats with 6-OHDA-Induced Parkinson's Disease via Activation of TRPV1.",
  "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that capsaicin may play a role in modulating neuronal function and controlling motor behavior. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear and the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) might be involved in. This study investigated the potential neuroprotective role of capsaicin in a rat model of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced Parkinson's disease (PD). Capsaicin was treated intraperitoneally for the 6-OHDA induced PD rats and the locomotor activity and abnormal involuntary movements were found alleviated. Besides, brain oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, superoxide dismutase and catalase) was also assessed, and oxidative insults were investigated relieved. Both the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase and TRPV1 were increased in the striatal and substantia nigra areas of 6-OHDA induced rats after the treatment of capsaicin by the semi-quantitative analysis of Western Blot. And the immunostaining of substantia nigra further suggested that capsaicin might protect against dopaminergic neuronal loss. Our results showed that TRPV1 might be a novel therapeutic target for PD.",
