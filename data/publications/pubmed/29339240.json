  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the relationship between hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and the existing data show conflicting results. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of T2DM among patients with HS and identify at-risk demographic subgroups. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis identifying T2DM among patients with and without HS from a demographically heterogeneous population-based sample of more than 50 million patients in the United States. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of T2DM among patients with HS was 24.8% (10,705 of 43,105) compared with 15.6% (1,993,320 of 12,527,570) among patients without HS. The prevalence was highest among patients with HS who were male (3045 of 10,785 [28.2%]), older (1945 of 3950 [49.2%]), nonwhite (4665 of 17,495 [26.7%]), obese (9065 of 30,855 [29.4%]), tobacco smokers (6880 of 25,005 [27.5%]), hypertensive (8595 of 19,610 [43.8%]), and hyperlipidemic (7965 of 17,190 [46.3%]). In univariable and multivariable analyses, patients with HS had 1.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.71-1.79) and 1.58 (95% CI, 1.54-1.62) times the odds, respectively, of having T2DM. HS was associated with T2DM across all demographic subgroups. The association was stronger for younger patients (an OR of 1.67 and 95% CI of 1.60-1.72 for ages 18-44 years vs an OR of 1.50 and 95% CI of 1.41-1.61 for ages ≥65 years). LIMITATIONS: We lacked information on HS disease severity. CONCLUSION: Patients with HS with risk factors, signs, or symptoms of T2DM should be screened.",
