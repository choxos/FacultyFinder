  "title": "Effect of an Online Mobility Self-Management Program on Walking Speed in Older Adults With Preclinical Mobility Limitation: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Walking difficulties are a common and costly problem. However, disability associated with the decline in walking ability is not an inevitable consequence. With an aging population, it is increasingly important to establish strategies to help older adults preserve the capacity to live independently and function well in late life. Preclinical mobility limitation (PCML), which is characterized by subtle changes or limitations in mobility that precede disability, manifests as changes in how daily tasks such as walking are performed. Persons with PCML are at increased risk for the onset of disability and chronic disease. For that reason, PCML is a critical stage in the natural history of functional change when there is the opportunity for primary prevention interventions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of a 12-week online mobility self-management program (Stepping Up) on mobility outcomes, including walking speed, aerobic exercise capacity, dual-task cost, physical functioning (balance and strength), balance confidence, extent of community mobility, self-management of mobility, and quality of life in older adults with PCML. METHODS: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) will recruit 249 older adults (aged 55-75 years) screened for PCML. Participants will be assigned to the Stepping Up program, a telephone-based coaching walking program or an online chair-based yoga program. Programs will be delivered over 12 weeks and participants will undergo virtual assessments with a blinded physiotherapist at baseline, 12, 24, and 36 weeks. An economic evaluation will be conducted alongside this RCT. RESULTS: A total of 253 participants were enrolled in the trial. Data collection commenced in August 2021 and will be completed in October 2025. Data analysis will begin in November 2025 and results will be published in the Summer of 2026. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, PCML has not been addressed by primary prevention interventions that incorporate both task-oriented motor learning exercise and mobility self-management sessions. Results will establish if the Stepping-Up program has the potential to serve as a model for sustainable, accessible, and cost-effective programming for individuals with early mobility limitations.
