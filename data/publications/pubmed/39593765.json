  "title": "Automated Cough Analysis with Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network.",
  "abstract": "Chronic cough is associated with several respiratory diseases and is a significant burden on physical, social, and psychological health. Non-invasive, real-time, continuous, and quantitative monitoring tools are highly desired to assess cough severity, the effectiveness of treatment, and monitor disease progression in clinical practice and research. There are currently limited tools to quantitatively measure spontaneous coughs in daily living settings in clinical trials and in clinical practice. In this study, we developed a machine learning model for the detection and classification of cough sounds. Mel spectrograms are utilized as a key feature representation to capture the temporal and spectral characteristics of coughs. We applied this approach to automate cough analysis using 300 h of audio recordings from cough challenge clinical studies conducted in a clinical lab setting. A number of machine learning algorithms were studied and compared, including decision tree, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, random forest, and neural network. We identified that for this dataset, the CRNN approach is the most effective method, reaching 98% accuracy in identifying individual coughs from the audio data. These findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of various algorithms, highlighting the potential of CRNNs in analyzing complex cough patterns. This research demonstrates the potential of neural network models in fully automated cough monitoring. The approach requires validation in detecting spontaneous coughs in patients with refractory chronic cough in a real-life setting.",
