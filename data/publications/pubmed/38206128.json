  "title": "Enhancing Nutrition Support for Esophageal Cancer Patients: Understanding Factors Influencing Feeding Tube Utilization.",
  "abstract": "Objective: We sought to identify factors that can predict esophageal cancer (EC) patients at high risk of requiring feeding tube insertion. Methods: A retrospective cohort review was conducted, including all patients diagnosed with EC at our cancer center from 2013 to 2018. Multivariate logistic regression was performed comparing the group that required a reactive feeding tube insertion to those who did not require any feeding tube insertion to identify risk factors. Results: A total of 350 patients were included in the study, and 132/350 (38%) patients received a feeding tube. 50 out of 132 (38%) patients had feeding tube inserted reactively. Severe dysphagia (OR 19.9, p < 0.001) at diagnosis and decision to undergo chemotherapy (OR 2.8, p = 0.008) appeared to be predictors for reactive feeding tube insertion. The reactive insertion group had a 7% higher rate of complications relating to feeding tube. Conclusion: Severe dysphagia at diagnosis and undergoing chemotherapy were identified as risk factors for requiring a feeding tube. Ultimately, the aim is to create a predictive tool that utilizes these risks factors to accurate identify high-risk patients who may benefit from prophylactic feeding tube insertion.",
