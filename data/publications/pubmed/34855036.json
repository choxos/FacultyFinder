  "title": "Effectiveness of SharpSense™ algorithms in reducing bradycardia and pause detection: real-world performance in Confirm Rx™ insertable cardiac monitor.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: SharpSense™ technology is an upgradable software enhancement introduced to the Abbott Confirm Rx™ insertable cardiac monitor (ICM). This study aims to characterize the real-world performance of SharpSense algorithms by comparing device detected pause and bradycardia episodes before and after the SharpSense upgrade. METHODS: Confirm Rx devices with at least 90 days monitoring each before and after SharpSense upgrade were included in the study. Bradycardia and pause detections and subcutaneous electrocardiograms (SECGs) within 90 days before and after the upgrade were extracted from Merlin.net™ patient care network for evaluation and adjudicated by expert adjudicators. RESULTS: A total of 197 devices were included in the analysis. Devices were implanted for syncope (35.0%), atrial fibrillation (32.5%), cryptogenic stroke (16.8%), and other indications including palpitations (15.7%). The SharpSense upgrade significantly reduced the number of bradycardia detections by 86.8% and pause detections by 93.1%. In adjudicated SECGs, the upgrade significantly reduced false positive (FP) bradycardia episodes by 91.5% and FP pause episodes by 82.8%. The percentage of devices with at least one FP episode was reduced from 39 to 20% for bradycardia and from 52 to 35% for pause. The number of devices with FP rate greater than 1 episode per week was reduced from 23 to 8% for bradycardia and from 39 to 20% for pause. CONCLUSIONS: In this real-world performance evaluation, the algorithms incorporated in SharpSense software upgrade in Confirm Rx ICMs substantially reduced false positive bradycardia and pause detections and the number of transmitted SECGs for clinic review.",
