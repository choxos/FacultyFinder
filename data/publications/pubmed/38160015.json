  "title": "Systemic corticosteroids in fibrotic lung disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess the available evidence for corticosteroids in fibrotic interstitial lung disease (fILD) to inform the randomised embedded multifactorial adaptive platform ILD. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched Embase, Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL and Web of Science databases from inception to April 17 2023. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: We included studies that compared corticosteroids with standard care, placebo or no treatment in adult patients with fILD. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: We report on the change in forced vital capacity (FVC) and mortality. We used random-effects meta-analysis to estimate relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and standardised MDs for continuous outcomes, with 95% CIs. RESULTS: Of the 13 229 unique citations identified, we included 10 observational studies comprising 1639 patients. Corticosteroids had an uncertain effect on mortality compared with no treatment (RR 1.03 (95% CI 0.85 to 1.25); very low certainty evidence). The effect of corticosteroids on the rate of decline in FVC (% predicted) was uncertain when compared with no treatment (MD 4.29% (95% CI -8.26% to 16.83%); very low certainty evidence). However, corticosteroids might reduce the rate of decline in FVC in patients with non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) fILD (MD 10.89% (95% CI 5.25% to 16.53%); low certainty evidence), while an uncertain effect was observed in patients with IPF (MD -3.80% (95% CI -8.94% to 1.34%); very low certainty evidence). CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence on the efficacy and safety of corticosteroids in fILD is limited and of low certainty. Randomised trials are needed to address this significant research gap.",
