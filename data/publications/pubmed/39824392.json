  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Screening for, and treating, Helicobacter pylori in the general population or patients with early gastric neoplasia could reduce incidence of, and mortality from, gastric cancer. We updated a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining this issue. METHODS: We searched the literature through October 4, 2024, identifying studies examining effect of eradication therapy on incidence of gastric cancer in H pylori-positive adults without gastric neoplasia at baseline or H pylori-positive patients with gastric neoplasia undergoing endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in either RCTs or observational studies. The control arm received placebo or no eradication therapy in RCTs and no eradication therapy in observational studies. Follow-up was â‰¥2 years. We estimated relative risks (RR) of gastric cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS: Eleven RCTs and 13 observational studies were eligible. For RCTs, RR of gastric cancer was lower with eradication therapy in healthy H pylori-positive individuals (8 RCTs, 0.64; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.84) and H pylori-positive patients with gastric neoplasia undergoing EMR (3 RCTs, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.71). RR of death from gastric cancer was lower with eradication therapy in healthy H pylori-positive individuals (5 RCTs, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.62-0.98). In observational studies, RR of future gastric cancer was lower with eradication therapy in H pylori-positive subjects without gastric neoplasia at baseline (11 studies, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.43-0.73) and H pylori-positive patients with gastric neoplasia undergoing EMR (2 studies, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.61). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis provides further evidence that administering eradication therapy prevents gastric cancer in H pylori-positive individuals, with consistency in results among studies of different design.",
