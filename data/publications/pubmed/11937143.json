  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report a case of severe von Willebrand's disease treated with in vitro fertilization using donor oocytes. DESIGN: Case report and literature review. SETTING: Private practice infertility center. PATIENT(S): Infertility patient with recurrent massive hemoperitoneum following spontaneous and induced ovulation. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization using donor oocytes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Successful term delivery. RESULTS(S): Delivery of healthy term singleton infant without maternal complication. CONCLUSION(S): The indications for in vitro fertilization using donor oocytes, while primarily for patients with medical/surgical menopause or genetic disorders, can be expanded to patients with contraindications for spontaneous or induced ovulation.",
