  "title": "The rat-based neurovirulence safety test for the assessment of mumps virus neurovirulence in humans: an international collaborative study.",
  "abstract": "Because of the highly neurotropic and neurovirulent properties of wild-type mumps viruses, most national regulatory organizations require neurovirulence testing of virus seeds used in the production of mumps vaccines. Such testing has historically been performed in monkeys; however, some data suggest that testing in monkeys does not necessarily discriminate among the relative neurovirulent risks of mumps virus strains. To address this problem, a collaborative study was initiated by the National Institute for Biological Standards and Control in the United Kingdom and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States, to test a novel rat-based mumps virus neurovirulence safety test. Results indicate that the assay correctly assesses the neurovirulence potential of mumps viruses in humans and is robust and reproducible.",
