  "title": "Antibiotic Selection and Duration for Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection in Non-Hospitalized Older Adults: A Population-Based Cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We sought to evaluate the impact of antibiotic selection and duration of therapy on treatment failure in older adults with catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI). METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study comparing antibiotic treatment options and duration of therapy for non-hospitalized adults aged 66 and older with presumed CA-UTI (defined as an antibiotic prescription and an organism identified in urine culture in a patient with urinary catheterization documented within the prior 90 d). The primary outcome was treatment failure, a composite of repeat urinary antibiotic prescribing, positive blood culture with the same organism, all-cause hospitalization or mortality, within 60 days. We determined the risk of treatment failure accounting for age, sex, comorbidities, and healthcare exposure using log-binomial regression. RESULTS: Of 4,436 CA-UTI patients, 2,709 (61.1%) experienced treatment failure. Compared to a reference of TMP-SMX (61.9% failure), of those treated with fluoroquinolones, 56.3% experienced failure (RR 0.91, 95% CI: 0.85-0.98) and 60.9% of patients treated with nitrofurantoin experienced failure (RR 1.02, 95% CI: 0.94-1.10). Compared to 5-7 days of therapy (treatment failure: 59.4%), 1-4 days was associated with 69.5% failure (RR 1.15, 95% CI: 1.05-1.27), and 8-14 days was associated with a 62.0% failure (RR 1.05, 95% CI: 0.99-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: Although most treatment options for CA-UTI have a similar risk of treatment failure, fluoroquinolones, and treatment durations â‰¥ 5 days in duration appear to be associated with modestly improved clinical outcomes. From a duration of therapy perspective, this study provides reassurance that relatively short courses of 5-7 days may be reasonable for CA-UTI.",
