  "title": "A scoping review of heart failure transitional care quality indicators and outcomes for use in clinical care and research.",
  "abstract": "AIMS: There are no accepted quality indicators for transitional care following hospitalization for heart failure (HF). Current quality measures focus on 30-day readmissions without accounting for competing risks such as death. In this scoping review of clinical trials, we aimed to develop a set of HF transitional care quality indicators for clinical or research applications following hospitalization for HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a scoping review using MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, HealthSTAR, reference lists and grey literature from January 1990 to November 2022. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adults hospitalized for HF who received a healthcare service or strategy intervention that aimed to improve patient-reported or clinical outcomes. We independently extracted data and performed a qualitative synthesis of the results. We generated a list of process, structure, patient-reported, and clinical measures that could be used as quality indicators. We highlighted process indicators that were associated with improved clinical outcomes and patient-reported outcomes that had high adherence to COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) and United States Food and Drug Administration standards. From 42 RCTs included in the study, we identified a set of process, structure, patient-reported, and clinical indicators that could be used as transitional care measures in clinical or research settings. CONCLUSION: In this scoping review, we developed a list of quality indicators that could guide clinical efforts or serve as research endpoints in transitional care in HF. Clinicians, researchers, institutions, and policymakers can use the indicators to guide management, design research, allocate resources, and fund services that improve clinical outcomes.",
