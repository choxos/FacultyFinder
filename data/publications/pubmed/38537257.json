  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to establish a cohort of persons with Crohn's disease (CD) enrolled from 14 Canadian centers to describe the contemporary presentation of CD in Canada. METHODS: All enrollees were at least 18 years old and underwent chart review for phenotype documentation by Montreal Classification at time of enrollment, comorbidities, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and other surgeries, and use IBD and other therapies. RESULTS: Of 2112 adults, 59% were female, and the mean age was 44.1 (+/-14.9SD) years. The phenotype distribution was B1 = 50.4%, B2 = 22.4%, B3 = 17.3%, and missing information = 9.9%. Perineal disease was present in 14.2%. Pertaining to disease location, 35.2% of patients had disease in L1, 16.8% in L2, 48% in L3, and 0.4% in L4. There was no difference in phenotype by gender, anxiety score, depression score. Disease duration was significantly different depending on disease behavior type (B1 = 12.2 ± 10.1; B2 = 19.4 ± 12.9; B3 = 18.9 ± 11.8, P < .0001). Isolated colonic disease was much less likely to be fibrostenotic or penetrating than inflammatory disease. Penetrating disease was more likely to be associated with ileocolonic location than other locations. Perineal disease was most commonly seen in persons with B3 disease behavior (24%) than other behaviors (11% B1; 20% B2 disease, P < .0001) and more likely to be seen in ileocolonic disease (L3;19%) vs L2 (17%) and L1 (11%; P < .0001). Surgery related to IBD occurred across each behavior types at the following rates: B1 = 23%, B2 = 64%, and B3 = 74%. Inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery rates by location of disease were L1 = 48%, L2 = 21%, and L3 = 51%. CONCLUSIONS: In exploring this large contemporary CD cohort we have determined that inflammatory disease is the main CD phenotype in Canada and that CD-related surgery remains very common.",
