  "title": "Eyelid Myokymia-a Presumed Manifestation of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to report eyelid myokymia in patients recently recovered from COVID-19 disease. A cohort of 15 patients who developed eyelid myokymia during or immediate post-recovery of systemic disease were evaluated. Demographic, clinical characteristics, effect of age, and hospitalization on the disease course were studied. The disease course was evaluated every month for 3 months period. All, except 2, patients had complete resolution of lid myokymia within 3 months of onset. Median [IQR] myokymia recovery time was 42 [31,60] days. Age and duration of hospitalization had a significant linear relationship with myokymia recovery time. Recovery was delayed by 2.64 days with every 1-year increment in age and by 6.19 days with every additional day of hospital stay. Recovery time was independent of severity of systemic disease (P = .055) and gender (P = 0.2). Eyelid myokymia can be a possible manifestation of COVID-19 recovery phase. While myokymia recovers gradually in all these patients, older age and a longer duration of hospitalization are associated with slower recovery.",
