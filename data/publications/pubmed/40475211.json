  "title": "The equity group: Supporting Cochrane's social responsibility of improving health equity.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health equity is a moral and ethical imperative for clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and all who use health research. Both Cochrane and the Campbell Collaboration have focused on health equity for many years. METHODS: The new Equity Group will continue and expand this work by designing a program of projects aiming to (1) promote equity in the evidence base, (2) ensure equitable processes for stakeholder engagement, (3) produce high-priority, equity-focused evidence syntheses, (4) build capacity for equity design, analysis, and reporting, and (5) promote equity in implementation tools. RESULTS: We will build on our current network of collaborators and create a group structure striving to recruit across the PROGRESS-Plus characteristics. CONCLUSION: We invite readers to join our cause and contribute wherever they are able. Together, we can help Cochrane achieve its social responsibility of improving health equity at a planetary level.",
