  "title": "Butterfly-Inspired Multiple Cross-Linked Dopamine-Metal-Phenol Bioprosthetic Valves with Enhanced Endothelialization and Anticalcification.",
  "abstract": "Valve replacement is the most effective means of treating heart valve diseases, and transcatheter heart valve replacement (THVR) is the hottest field at present. However, the durability of the commercial bioprosthetic valves has always been the limiting factor restricting the development of interventional valve technology. The chronic inflammatory reaction, calcification, and difficulty in endothelialization after the implantation of a glutaraldehyde cross-linked porcine aortic valve or bovine pericardium often led to valve degeneration. Improving the biocompatibility of valve materials and inducing endothelialization to promote in situ regeneration can extend the service life of valve materials. Herein, inspired by the hardening process of butterfly wings, this study proposed a dopamine-metal-phenol strategy to modify decellularized porcine pericardium (DPP). This is a strategy to make dopamine (DA) coordinate trivalent metal chromium ions (Cr(III)) with antiplatelets (PLTs) and anti-inflammatory properties, and then cross-link it with tea polyphenols (TP) to generate a valve scaffold that is mechanically comparable to glutaraldehyde-cross-linked scaffolds but avoids the cytotoxicity of aldehyde and presents better biocompatibility, hemocompatibility, anticalcification, and anti-inflammatory response properties.",
