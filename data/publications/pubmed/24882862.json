  "abstract": "At the 2013 annual meeting of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA), members were updated on educational areas in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Discussions included (1) the psoriasis and PsA GRAPPA video project, comprising a set of educational online videos that provide standardized psoriatic disease endpoint training to clinicians and researchers; (2) the GRAPPA Educational Outreach Project, focused on cross-disciplinary education for rheumatologists and dermatologists and including several collaborations to expand educational sessions globally; (3) the Dermatology and Rheumatology Trainee Educational Initiative, that provides psoriatic disease education to medical students, residents, and fellows training in dermatology and/or rheumatology; and (4) the GRAPPA Educational Slide Library, developed as a resource for GRAPPA members for their own educational presentations.",
