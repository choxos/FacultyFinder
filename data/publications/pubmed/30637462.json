  "title": "Abnormal amplitude of low frequency fluctuation and functional connectivity in non-neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus: a resting-state fMRI study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) disorders in non-neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (non-NPSLE) patients by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and to study whether there are some clinical biomarkers that can be used to monitor the brain dysfunction. METHODS: Based on the rs-fMRI data of 36 non-NPSLE patients and 30 normal controls, we first obtained the regions with abnormal ALFF signals in non-NPSLE patients. Then, by taking these areas as seed regions of interest (ROIs), we calculated the FC between ROIs and the whole brain to assess the network-level alterations. Finally, we correlated the altered values of ALFF and FC in non-NPSLE patients to some clinical data. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, non-NPSLE patients showed decreased ALFF in bilateral precuneus and increased ALFF in right cuneus and right calcarine fissure surrounding cortex (CAL). At network level, non-NPSLE patients exhibited higher FC between left precuneus and left middle occipital gyrus (MOG)/left superior occipital gyrus (SOG)/right middle frontal gyrus (MFG)/right dorsolateral superior frontal gyrus (SFGdor), and higher FC between right cuneus and bilateral precuneus/left posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG). The abnormal ALFF in right CAL and abnormal FC in right cuneus-left precuneus, right cuneus-right precuneus, and right cuneus-left PCG were correlated with the patients' certain clinical data (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Rs-fMRI is a promising tool for detecting the brain function disorders in non-NPSLE patients and to help understand the neurophysiological mechanisms. C4 and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index may be biomarkers of brain dysfunction in non-NPSLE patients.",
