  "title": "Fast reduction of a copper center in laccase by nitric oxide and formation of a peroxide intermediate.",
  "abstract": "The rapid reduction of one of the copper atoms (type 2) of tree laccase by nitric oxide (NO) has been detected. Addition of NO to native laccase in the presence of oxygen leads to EPR changes consistent with fast reduction and slow reoxidation of this metal center. These events are paralleled by optical changes that are reminiscent of formation and decay of the peroxide intermediate in a fraction of the enzyme population. Formation of this species is only possible if the trinuclear copper cluster (type 2 plus type 3) is fully reduced. This condition can only be met if, as suggested previously, a fraction of the enzyme contains both type 3 coppers already reduced before addition of NO. Our data are consistent with this assumption. We have suggested recently that fast reduction of copper is the mechanism by which NO interacts with the oxidized dinuclear center in cytochrome c oxidase. The present experiments using laccase strongly support this view and suggest this reaction as a general mechanism by which copper proteins interact with NO. In addition, this provides an unexploited way to produce a stable peroxide intermediate in copper oxidases in which the full complement of copper atoms is present. This enables the O-O scission step in the catalytic cycle to be studied by electron addition to the peroxide derivative through the native electron entry site, type 1 copper.",
