  "title": "Inhibitory mechanism of chrysin and diosmetin to α-glucosidase: insights from kinetics, multispectroscopy and molecular docking investigations.",
  "abstract": "Inhibition of α-glucosidase activity is a promising method to prevent postprandial hyperglycemia. The inhibitory effect and interaction of chrysin and diosmetin on α-glucosidase were studied in this study. The results of inhibition kinetics showed that chrysin and diosmetin reversibly inhibited α-glucosidase activity with IC50 value of 26.445 ± 1.406 μmol L[-1] and 18.380 ± 1.264 μmol L[-1], respectively. Further research revealed that chrysin exhibited a mixed-type inhibitory pattern against α-glucosidase, while diosmetin was noncompetitive inhibitory with Ki value of (2.6 ± 0.04) ×10[-4 ]mol L[-1]. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that both chrysin and diosmetin could quench the intrinsic fluorescence of α-glucosidase, the maximum emission wavelength of tyrosine (Tyr) and tryptophan (Trp) were not moved by chrysin, but red shifted by diosmetin. UV-Vis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and circular dichroism (CD) measurements showed that the secondary structure and microenvironment of α-glucosidase were changed by chrysin and diosmetin. Further analysis of molecular docking showed that chrysin and diosmetin could bind with α-glucosidase and might cause the decrease of α-glucosidase activity. The results of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation showed that the stability of chrysin (or diosmetin)-α-glucosidase complex system was changed during binding process. In conclusion, chrysin and diosmetin are good α-glucosidase inhibitors.",
