  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disabling orthopedic disease, which is impacted by infiltration of immune cells. Thus, the aim of the current research was to determine the inflammation-related biomarkers in ONFH. METHODS: GSE123568 dataset with control and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected by limma R package and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to explore the co-expression genes and modules. We obtained inflammation-related genes (IRGs) from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Then, the IRGs associated with SONFH (IRGs-SONFH) were screened out and analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database, and hub genes were identified by the MCODE algorithm. Based on the hub genes, we constructed a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. RESULTS: We identified 535 DEGs between control and SONFH samples. The WGCNA clearly indicated that the brown module was most significantly associated with SONFH. We identified 25 IRGs-SONFH through WGCNA module genes, DEGs and IRGs. A total of 4 hub genes (CD14, CYBB, NOD2, and TLR1) were identified by Cytoscape. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined that the expressions of the four genes could distinguish SONFH from controls as evidenced by the area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.7. Finally, we constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network which included 67 lncRNAs, 1 miRNA (hsa-miR-320a), and 1 mRNA (NOD2). CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified 4 hub genes as potential inflammation-related biomarkers of SONFH. Moreover, we proposed a ceRNA network of lncRNAs targeting hsa-miR-320a, hsa-miR-320a, and NOD2 as a potential RNA regulatory pathway that controls disease progression in ONFH.",
