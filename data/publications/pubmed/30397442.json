  "abstract": "Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition and precipitation are major drivers of global changes that are expected to influence plant nutrient resorption in desert ecosystems, where plant growth is often nutrient and water limited. However, knowledge on the effects of increased N and precipitation on them remain poorly understood. This study determined the effects of increased N (ambient, 60 kg N ha[-1] year[-1]) and water supply (ambient, +20%, +40%), and their combination on the leaf nutrient resorption of Artemisia ordosica, a dominant shrub in the Mu Us Desert of northern China. After 2 years of treatments, only N addition significantly decreased the N resorption efficiency of A. ordosica. Both N and water addition had no effect on the phosphorus (P) resorption efficiency of this shrub, and there were no interactive effects of N and water availability on shrub nutrient resorption. The responses of shrub leaf N:P ratio tended to saturate as soil available N:P increased. The aboveground net primary productivity of A. ordosica was positively correlated with leaf P resorption efficiency, rather than N resorption efficiency. Our results suggest that N addition exacerbated the P limitation of the shrub growth and played a more fundamental role than water addition in controlling the nutrient resorption process of the desert shrub A. ordosica. This information contributes to understand the relationship between nutrient conservation strategy and plant growth of desert shrub species under global environmental changes.",
