  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction present to hospitals without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) facilities and receive fibrinolysis. The role of routine early PCI after fibrinolysis, using stents and contemporary pharmacotherapy, has not been studied in a large adequately powered randomized trial. OBJECTIVE: To compare a pharmacoinvasive strategy of transfer for routine PCI within 6 hours after fibrinolysis with standard treatment after fibrinolysis (including predefined criteria for rescue PCI and delayed cardiac catheterization for patients who do not require rescue PCI). METHODS: A total of 1200 patients with high-risk ST-elevation myocardial infarction presenting to non-PCI centers will be randomized to a pharmacoinvasive strategy (transfer for routine PCI within 6 hours of fibrinolysis) or to standard treatment after fibrinolysis. The primary end point is the 30-day composite of death, reinfarction, recurrent ischemia, heart failure, or shock. RESULTS: More than 900 patients have been enrolled as of April 2007. An interim safety analysis of the first 536 patients demonstrated no safety concerns. Enrolment is expected to be completed in late 2007. CONCLUSIONS: This study will provide important data on whether routine early PCI within 6 hours after fibrinolysis is safe and superior to the standard treatment of fibrinolysis with rescue PCI or delayed cardiac catheterization.",
