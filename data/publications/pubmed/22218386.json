  "abstract": "Pseudotumors are a rare but important complication occurring with all types of hip replacements.The true prevalence of pseudotumors is debated.Potential causes of pseudotumors may include foreign-body reaction, hypersensitivity, and wear debris.The conduct of clinical trials on the incidence, causes, and treatments of pseudotumors has been inadequate as few investigators have used a randomized controlled design to compare various implant types.",
