  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The current gold standard for postoperative analgesia following a pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). Spinal analgesia with continuous wound infusion (CWI) of local anaesthetic is an emerging alternative modality. This non-inferiority study aimed to compare CWI with spinal analgesia to TEA and assess its impact on clinical outcomes. METHODS: A retrospective observational analysis of patients undergoing open pancreatoduodenectomy through a midline laparotomy. A total of 74 patients were included in the study forming two groups: CWI (n = 33) and TEA (n = 41). RESULTS: TEA resulted in lower median pain scores at rest (p = 0.002) and with coughing (p = 0.005) on postoperative day 2. CWI was non-inferior to TEA for all other pain outcomes measures from days 0-5. Patients in the CWI group had a shorter time to first bowel motion (p = 0.001), commencement of a liquid diet (p = 0.04), earlier removal of nasogastric tube (p = 0.005), abdominal drain (p = 0.003) and indwelling catheter (p < 0.001). Analgesic failure and postoperative nausea and vomiting were also less frequent (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: Local CWI with spinal analgesia was non-inferior to TEA for pain management in open pancreaticoduodenectomy. CWI demonstrated advantages in measures associated with enhanced recovery after surgery programs without disadvantages in terms of analgesia requirements.",
