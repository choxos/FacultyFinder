  "title": "Research priorities for the study of atrial fibrillation during acute and critical illness: recommendations from the Symposium on Atrial Fibrillation in Acute and Critical Care.",
  "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia encountered in acute and critical illness and is associated with poor short and long-term outcomes. Given the consequences of developing AF, research into prevention, prediction and treatment of this arrhythmia in the critically ill are of great potential benefit, however, study of AF in critically ill patients faces unique challenges, leading to a sparse evidence base to guide management in this population. Major obstacles to the study of AF in acute and critical illness include absence of a common definition, challenges in designing studies that capture complex etiology and assess causality, lack of a clear outcome set, difficulites in recruitment in acute environments with respect to timing, consent, and workflow, and failure to embed studies into clinical care platforms and capitalize on emerging technologies. Collaborative effort by researchers, clinicians, and stakeholders should be undertaken to address these challenges, both through interdisciplinary cooperation for the optimization of research efficiency and advocacy to advance the understanding of this common and complex arrhythmia, resulting in improved patient care and outcomes. The Symposium on Atrial Fibrillation in Acute and Critical Care was convened to address some of these challenges and propose potential solutions.",
