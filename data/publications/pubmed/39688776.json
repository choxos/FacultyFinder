  "title": "Clinical Profile and Treatment Adherence in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Chronic Kidney Disease Who Initiate an SGLT2 Inhibitor: A Multi-cohort Study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The clinical landscape for the treatment of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) is rapidly evolving. As part of the FOUNTAIN platform (NCT05526157; EUPAS48148), we described and compared cohorts of adult patients with CKD and T2D initiating a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) before the launch of finerenone in Europe, Japan, and the United States (US). METHODS: This was a multinational, multi-cohort study of patients with T2D in five data sources: the Danish National Health Registers (DNHR) (Denmark), PHARMO Data Network (The Netherlands), Valencia Health System Integrated Database (VID) (Spain), Japan Chronic Kidney Disease Database Extension (J-CKD-DB-Ex) (Japan), and Optum's de-identified Clinformatics[®] Data Mart Database (CDM) (US). Eligible patients had CKD (based on either diagnosis codes, eGFR values, and/or urine ACR) and initiated an SGLT2i between 2012 and 2021. Baseline demographic, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics were analyzed, and drug utilization patterns were described. RESULTS: The final cohorts included 21,739 patients in DNHR, 381 in PHARMO, 31,785 in VID, 1157 in J-CKD-DB-Ex, and 56,219 in CDM. Across data sources, approximately 41-70% had CKD stage 1 or 2 at baseline; severe CKD (stage 4) was uncommon (1.6-6.7%). The median duration of SGLT2i therapy ranged from 7.5 months in PHARMO to 17.0 months in VID. At least 50% of patients were currently receiving SGLT2i treatment at 1 year after initiation. CONCLUSIONS: At a 1-year follow-up, at least half of the patients with CKD and T2D were receiving SGLT2i treatment across the data sources. In patients initiating SGLT2i, treatment options for T2D and CKD were heterogeneous and dynamic within and among data sources.",
