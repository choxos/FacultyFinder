  "title": "Comparing outcomes of balloon-expandable vs. self-expandable valves in transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common heart condition categorized into congenital and acquired forms. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an innovative method for AS management, and two valve types, self-expanding valves (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV), are used in TAVR. The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes associated with balloon-expandable and self-expandable valves in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. METHODS: The researchers conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines and AMSTAR-2 tool. The methodology involved a systematic literature search, strict eligibility criteria, unbiased study selection, meticulous data extraction, quality assessment, and rigorous statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis included twenty-six papers and 26 553 patients. BEV exhibited significant advantages over SEV in overall mortality across 21 studies, particularly in perioperative and 30-day assessments. However, no substantial disparities emerged between the two valve types in stroke incidence. BEV demonstrated notable benefits in reducing hospitalization rates across 6 studies and significantly fewer instances of permanent pacemaker implantations across 19 studies, particularly evident in the perioperative setting. Other secondary outcomes like bleeding, acute kidney injury, and myocardial infarction showcased non-significant differences between BEV and SEV. CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that BEV may offer benefits in specific aspects of TAVR outcomes, but further research is needed to fully understand the factors influencing patient outcomes and mortality in TAVR procedures.",
