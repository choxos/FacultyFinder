  "title": "Moving Cancer Care Ontario's Exercise for People with Cancer guidelines into oncology practice: using the Theoretical Domains Framework to validate a questionnaire.",
  "abstract": "Evidence supporting the benefits of exercise surrounding cancer treatment has led to internationally published guidelines, with minimal uptake by oncology care providers (OCPs). There is a need to understand how to implement research evidence into practice. Our team developed a questionnaire to assess OCPs' knowledge of exercise guidelines and barriers/facilitators to exercise counseling and program referral. We validated the questionnaire using the Theoretical Domains Framework, a knowledge translation (KT) framework used to implement evidence-based guidelines into practice. In this commentary, we describe this process and the rationale for integrating a KT framework into intervention development and implementation in oncology practice. The revised questionnaire, entitled Clinicians Perspectives on Exercise in Patients with Cancer (CliPEC), is shared to facilitate the implementation process and allow for comparison across oncology practices.",
