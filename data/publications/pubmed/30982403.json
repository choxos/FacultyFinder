  "title": "Latent Class Models Reveal Poor Agreement between Discrete-Choice and Time Tradeoff Preferences.",
  "abstract": "Background. In health economics, there has been interest in using discrete-choice experiments (DCEs) to derive preferences for health states in lieu of previously established approaches like time tradeoff (TTO). We examined whether preferences elicited through DCEs are associated and agree with preferences elicited through TTO tasks. Methods. We used data from 1073 respondents to the Canadian EQ-5D-5L valuation study. Multivariate mixed-effects models specified a common likelihood for the TTO and discrete-choice data, with separate but correlated random effects for the TTO and DCE data, for each of the 5 EQ-5D-5L dimensions. Multivariate latent class models allowed separate but associated latent classes for the DCE and TTO data. Results. Correlation between the random effects for the 2 tasks ranged from -0.12 to 0.75, with only pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression having at least a 50% posterior probability of strong (>0.6) correlation. Latent classes for the TTO and DCE data both featured 1 latent class capturing participants attaching large disutilities to pain/discomfort, another capturing participants attaching large disutility to anxiety/depression, and the third class capturing the remainder. Agreement in class membership was poor (Îº coefficient: 0.081; 95% credible interval, 0.033-0.13). Fewer respondents expressed strong disutilities for problems with anxiety/depression or pain/discomfort in the TTO than the DCE data (17% v. 55%, respectively). Conclusions. Stated preferences using TTO and DCEs show association across dimensions but poor agreement at the level of individual health states within respondents. Joint models that assume agreement between DCE and TTO have been used to develop national value sets for the EQ-5D-5L. This work indicates that when combining data from both techniques, methods requiring association but not agreement are needed.",
