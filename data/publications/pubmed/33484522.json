  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pregnancy outcome of human immunodeficiency syndrome-positive mothers. METHODS: The prospective observational study was conducted at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital, Gujrat, Pakistan, from June 2011 to March 2018, and comprised pregnant women screened positive for human immunodeficiency syndrome. Risk factors and perinatal outcomes were noted on a predesigned proforma. Data was analysed using SPSS 20. RESULTS: Of the 74 subjects with a mean age of 29Â±5.27 years, 63(85.1%) were multiparous and 11(14.9%) were nulliparous. Major risk factors included unsterilized nasal or ear piercing in 70(94.6%) subjects, history of blood transfusion 57(77%) and history of dental procedure in unsterilized settings 23(31.1%). Spouses of 43(58.1%) subjects were positive for human immunodeficiency syndrome, 22(29.7%) were negative and 9(12.2%) had unknown status in this regard. In terms of outcome, 12(16.3%) subjects had spontaneous abortion, 11(12.2%) had intrauterine death of foetus, 6(8.1%) had preterm delivery and 45(60.8%) reached full term and were delivered. There were 2(2.6%) patients with stage 4 disease who died during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Human immunodeficiency syndrome infection in pregnant women was found to be associated with poor pregnancy outcome.",
