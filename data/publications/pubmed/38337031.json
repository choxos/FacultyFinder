  "title": "Functional analysis of Cdc20 reveals a critical role of CRY box in mitotic checkpoint signaling.",
  "abstract": "Accurate mitosis is coordinated by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) through the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), which inhibits the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C). As an essential regulator, Cdc20 promotes mitotic exit through activating APC/C and monitors kinetochore-microtubule attachment through activating SAC. Cdc20 requires multiple interactions with APC/C and MCC subunits to elicit these functions. Functionally assessing these interactions within cells requires efficient depletion of endogenous Cdc20, which is highly difficult to achieve by RNA interference (RNAi). Here we generated Cdc20 RNAi-sensitive cell lines which display a penetrant metaphase arrest by a single RNAi treatment. In this null background, we accurately measured the contribution of each known motif of Cdc20 on APC/C and SAC activation. The CRY box, a previously identified degron, was found critical for SAC by promoting MCC formation and its interaction with APC/C. These data reveal additional regulation within the SAC and establish a novel method to interrogate Cdc20.",
