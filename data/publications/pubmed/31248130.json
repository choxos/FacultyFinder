  "title": "Low Density Wood Particleboards Bonded with Starch Foam-Study of Production Process Conditions.",
  "abstract": "It has been shown that wood particleboards bonded with sour cassava starch can display low density combined with good physico-mechanical performance, thanks to starch being able to produce a strong foam that fills the interparticular space. Here we optimize the pressing conditions for the production of these panels. The procedure involved hot-plate pressing in two stages: (1) lowering the top platen to a specified thickness for a duration designated as pressing time, followed by (2) raising the top platen to allow panel expansion for a duration designated as hold time. The parameters studied were the pressing time (10 to 150 s), the hold time (290 to 890 s), and the top platen temperature (80 to 190 °C). The hold time and pressing time showed to be crucial parameters. The best operating conditions corresponded to 600 s of press cycle time, comprising 60 s of pressing time and 540 s of hold time. The top platen temperature used was 190 °C. The particleboards produced had a density of 405 kg·m[-3], an internal bond strength of 0.44 N·mm[-2], and a thickness swelling of 13.2%. This can be considered as very good performance, taking into account the panels' low density.",
