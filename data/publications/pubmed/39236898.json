  "title": "Healthy First-Degree Relatives From Multiplex Families vs Simplex Families Have Higher Subclinical Intestinal Inflammation, a Distinct Fecal Microbial Signature, and Harbor a Higher Risk of Developing Crohn's Disease.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Unaffected first-degree relatives (FDRs) from families with ≥2 affected FDRs with Crohn's disease (CD, multiplex families) have a high risk of developing CD, although the underlying mechanisms driving this risk are poorly understood. We aimed to identify differences in biomarkers between FDRs from multiplex vs simplex families and investigate the risk of future CD onset accounting for potential confounders. METHODS: We assessed the Crohn's and Colitis Canada Genetic Environmental Microbial cohort of healthy FDRs of patients with CD. Genome-wide CD-polygenic risk scores, urinary fractional excretion of lactulose-to-mannitol ratio, fecal calprotectin (FCP), and fecal 16S ribosomal RNA microbiome were measured at recruitment. Associations between CD multiplex status and baseline biomarkers were determined using generalized estimating equations models. Cox models were used to assess the risk of future CD onset. RESULTS: There were 4051 participants from simplex families and 334 from CD multiplex families. CD multiplex status was significantly associated with higher baseline FCP (P = .026) but not with baseline CD-polygenic risk scores or the lactulose-to-mannitol ratio. Three bacterial genera were found to be differentially abundant between both groups. CD multiplex status at recruitment was independently associated with an increased risk of developing CD (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.65; 95% confidence interval, 2.18-6.11, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Within FDRs of patients with CD, participants from multiplex families had a 3-fold increased risk of CD onset, a higher FCP, and an altered bacterial composition, but not genetic burden or altered gut permeability. These results suggest that putative environmental factors might be enriched in FDRs from multiplex families.",
