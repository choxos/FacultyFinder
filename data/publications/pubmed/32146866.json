  "abstract": "Bladder cancer is a common type of tumor among elderly male population; it causes intraocular metastasis (IOM). The study investigated the differences between elderly male bladder cancer patients with and without IOM, and identified risk factors for IOM. In this study, 749 elderly male patients (aged â‰¥50 years) with bladder cancer were included from November 2003 to December 2016. Differences between the IOM and non-IOM (NIOM) groups were evaluated by chi-square test and Student's t-test. The binary logistic regression analysis calculates the risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic value of IOM in elderly male patients with bladder cancer. The incidence of IOM in patients with bladder cancer was 1.7%. No significant differences were detected in age and histopathology between the IOM and NIOM groups. According to the study, the IOM group had higher ALP and Cyfra21-1. Binary logistic regression indicated that ALP and Cyfra21-1 were risk factors for IOM in elderly male bladder cancer patients (p < .05). ROC curve analysis revealed area under the curve values for ALP and Cyfra21-1 of 0.913 and 0.814, using cutoff values of 9.65 and 83.5 U/L, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity values for ALP were 61.5% and 95.8%, respectively, while those for Cyfra21-1 were 84.6% and 73.3%. The investigation indicates that ALP and Cyfra21-1 are risk factors for IOM in elderly male patients with bladder cancer and ALP is more reliable at distinguishing IOM from NIOM in elderly male patients with bladder cancer.",
