  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Same-day discharge of children after appendectomy for simple appendicitis is safe and associated with enhanced parent satisfaction. Our general pediatric surgeons aimed to improve the rate of same-day discharge after appendectomy for simple appendicitis. METHODS: We implemented a clinical practice guideline in September 2019. A surgeon-of-the-week service model and the urgent operating room started in November 2019 and January 2020, respectively. Data for children with simple appendicitis from our academic medical center were gathered prospectively using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric. Patient outcomes before intervention implementation (n = 278) were compared with patients following implementation (n = 264). RESULTS: The average monthly percentage of patients discharged on the day of surgery increased in the postimplementation group (32% versus 75%). Median postoperative length of stay decreased [16.5 hours (interquartile range, 15.9) versus 4.4 hours (interquartile range, 11.7), P < 0.001], and the proportion of patients discharged directly from the postoperative anesthesia care unit increased (22.8% versus 43.6%; P < 0.001). There were no differences in balancing measures, including the return to the emergency department and readmission. Fewer children were discharged home on oral antibiotics after implementation (6.8% versus 1.5%, P = 0.002), and opioid prescribing at discharge remained low (2.5% versus 1.1%, P = 0.385). CONCLUSIONS: Using quality improvement methodology and care standardization, we significantly improved the rate of same-day discharge after appendectomy for simple appendicitis without impacting emergency department visits or readmissions. As a result, our health care system saved 140 hospital days over the first 21 months.",
