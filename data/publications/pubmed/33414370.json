  "title": "Chronic unpredictable mild stress produces depressive-like behavior, hypercortisolemia, and metabolic dysfunction in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys.",
  "abstract": "Adolescent depression is a common and serious mental disorder with unique characteristics that are distinct from adult depression. The adult non-human primate stress-induced model of depressive-like behavior is an excellent model for the study of mechanisms; however, an adolescent nonhuman primate model is still lacking. Ten male adolescent cynomolgus monkeys were divided into a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS, n = 5) group and a control (CON, n = 5) group by age and weight-matched pairs. The CUMS group was exposed to multiple unpredictable mild stressors for five cycles over 55 days. At baseline, there were no differences between CUMS and CON groups. At endpoint, the CUMS group demonstrated significantly higher depressive-like behavior (huddle posture), and significantly lower locomotion compared with the CON group. Furthermore, depressive-like behavior increased from baseline to endpoint in the CUMS group, but not changed in the CON group. In the attempt for apple test, the CUMS group made significantly fewer attempts for the apple than the CON group. In the human intruder test, the CUMS group showed significantly higher anxiety-like behaviors in the stare phase than the CON group. Hair cortisol level was significantly higher in the CUMS group than the CON group at endpoint, and was also elevated from baseline to endpoint. Metabolic profiling of plasma at endpoint identified alterations in metabolite pathways which overlapped with those of adolescent depression patients. CUMS can induce depressive-like and anxiety-like behaviors, hypercortisolemia, and metabolic perturbations in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys. This is a promising model to study the mechanisms underlying adolescent depression.",
