  "title": "Cytotoxic and NF-κB and mitochondrial transmembrane potential inhibitory pentacyclic triterpenoids from Syzygium corticosum and their semi-synthetic derivatives.",
  "abstract": "Syzygium is a large genus of flowering plants, with several species, including the clove tree, used as important resources in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In our continuing search for anticancer agents from higher plants, a chloroform extract of the leaves and twigs of Syzygium corticosum collected in Vietnam was found to be active toward the HT-29 human colon cancer cell line. Separation of this extract guided by HT-29 cells and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) inhibition yielded 19 known natural products, including seven triterpenoids, three ellagic acid derivatives, two methylated flavonoids, a cyclohexanone, four megastigmanes, a small lactone, and an aromatic aldehyde. The full stereochemistry of (+)-fouquierol (2) was defined for the first time. Biological investigations showed that (+)-ursolic acid (1) is the major cytotoxic component of S. corticosum, which exhibited also potent activities in the NF-κB and mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP) inhibition assays conducted, with IC50 values of 31 nM and 3.5 µM, respectively. Several analogues of (+)-ursolic acid (1) were synthesized, and a preliminary structure-activity relationship (SAR) study indicated that the C-3 hydroxy and C-28 carboxylic acid groups and 19,20-dimethyl substitution are all essential in the mediation of the bioactivities observed for this triterpenoid.",
