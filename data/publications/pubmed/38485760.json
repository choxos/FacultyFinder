  "abstract": "Adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) benefit from cardiology follow-up at recommended intervals of â‰¤ 2 years. However, benefit for children is less clear given limited studies and unclear current guidelines. We hypothesize there are identifiable risks for gaps in cardiology follow-up in children with CHD and that gaps in follow-up are associated with differences in healthcare utilization. Our cohort included children < 10 years old with CHD and a healthcare encounter from 2008 to 2013 at one of four North Carolina (NC) hospitals. We assessed associations between cardiology follow-up and demographics, lesion severity, healthcare access, and educational isolation (EI). We compared healthcare utilization based on follow-up. Overall, 60.4% of 6,969 children received cardiology follow-up within 2 years of initial encounter, including 53.1%, 58.1%, and 79.0% of those with valve, shunt, and severe lesions, respectively. Factors associated with gaps in care included increased drive time to a cardiology clinic (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.92/15-min increase), EI (HR 0.94/0.2-unit increase), lesion severity (HR 0.48 for shunt/valve vs severe), and older age (HR 0.95/month if < 1 year old and 0.94/year if > 1 year old; p < 0.05). Children with a care gap subsequently had more emergency department (ED) visits (Rate Ratio (RR) 1.59) and fewer inpatient encounters and procedures (RR 0.51, 0.35; p < 0.05). We found novel factors associated with gaps in care for cardiology follow-up in children with CHD and altered health care utilization with a gap. Our findings demonstrate a need to mitigate healthcare barriers and generate clear cardiology follow-up guidelines for children with CHD.",
