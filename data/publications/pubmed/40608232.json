  "title": "Mbnl1 Protects Against Cerebral Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury by Modulating Microglia/Macrophage Polarization via NF-κB Pathway.",
  "abstract": "Activated and polarized microglia regulate neuroinflammatory responses and programmed cell death processes in ischemic stroke. Although the inactivation of muscleblind-like 1 (Mbnl1) is known to cause structural defects in the brain, its role in microglial apoptosis and polarization remains unclear. This study aims to explore the mechanism of Mbnl1 in ischemic stroke, particularly its role in the regulation of microglial apoptosis and polarization, as well as its impact on neuroinflammatory responses and cognitive dysfunction. The expression level of Mbnl1 in the serum of stroke patients was determined. Furthermore, Mbnl1 was overexpressed in a C57BL/6N stroke model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation model in BV-2 cells. Changes in relevant marker proteins were detected using histological assays, cognitive function tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for inflammatory factor detection, flow cytometry for apoptosis assessment, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. The expression level of Mbnl1 in the serum of stroke patients was determined. Furthermore, Mbnl1 was overexpressed in a C57BL/6N stroke model and an oxygen-glucose deprivation model in BV-2 cells. Changes in relevant marker proteins were detected using histological assays, cognitive function tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for inflammatory factor detection, flow cytometry for apoptosis assessment, immunofluorescence, and Western blot analysis. Mbnl1 overexpression exerts a protective effect against ischemic stroke by regulating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation through inhibition of the NF-κB signaling pathway. This modulation promotes cognitive recovery in C57BL/6N mice with stroke, highlighting Mbnl1 as a potential therapeutic target for stroke treatment.",
