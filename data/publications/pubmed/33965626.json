  "title": "Two-Thirds of Preterm Parents Would Participate in a Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Double Doses of Steroids to a Single Dose and Placebo.",
  "abstract": "Animal research strongly suggests that a single dose of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) is as effective as a double dose to mature preterm lungs; however, a human randomized controlled trial (RCT) is urgently needed. From August to November 2020, we conducted an online survey of Canadian parents of preterm infants. Survey respondents watched a parent-to-parent video introducing an RCT to study whether the standard double dose of ACS is non-inferior to a single dose (and matching placebo). Approximately two-thirds of respondents reported they were either likely or very likely to participate in the RCT, indicating high parental interest in and support for such a trial.",
