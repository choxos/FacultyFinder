  "abstract": "With improved surgical outcomes, infants and children with congenital heart disease (CHD) may die from other causes of death (COD) other than CHD. We sought to describe the COD in youth with CHD in North Carolina (NC). Patients from birth to 20 years of age with a healthcare encounter between 2008 and 2013 in NC were identified by ICD-9 code. Patients who could be linked to a NC death certificate between 2008 and 2016 were included. Patients were divided by CHD subtypes (severe, shunt, valve, other). COD was compared between groups. Records of 35,542 patients < 20 years old were evaluated. There were 15,277 infants with an annual mortality rate of 3.5 deaths per 100 live births. The most frequent COD in infants (age < 1 year) were CHD (31.7%), lung disease (16.1%), and infection (11.4%). In 20,265 children (age 1 to < 20 years), there was annual mortality rate of 9.7 deaths per 1000 at risk. The most frequent COD in children were CHD (34.2%), neurologic disease (10.2%), and infection (9.5%). In the severe subtype, CHD was the most common COD. In infants with shunt-type CHD disease, lung disease (19.5%) was the most common COD. The mortality rate in infants was three times higher when compared to children. CHD is the most common underlying COD, but in those with shunt-type lesions, extra-cardiac COD is more common. A multidisciplinary approach in CHD patients, where development of best practice models regarding comorbid conditions such as lung disease and neurologic disease could improve outcomes in this patient population.",
