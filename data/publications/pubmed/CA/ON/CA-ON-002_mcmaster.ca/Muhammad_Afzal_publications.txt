TI  - A survey of blood groups.
PG  - 426-8
AB  - A survey was conducted to investigate into the frequency of different blood 
      groups in Punjab. A total of 1415 persons were included in this survey. The slide 
      method was used for determination of ABO and AB blood groups as well as Rh 
      factor. The frequency of blood group A was 21.20%; B, 36.16%; AB, 9.05% and O, 
      34.14%. Distribution of blood groups among various castes revealed the incidence 
      of blood group A, 13.57% to 30%; B, 28.125% to 50%; O, 16.67% to 40%; and AB, 
      zero to 25%. Only 2.76% cases were found to be Rh negative. Rh negative frequency 
      was much higher in Baluchs, Awans and Gujjars than Rajputs, Jats and Arains.

TI  - Modification of liver and serum enzymes by paraquat treatment in rabbits.
PG  - 279-91
AB  - Paraquat (PQ) is known to cause progressive interstitial fibrosis in the lungs. 
      Previous investigations have indicated that PQ acts by lipid peroxidation of the 
      membrane. However, there are few reports on the action of PQ on hepatic enzymes. 
      This work was carried out to investigate the modulation of various hepatic 
      enzymes by PQ in rabbits. Paraquat was administered at a dose of 3, 6 or 12 mg/kg 
      b. wt/day intraperitoneally to male rabbits for different periods of time. 
      Administration of paraquat resulted in a significant decrease in plasma 
      activities of transaminase enzymes, alkaline phosphatase and liver transketolase. 
      No significant change was found in the activities of plasma and hepatic lactate 
      dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase. A marked increase in blood glucose was 
      noticed 48 hours after paraquat administration.

      protection in buffalo calves against haemorrhagic septicaemia. Sera from calves 
      with known protection status in experimental challenge were titrated by 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against all antigens. Capsular antigen 
      extracted with 2.5% sodium chloride was superior to other antigens for assessing 
      protection status of buffalo calves against P. multocida by ELISA. This capsular 
      antigen was able to differentiate clearly between well-protected, protected and 
      unprotected animals.

AB  - The study was carried out to determine the aetiological agent(s) associated with 
      hydropericardium syndrome (Angara disease) in broilers in Pakistan. The results 
      indicate that in addition to adenovirus some other agent is involved in causing 
      the disease but that this agent requires co-infection by an adenovirus for the 
      reproduction of the typical signs of the syndrome. The nature of this agent 
      remains unknown because no discrete virus or virus-like particle could be seen by 
      electron microscopy.

AB  - 1. Homogenates of garlic (Allium sativum), onions (Allium cepa) and Allium porum 
      were in vitro incubated with [14C]arachidonic acid. 2. Separation of labelled 
      prostaglandins and thromboxanes were accomplished by thin-layer chromatography 
      (TLC) and the Rf values were compared with those of authentic standards. 3. The 
      prostaglandins identified were 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, PGF2 alpha, TXB2, PGE2 and 
      PGD2. 4. PGE2 and PGD2 were the major metabolites of arachidonic acid among all 
      the members of the Liliaceae family studied. 5. Garlic was found to have the 
      highest capacity to metabolize the [14C]arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and 
      thromboxanes. 6. The synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, was inhibited 
      by preincubation of homogenates with indomethacin or was completely destroyed by 
      boiling the plant extract prior to incubation with arachidonic acid. This 
      confirmed the presence of cyclooxygenase in these plants.

TI  - Effect of reactor retention on the spread of brucellosis in Jersey cattle and 
      buffalo herds.
PG  - 1179-85
AB  - The rate of spread of bovine brucellosis was investigated in buffalo and Jersey 
      cattle herds maintained at a Livestock Research station in Pakistan. Reactor 
      animals (identified by conventional serological tests) were either retained or 
      culled because of advanced age or poor productivity. Reactors were housed, 
      managed and fed separately from the rest of the herds. The initial seroprevalence 
      of brucellosis among both the Jersey cattle and the buffalo tested was 21.4%, the 
      difference being statistically insignificant (p = 0.218). For 34 months, the 
      spread of brucellosis was limited to 25 new reactors in the 334 cows and 33 in 
      the 442 buffaloes. The mean attack rate was 7.5% for both herds during the test 
      intervals. Trend analysis of proportions positive at each testing revealed a 
      significant decrease in the percentages observed at the first testing. The 
      management practice of segregation offered some advantage in reducing the spread 
      of brucellosis to negative animals. However, an epidemiological study covering a 
      large number of herds would be required to identify risk factors responsible for 
      perpetuating the disease.

TI  - A potent thromboxane formation inhibitor in green tea leaves.
PG  - 281-3
AB  - A ninhydrin positive compound (L2) now identified as 
      2-amino-5-(N-ethylcarboxyamido)-pentanoic acid, from unprocessed tea leaves was a 
      potent inhibitor of thrombin-stimulated thromboxane formation in rabbit whole 
      blood (Ali and Afzal; Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Medicine, 27: 9, 1987). In 
      the present study, processed and unprocessed tea leaf extracts were given to rats 
      to consume for a period of eight weeks. Cholesterol and thromboxane levels were 
      measured in the serum obtained from clotting the blood at 37 degrees C. A 
      significant reduction in thromboxane levels was observed in rats taking 
      unprocessed tea extract. This reduction was equally distributed in adult as well 
      as in juvenile rats. However no appreciable changes in the levels of thromboxane 
      were noticed in the serum of rats taking processed tea extracts. This might be 
      due to the presence of a labile component which is destroyed during the 
      processing of green tea leaves. A decreased level of cholesterol was observed in 
      rats consuming unprocessed tea extract. This decrease could be linked to the 
      decrease in thromboxane levels as observed. Processed tea refers to commercially 
      available tea of different brands while unprocessed tea refers to dried green tea 
      leaves.

AB  - Field trials were used to assess the efficacy of an inactivated vaccine against 
      hydropericardium syndrome in broiler chickens. A single vaccination at 10 to 12 
      days old was effective for the control of the syndrome; mortality in the 
      vaccinated birds was 0.52 per cent compared with 5.34 per cent in unvaccinated 
      birds kept at the same premises. Vaccination was also effective when carried out 
      in the face of an outbreak; mortality in the vaccinated infected birds was 2.33 
      per cent compared with 10.27 per cent in unvaccinated infected birds. The data 
      indicate that a formalinised vaccine prepared from the liver of experimentally 
      infected birds could be used for the control of hydropericardium syndrome.

TI  - Involvement of prostaglandins in paraquat intoxication.
PG  - 213-5
AB  - Paraquat is known to cause severe lung damage through pulmonary edema as its 
      initial feature of toxicity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the 
      toxicity of paraquat in rabbits intraperitoneally injected with 2 or 4 mg/kg/day 
      of the herbicide for a period of 7 days. In the lung, prostaglandin levels of the 
      intoxicated rabbits showed a significant increase in PGF2 alpha. This increase 
      was dose dependent. However, a nonsignificant change in the 6-keto-PGF1 alpha was 
      also observed. Plasma and serum levels of thromboxane-B2 were also significantly 
      elevated but the levels of 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were affected nonsignificantly. The 
      pathology of elevated levels of PGF2 alpha and TXB2 in the lung and blood, in 
      response to paraquat toxicity, is discussed.

TI  - Effect of paraquat administered intraperitoneally on the nonpolar lipids of 
      rabbits.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - Rabbits were injected intraperitoneally with 3, 6, or 12 mg of paraquat/kg/day 
      for a period of 3, 7, or 14 days. Rabbits receiving 3 or 6 mg of paraquat/kg/day 
      showed a significant loss of body weight at 7 days of the treatment. Liver, 
      kidney, heart, and lungs demonstrated a significant decrease in their weights in 
      the first 3 days of paraquat treatment. A decrease in total lipids, total 
      triglycerides, and total cholesterol of both liver and kidney was observed. This 
      decrease was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma total triglycerides 
      and total cholesterol at 7 days of paraquat treatment. The ratio of cholesterol 
      to cholesterol esters in liver decreased after 3 days of paraquat treatment after 
      which it showed a consistent increase until the 14th day of the paraquat 
      treatment. In kidney, this ratio increased for up to 7 days of paraquat treatment 
      followed by a decrease at the 14th day. These results indicate, contrary to 
      earlier reports, that rabbits are susceptible to paraquat toxicity.

TI  - A potent inhibitor of thrombin stimulated platelet thromboxane formation from 
      unprocessed tea.
PG  - 9-13
AB  - A ninhydrin positive compound (L2) from commercially available unfermented dry 
      green tea (Thea sinesis) leaves is found to be a potent inhibitor of 
      thrombin-stimulated thromboxane formation in rabbit whole blood. Its potency is 
      compared with caffeine, a member of the methylxanthines family. Both caffeine and 
      L2 inhibit thromboxane formation in whole blood in a dose dependent fashion. L2 
      inhibition when calculated as I50 by a dose response curve is found to be more 
      than 40 fold stronger than caffeine as an inhibitor of thromboxane formation. A 
      concentration of L2 as low as 50 microM, suppresses thromboxane formation (by 
      84%) whereas a concentration of 5000 microM is necessary to achieve the same 
      inhibition with caffeine. The potent inhibitory effect of L2 on the TXB2 
      production maybe of benefit in the treatment of vascular disease.

TI  - Isolation and antigenic reactivity of Brucella ovis outer membrane proteins.
PG  - 2132-5
AB  - Brucella ovis cell membranes were isolated from fractured and lysozyme-treated 
      cells by ultracentrifugation. These preparations appeared to consist largely of 
      outer membranes, as judged from the results of ultracentrifugation experiments in 
      sucrose density gradients under conditions that are widely used to separate inner 
      and outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. The sequential detergent 
      extraction of cell membranes yielded mainly lipopolysaccharide and three groups 
      of outer membrane proteins. In immunoblotting, lipopolysaccharide had good 
      antigenic reactivity with all sera from rams exposed to B. ovis (vaccination or 
      natural infection), but some outer membrane proteins reacted strongly only with 
      sera from immune (vaccinated) rams, not from infected rams, suggesting a possible 
      diagnostic role for such proteins in predicting immunity or infection.

TI  - Immune response in rams experimentally infected with Brucella ovis.
PG  - 85-9
AB  - Cellular as well as humoral immune responses were detected in six rams 
      experimentally infected with Brucella ovis. Specific antibodies were detectable 
      by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay by day 11 after infection in all the rams. 
      The levels of IgM antibodies and total antibodies in the serum rose until 33 and 
      41 days after infection respectively, then levelled off. Antigen-induced 
      blastogenic responses by lymphocytes developed as early as five days after 
      infection in all rams but had decreased to low levels by day 63 in most. 
      Blastogenesis induced by phytohaemagglutinin and concanavalin A varied among 
      infected rams and did not differ significantly (P greater than 0.05) from control 
      rams. All rams had developed delayed-type skin hypersensitivity by day 63 after 
      infection. One ram which did not become infected as a result of exposure had low 
      levels of B ovis serum antibodies and a detectable antigen-induced lymphocyte 
      blastogenic response before infection, suggesting the involvement of 
      cell-mediated immunity in protection against B ovis.

TI  - Lipid composition of the epidermal gel secretion from the Arabian Gulf catfish 
      (Arius thalassinus Ruppell).
PG  - 41-7
AB  - Lipids associated with a threat induced epidermal gel secretion from the catfish, 
      Arius thalassinus, have been analyzed. Phospholipids, neutral lipids and 
      glycolipids are all present and each of these subclasses has been analyzed by 
      thin layer and gas chromatography with a general similarity with membrane lipids 
      being noted. The epidermal gel lipids differed from total liver lipids of the 
      catfish. Fatty acid analysis showed the gel lipid to be rich in the unsaturated 
      fatty acids: oleate (omega 7, C18:1), arachidonate (omega 6, C20:4), and 
      docosahexaenoate (omega 3, C22:6). Some prostaglandins were quantitated in lipid 
      extracts from the epidermal gel.

TI  - Characterization of Brucella ovis lipopolysaccharide and its use for diagnosis of 
      ram epididymitis by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
PG  - 1159-64
AB  - Rough lipopolysaccharide, extracted by a mixture of phenol, chloroform, and 
      petroleum ether from freeze-dried Brucella ovis cells with a yield of 0.71%, 
      contained relatively small amounts of protein and nucleic acid contaminants as 
      compared with lipopolysaccharides from other Brucellae. The crude 
      lipopolysaccharide was suitable as a diagnostic antigen in an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay for the sensitive and specific detection of ram epididymitis 
      caused by B. ovis infection. In comparative serological tests, the enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay with B. ovis lipopolysaccharide gave better identification of 
      infections and fewer false-negative results than the enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay with sonicated antigen or the complement fixation test.

TI  - Evaluation of Caralluma tuberculata pretreatment for the protection of rat 
      gastric mucosa against toxic damage.
PG  - 1-8
AB  - The ethanolic extract of Caralluma tuberculata N. E. Brown has been screened for 
      its potential to protect gastric mucosa against the injuries caused by 80% 
      ethanol, 0.2 M NaOH, hypertonic saline, and indomethacin. C. tuberculata at doses 
      of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg body wt given 30 min before the necrotizing agents 
      provided dose-dependent protection against the damage caused by all tested 
      agents. The effects caused by ethanol were further investigated. Treatment of 
      rats with 1 ml of 80% ethanol (gavage) was found to cause depletion of 
      stomach-wall mucus, to lower the concentrations of proteins, nucleic acids, and 
      nonprotein sulfhydryl groups in the stomach wall, and to cause histopathological 
      lesions, including necrosis, erosions, congestion, and hemorrhage, of the stomach 
      wall. C. tuberculata treatment caused a dose-dependent protection against all 
      these effects. In the same manner it affected malondialdehyde concentrations 
      altered by ethanol treatment. C. tuberculata also offered protection against 
      mucosal damage caused by indomethacin. The protective effects of C. tuberculata 
      in addition to its effects on mucus production and nonprotein sulfhydryl 
      concentration may be mediated through its free radical scavenging and 
      prostaglandin inducing properties.

TI  - Effects of inbreeding on marriage payment in north India.
PG  - 333-7
AB  - This study examines the relationships between consanguineous marriages and 
      marriage payment, using data from two Muslim qaums living in urban and rural 
      areas in Aligarh District, Uttar Pradesh, North India. Qaum and locality were 
      found to have no significant association with the dowry system. Marriage payment 
      is less common in consanguineous than in non-consanguineous marriages. However, 
      the association between marriage payment and the type of marriage is significant 
      at p < 0.001. The dowry system is more prevalent among the higher socioeconomic 
      groups, while the bride-wealth system is more common among the lower 
      socioeconomic groups.

TI  - Inbreeding and congenital heart diseases in a north Indian population.
PG  - 288-91
AB  - The study was performed in six mohallahs (colonies) of Aligarh City (North 
      India). All six mohallahs are predominantly inhabited by Qureshi (meat sellers, a 
      highly endogamous group) Muslims. A total of 1721 infants and children up to the 
      age of 6 years were examined to determine the incidence of congenital heart 
      diseases (CHD) in relation to the degree of consanguinity of the parents. Around 
      43% of the subjects were the offspring of consanguineous marriages including 
      second-cousin, first-cousin-once-removed and first-cousin. A higher percentage of 
      CHD was found in the offspring of consanguineous marriages: about 3.37% out of 
      741 children as compared to 1.22% in 980 offspring of non-consanguineous 
      marriages, whereas in the first-cousin offspring, the percentage of CHD rose to 
      4.41%. The differences were found to be statistically significant. The present 
      study suggests a genetic influence and also casts doubt on the applicability of a 
      polygenic threshold model to all forms of cardiac malformation.

AB  - Prevalence of antibodies against some important disease agents in sera from 
      racing camels in Abu Dhabi (United Arab Emirates) is reported. Antibodies against 
      Brucella abortus were detected in 1.5% of racing camels, but only 0.76% had 
      titres sufficient for the animals to be considered infected. The complement 
      fixation test revealed antibodies against Coxiella burnetii (causative agent of Q 
      fever) in 7.9% of camels (with a geometrical mean titre of 13) and against 
      parainfluenza virus type 3 in 5.6% of camels (with a geometrical mean titre of 
      20). Serological evidence did not show the presence of Aspergillus spp., while 
      antibodies against Leptospira interrogans were seen in 4.1% of camels. Antibodies 
      against Echinococcus polymorphus were observed in 2.6% of the animals, while a 
      large number of racing camels (30.9% and 36.4%) possessed antibodies against 
      Toxoplasma gondii, as determined by direct agglutination and indirect 
      haemagglutination, respectively.

AB  - This study presents the assessment of inbreeding depression on the intelligence 
      quotient among north Indian Muslim Children of school age. The Wechsler 
      Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-R)-74 was given to the children in both 
      groups (50 each non-inbred and inbred of the first-cousin status), aged 6 to 11 
      years and from the same socio-economic status. The change of the mean follows 
      genetic theory; however, the nature of the change in variance seems to be 
      somewhat different.

OAB - The level of inbreeding depression on the intelligence quotient (IQ) of North 
      Indian Muslim schoolchildren was assessed in a survey conducted in Aligarh. The 
      50 inbred children were products of marriages between first cousins; their mean 
      age was 7.7 years (range, 6-11 years). A significant (p 0.001) negative 
      association was found between inbreeding and score on the Weschler Intelligence 
      Scale for Children (WISC-C). In addition, the weighted mean IQ of inbred children 
      )88.4 + or - 1.37) differed significant (p 0.001) from that recorded among 50 
      noninbred controls of similar age and socioeconomic status (99.6 + or - 2.0). The 
      group means for both verbal and performance IQ subscales differed significantly 
      and in the expected direction between subjects and controls, but the lower 
      variance recorded in the inbred group did not conform to genetic theory. However, 
      data do not always demonstrate a clear trend of linear increase in phenotypic 
      variance with inbreeding in human populations. Additional surveys in other 
      populations and for various inbreeding levels are recommended.

PG  - 407-8
AB  - Mesenchymoma (hamartoma) of the chest wall is an extremely rare tumour presenting 
      in early infancy or fetal life. Pleural, pulmonary, and lymph node metastases 
      developed in a young man with malignant mesenchymoma of the chest wall. The 
      tumour had several characteristics that differ from the mesenchymoma reported 
      from the other parts of the body.

TI  - Effect of storage on some constituents of camel serum.
PG  - 212-5
AB  - Effects of storage at room temperature (23-25 degrees C) and refrigeration (4-5 
      degrees C) on various biochemical constituents of camel serum were investigated. 
      Albumin, globulin, calcium, phosphorus, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AP) and gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) did not 
      change over 9 days when stored at 4-5 degree C. At 4-5 degree C, creatinine, iron 
      and glucose in camel sera remained stable for 6 days; total protein for 7 days; 
      and blood urea nitrogen for 8 days. Decreased activities in creatine kinase (CK), 
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were apparent 
      after 1, 6, and 7 days, respectively. At room temperature, total protein, 
      albumin, globulin, calcium and phosphorus were stable throughout the 9 days. 
      Changes in glucose and iron occurred after 3 days. Stability at room temperature 
      for LDH was 1 day; AST, 3 days; GGT and ALT, 6 days; and AP, 8 days. CK activity 
      had already declined by 4 hours and by 9 days, only 34% activity remained.

PG  - 504-6
AB  - A case of intrathoracic extramedullary hematopoietic tumor associated with 
      hemoglobin C disease is reported in a 27-year-old Bangladeshi man. The patient's 
      initial complaints were generalized weakness, weight loss, and left upper 
      abdominal pain. Hospital workup revealed a solitary intrathoracic mass in the 
      posterior mediastinum, which was suspected to be a lymphoma based on fine-needle 
      aspiration. The mass was excised and proved to be an extramedullary hematopoietic 
      tumor. The problem of differential diagnosis is discussed.

TI  - Management of psoriasis with Aloe vera extract in a hydrophilic cream: a 
      placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
PG  - 505-9
AB  - The purpose of this double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the 
      clinical efficacy and tolerability of topical Aloe vera extract 0.5% in a 
      hydrophilic cream to cure patients with psoriasis vulgaris. Sixty patients 
      (36M/24F) aged 18-50 years (mean 25.6) with slight to moderate chronic 
      plaque-type psoriasis and PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scores between 
      4.8 and 16.7 (mean 9.3) were enrolled and randomized to two parallel groups. The 
      mean duration of the disease prior to enrollment was 8.5 years (range 1-21). 
      Patients were provided with a precoded 100g tube, placebo or active (with 0.5% 
      Aloe vera extract), and they self-administered trial medication topically 
      (without occlusion) at home 3 times daily for 5 consecutive days per week 
      (maximum 4 weeks active treatment). Patients were examined on a weekly basis and 
      those showing a progressive reduction of lesions, desquamation followed by 
      decreased erythema, infiltration and lowered PASI score were considered healed. 
      The study was scheduled for 16 weeks with 12 months of follow-up on a monthly 
      basis. The treatment was well tolerated by all the patients, with no adverse 
      drug-related symptoms and no dropouts. By the end of the study, the Aloe vera 
      extract cream had cured 25/30 patients (83.3%) compared to the placebo cure rate 
      of 2/30 (6.6%) (P < 0.001) resulting in significant clearing of the psoriatic 
      plaques (328/396 (82.8%) vs placebo 28/366 (7.7%), P < 0.001) and a decreased 
      PASI score to a mean of 2.2. The findings of this study suggest that topically 
      applied Aloe vera extract 0.5% in a hydrophilic cream is more effective than 
      placebo, and has not shown toxic or any other objective side-effects. Therefore, 
      the regimen can be considered a safe and alternative treatment to cure patients 
      suffering from psoriasis.

AB  - Pure cultures of Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were obtained from 11 cases 
      of lymphadenitis (known locally as taloa or mala) in camels. Camel isolates 
      produced typical taloa in camels experimentally inoculated subcutaneously at the 
      base of the external ear with 10(10) colony forming units. A sheep strain of C. 
      pseudotuberculosis inoculated into camels produced a local abscess at the site of 
      inoculation but did not produce taloa. Re-infection of camels recovered from 
      experimental inoculation did not produce taloa suggesting the possibility of the 
      development of a vaccine against lymphadenitis in camels.

TI  - Gastric antiulcer and cytoprotective effect of Commiphora molmol in rats.
PG  - 141-50
AB  - The aqueous suspension of Commiphora molmol (oleo-gum resin) has been screened 
      for its potential to protect gastric mucosa against the ulcers caused by 80% 
      ethanol, 25% NaCl, 0.2 M NaOH, indomethacin and combined indomethacin-ethanol 
      treatment. C. molmol pretreatment at doses of 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg provided 
      dose-dependent protection against the ulcerogenic effects of different 
      necrotizing agents used. The effects caused by ethanol were further investigated. 
      Treatment of rats with 1 ml of 80% ethanol was found to cause depletion of 
      stomach wall mucus, reduction in the concentration of protein, nucleic acids and 
      NP-SH groups in the stomach wall. Ethanol treatment also caused histopathological 
      lesions including necrosis, erosion, congestion and haemorrhage of the stomach 
      wall. Pretreatment with C. molmol offered a dose-dependent protection against all 
      these effects. In the same manner it affected the malondialdehyde concentration 
      altered by ethanol treatment. C. molmol also offered protection against mucosal 
      damage caused by indomethacin and its combination with ethanol. The protective 
      effect of C. molmol observed in the present study is attributed to its effect on 
      mucus production, increase in nucleic acid and non-protein sulfhydryl 
      concentration, which appears to be mediated through its free radical-scavenging, 
      thyroid-stimulating and prostaglandin-inducing properties.

TI  - Effects of aqueous extract of onion on the liver and lung of rats.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - The toxic effects of oral and intraperitoneal administration of onion extracts on 
      lung and liver tissue of rats were investigated. Oral or intraperitoneal 
      administration of low doses of onion (50 mg/kg) to rats had little effect on lung 
      and liver tissues when compared to control animals. In contrast, administration 
      of high doses of onion (500 mg/kg) resulted in apparent histological changes in 
      lung and liver tissues of rats. Intraperitoneal administration of the high dose 
      of onion was more damaging to lung and liver tissue than oral administration and 
      resulted in a 25% rate of mortality in this treatment group. These results 
      suggest that low doses of onion are nontoxic and may be administered with few ill 
      effects.

TI  - Fatty acid composition of human milk in Kuwaiti mothers.
PG  - 261-7
AB  - Kuwaiti diet is exceptionally rich in fat, carbohydrates and proteins. In 
      addition, subjects in Kuwait are exposed to extreme heat and sun light. Fatty 
      acid profiles of human milk obtained from 19 full breast feeding Kuwaiti mothers 
      were analyzed. Dietary patterns for individual mothers were determined by 24 h 
      dietary recall and food frequency questionnaire. The fatty acid content of human 
      milk was affected by the diet consumed by the lactating mother. The content of 
      long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCP) in human milk lipids did not 
      correlate with their parent fatty acids like linoleic and alpha-linolenic acids. 
      However the human milk LCP were related to the of content of LCP in the maternal 
      diet. Mothers reporting a high fish consumption showed significant amounts of 
      C22:6, omega 3 and C20:5, omega 3 fatty acids. As a general conclusion, breast 
      milk produced by a well nourished mother is better suited to meet the lipid 
      requirements of infants.

TI  - Genotoxic effects of estradiol-17beta on human lymphocyte chromosomes.
PG  - 109-15
AB  - The cytogenetic effect of a hormonal steroid, estradiol-17beta, was assessed in 
      peripheral blood human lymphocyte culture. Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and 
      chromosome aberrations (CA) were scored as genetic end points. Significant 
      induction of CA was observed at 25 microg/ml and 50 microg/ml concentrations of 
      estradiol-17beta in the absence of microsomal activation. The drug was effective 
      in all treatments in the presence of rat liver S(9) microsomal fraction (S(9) 
      mix) and exhibited increased frequency of chromosomal aberrations. The drug was 
      effective in increasing the SCE frequency which was found to be maximum at the 
      dose of 50 microg/ml concentration (i.e., 4.34+/-1.22) both with and without 
      metabolic activation. It was found that estradiol-17beta itself and possibly its 
      metabolites are potent mutagens beyond a particular dose in human lymphocytes.

TI  - Ultrasonographic renal size in individuals without known renal disease.
PG  - 12-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to establish some preliminary data of our population, we 
      determined the ultrasonographic kidney dimensions in individuals without known 
      renal disease. We assessed whether age, sex, side, body mass index (BMI) and 
      presence or absence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension affect the renal size. 
      METHODS: Ultrasonographic kidney measurements were performed on 194 adult 
      patients without known kidney lesions. Measurements included length, width, 
      cortical thickness and estimation of renal size which was obtained by multiplying 
      the first three variables. The effect of age, gender, side, height, weight, BMI, 
      hypertension and diabetes mellitus was statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The mean 
      kidney length was 10.4 +/- 0.8 cm, mean with 4.5 +/- 0.6 cm and mean cortical 
      thickness 1.6 +/- 0.2 cm. The estimated mean renal size was 76 +/- 22 cm3. Kidney 
      length did not significantly differ between right and left, however, kidney 
      width, cortical thickness and size did (p < 0.05). Right kidneys were smaller 
      than the left ones. In univariate analysis, the mean renal size correlated with 
      age, sex, side, BMI and absence or presence of hypertension and diabetes 
      mellitus. In a multivariate analysis, however, the only significant factors 
      affecting renal size were sex and BMI. CONCLUSION: We conclude that renal size is 
      related to age, side, sex and the individual's height and weight. 
      Population-based studies are needed to establish the normal values for the 
      Pakistani population.

TI  - Garlic and onions: their effect on eicosanoid metabolism and its clinical 
      relevance.
PG  - 55-73
AB  - Garlic (Allium sativum) and onion (Allium cepa) are among the oldest of all 
      cultivated plants. Additionally, both plants have been used as medicinal agents 
      for thousands of years. Both garlic and onion have been shown to have 
      applications as antimicrobial, antithrombotic, antitumor, hypolipidaemic, 
      antiarthritic and hypoglycemic agents. In recent years, extensive research has 
      focussed on the beneficial and medicinal properties of garlic and onions. In 
      particular, the use of these agents in the treatment and prevention of 
      cardiovascular disease and cancer is an area of considerable investigation and 
      interest.

TI  - Trend of blood pressure in north Indian children.
PG  - 304-10
AB  - In the summer of 899 School Children (473 boys and 426 girls) aged 6-11 years in 
      Aligarh district, Northern part of India were measured of blood pressure, height 
      and weight. Systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure have a strong 
      positive correlation with age, height and weight (P < 0.001). There is no 
      significant difference in SBP, DBP and MBP among the boys and girls of 
      corresponding age. Inspite of sample fluctuation weight has shown a strong 
      correlation with blood pressure (P < 0.001) among both sexes in any of the age 
      groups.

TI  - Immune response of buffaloes to vaccination with Brucella abortus strain 19.
PG  - 867-70
AB  - The immune response of buffalo calves and heifers to a full or half dose of 
      Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine was studied. Buffalo calves developed high 
      serum agglutination test (SAT) titres following full dose vaccination. These 
      titres declined more rapidly in calves of six months of age than in calves of 
      eleven to twelve months of age. Specific immunoglobulin G titres, as measured by 
      2-mercaptoethanol-treated serum agglutination, declined much earlier than SAT 
      titres. Buffalo heifers vaccinated with a full or half dose developed high SAT 
      titres. The rate of decline of SAT titres in heifers was much slower than in 
      calves. Vaccination with a half dose did not appear to offer any advantage in 
      terms of disappearance of SAT titres.

TI  - Genetic analysis of fragile X-syndrome.
PG  - 174-6
AB  - Fragile X-syndrome is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation. The 
      key clinical features of the fragile X-syndrome in males are mental retardation, 
      a long face with large everted ears and large testes. The disorder is associated 
      with a visible fragile site at Xq27.3 at FMR-1 loucs with the amplification of 
      (CGC) n repeat sequence. The early diagnosis of affected individuals are carriers 
      who are not aware of their high risk of having an affected child is important for 
      proper management and counselling.

TI  - Prevalence and severity of dental fluorosis in Al-Qaseem province--Kingdom of 
      Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 44-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the oral health status, especially prevalence and severity 
      of dental fluorosis among an urban and rural population of Al-Qaseem province. 
      DESIGN: World Health Organization (WHO) oral health form was used to survey the 
      population. SETTING: Subjects were surveyed from Urban and rural schools, 
      Government and non-governmental organizations, administrative and training 
      institutes of Buraida city and villages of Ain Al-Juwa and Al-Asiah. SUBJECTS: 
      Eight hundred male subjects were surveyed in 12, 15, 35-44 and > 65 years age 
      groups. Four hundred urban and four hundred rural subjects were examined. One 
      hundred in each group. RESULTS: It was found that fluorosis is more prevalent in 
      rural than urban population. 24-67 percent of 12, 15, 34-44 and > 65 years were 
      with dental fluorosis both in urban and rural areas. 12.5 percent of the 
      population examined were with moderate to severe dental fluorosis. Eight percent 
      of the urban and 16.3% of rural population were with moderate to severe dental 
      fluorosis. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Rural population have more prevalent 
      and severe dental fluorosis as compared to urban population of Al-Qaseem 
      province. There is a need of preventive oral health programs with community 
      education on their diet and water consumption. There is a need to improve water 
      supplies and defluoridation of water sources in affected areas. Multiple sources 
      of fluoride should be analysed and prevented. From treatment need point of view, 
      there is also a need to meet the increased demand of cosmetic restorations for 
      aesthetic units of dentition.

TI  - Evaluation of genotoxic potential of synthetic progestins-norethindrone and 
      norgestrel in human lymphocytes in vitro.
PG  - 13-20
AB  - The genotoxicity study of two widely used contraceptive synthetic progestins, 
      i.e. norgestrel and norethindrone was carried out on human lymphocyte chromosomes 
      using chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) and cell 
      growth kinetics as parameters. The study was carried out both in the presence as 
      well as in the absence of metabolic activation (S(9) mix). The lymphocytes were 
      exposed to three different concentrations of the drugs (20, 40 and 75 microg/ml 
      for norethindrone and 10, 25 and 50 microg/ml for norgestrel) for three different 
      durations (24, 48 and 72 h). The drug norethindrone was found to be non-genotoxic 
      at any concentration and at any exposure duration either in the presence or in 
      the absence of S(9) mix. But another drug norgestrel was found to affect the 
      genetic material. It induces CA, SCE at significant level, and inhibits 
      lymphocyte proliferation at 25 and 50 microg/ml of concentrations only. In the 
      presence of S(9) mix the values obtained for CA, SCE and mitotic index (MI) were 
      more significant. A time and dose relationship was also observed. It was 
      concluded that norgestrel itself and possibly its metabolites are potent mutagens 
      beyond a particular dose in human lymphocytes.

PG  - 493-8
AB  - When Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from the 
      Kuwaiti desert, was incubated with exogenous progesterone for 24 h, three 
      monohydroxylated metabolites were produced. 20alpha-Hydroxyprogesterone was the 
      major metabolite produced in 60.8 relative percentage yield. The other two 
      monohydroxylated metabolites were identified as 6beta-hydroxyprogesterone and the 
      rare 6alpha-hydroxyprogesterone in 21.0 and 13.6 relative percentage yields, 
      respectively. A new metabolite 9,10-seco-4-pregnene-3,9,20-trione was isolated in 
      3.7 relative percentage yield. All metabolites were purified by preparative TLC 
      and HPLC followed by their identification using 1H, 13C NMR and other 
      spectroscopic data.

TI  - Lymphadenopathy in adults. A clinicopathological analysis.
PG  - 282-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinicopathological features of patients admitted to 
      adult wards with a primary presenting feature of lymphadenopathy. METHODS: A 
      retrospective study of all patients admitted to Riyadh Medical Complex, Riyadh, 
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between April 1996 through to March 2000. RESULTS: The 
      patients mean age was 35.2 years (standard deviation 15.7 years) and 59.5% were 
      females while 56.2% were Saudis. Swelling was the primary presenting symptom in 
      39.3% of the patients, while fever, night sweats, and pain occurred in 17.3%, 
      10.3% and 8.5% patients. There was considerable overlap between benign and 
      malignant causes of lymphadenopathy but in 56.6% of patients, lymphadenopathy was 
      the only sign. The cervical group of lymph nodes was the most commonly affected 
      site. Hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and both organ enlargement occurred in 59 
      (22.9%) patients. The presence of generalized lymphadenopathy and other physical 
      signs (serositis and organomegaly) highly suggested a malignant process. 
      Granulomatous lymphadenopathy due to tuberculosis was the most frequent pattern 
      98 (37.9%) followed by lymphoma 85 (32.9%). Tuberculosis was also more common in 
      females than males (51% versus 19%). Among patients with Hodgkin's disease, 
      nodular sclerosis was the most frequent (75%). Routine investigations did not 
      discriminate between benign and malignant causes of lymphadenopathy. The overall 
      mortality rate was 8.1%: with metastatic disease accounting for 52.4%. 
      CONCLUSION: There were significant similarities and differences between these 
      findings and other previous studies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and elsewhere.

TI  - Mean ages at parities: an indirect estimation.
PG  - 545-61
AB  - "The objective of this paper is to describe an indirect approach for estimating 
      the age patterns of occurrence of birth by parity. The main concern here is not 
      of estimating the frequency of occurrence of births (in a period of time) in 
      relation to the population (birth rate) or in relation to the number of females 
      (fertility). Rather, the focus here is on the ages of first, second, and 
      subsequent births, and on their shifts over time. Essentially, the approach is an 
      extension of Hajnal's method for using proportions single to estimate singulate 
      mean age at marriage...." The approach is illustrated using data from the 1975 
      Pakistan Fertility Survey and the 1990-1991 Pakistan Demographic and Health 
      Survey. A comment by Sultan S. Hashmi is included (pp. 560-1).

TI  - Additive action of vitamins C and E against hydrocortisone-induced genotoxicity 
      in human lymphocyte chromosomes.
PG  - 204-9
AB  - In earlier reports, hydrocortisone administration to human lymphocytes in culture 
      was shown to cause chromosomal aberrations and increased sister chromatid 
      exchanges. With a view to study the ameliorative action of some antioxidants 
      against this effect, vitamins C and E were used separately and in combination 
      along with hydrocortisone treatment, at different dosage and for different 
      durations, on human lymphocyte cultures. The levels of chromosomal aberrations 
      and sister chromatid exchanges were lowered, suggesting a protective role of 
      vitamins against genotoxic damage. Administration of vitamins C and E combined 
      appeared to be more effective in preventing chromosomal damage than separate 
      administration, demonstrating the additive action of these vitamins against 
      steroid-induced genotoxicity.

OAB - An exploratory study of 700 ever-married women was conducted in a suburb of 
      Lahore city in 1973 in an attempt to gather knowledge concerning the major 
      determinants of fertility and family size. A retrospective sample survey was used 
      for collecting the data. From the sample of 700, average age at marriage has been 
      computed for the females getting married during different periods of time. The 
      mean age at marriage shows an increasing trend from decade to decade, and these 
      increases have been found to be statistically significant. Of the 700 women, 674 
      have actually been pregnant and in this group there were 3691 pregnancies, an 
      average of 5.5 pregnancies per woman. The total number of pregnancy wastages 
      among these women was 174 or 47/1000 pregnancies. The total number of children 
      ever born to these mothers was 3531 or an average of 5.2 children per mother. The 
      overall average number of children born alive to the mothers whose age at 
      marriage was under 15 is 5.4; for those married at the average age of 15, the 
      number of children is 5; and for those with higher ages at marriage, the number 
      of children ranges from 4.4 to 4.6. The marital age-specific fertility rate is 
      slightly higher for the age group 15-19 but is lower for the ages 30 and above. 
      The relationship of cumulative number of pregnancies and the number of pregnancy 
      wastages experienced shows that the pregnancies of m others increase with more 
      pregnancy wastages, but the average number for those who never experienced a loss 
      was also high. This suggests that the use of contraception has not been 
      sufficiently extensive to help limit the incidence of pregnancies. The patterns 
      of cumulative fertility also suggest that the family planning program has done 
      little to reduce fertility. A comparison of the average number of children ever 
      born to the 700 women with that provided by the National Impact Survey shows 
      little change over the 5 years intervening between the 2 studies.

OAB - The Population Growth Estimation (PGE) experiment yielded 3 series of fertility 
      and mortality rate estimates for Pakistan and Bangladesh for 1962-1965: 1) the 
      series based on longitudinal registration (LR); 2) the estimates based on the 
      cross-sectional survey (CS); and 3) the Chandra-Deming (CD) estimates obtained 
      through the matching of LR and CS. The CD estimates were inflated because, while 
      the numerator was adjusted for underregistration and underenumeration, the 
      denominator remained unadjusted. Almost constant relative differences of about 
      20% were found between the CD and LR estimates. To work out the 
      denominator-adjusted PGE birth and death rates, the present study used the ratio 
      of births to deaths, not their absolute numbers. The resulting 
      denominator-adjusted CD crude birth rates for both Pakistan and Bangladesh were 
      46, compared with the unadjusted rates of 52 and 53, respectively. Similar 
      adjustments in LR rates have yielded vital rates of almost the same order of the 
      CD rates, supporting the validity of this approach. The rates obtained provide a 
      more realistic basis for preparing population projections. Incorporation of 
      similar adjustments in the age-specific mortality rates can lead to a revised set 
      of life tables, and the age distribution of the 1972 census can be used with the 
      estimates of fertility and mortality obtained in the present study to project 
      vital rates for the 2 countries. In addition, the adjusted estimates of the crude 
      birth rate and age-specific fertility rate provide more realistic benchmarks for 
      evaluating the impact of Pakistan's family planning program. Future PGE-type 
      projects can provide realistic fertility and mortality estimates if 1) the 
      registration and enumeration of vital events are accurate enough to yield the 
      correct ratios of the number of births and deaths; and 2) the population counts 
      in at least the initial and terminal years of the experiment are of the same 
      degree of accuracy, so as to yield a correct average rate of population growth.

OAB - This paper draws upon a group of demographic surveys to provide direct and 
      indirect estimates of infant and child mortality risks in Pakistan for the period 
      1962-1986. Differentials and trends in the estimates are subsequently explored. 
      The 1962-65 Population Growth Estimation (PGE), the 1968-71 and 1976-79 
      Population Growth Surveys (PGS), the 1984-86 Pakistan Demographic Surveys, the 
      1975 Pakistan Fertility Surveys (PFS), the 1979-80 Population, Labor Force and 
      Migration Survey (PLM), and the 1984-85 Pakistan Contraceptive Prevalence Survey 
      were the sources used for the study. Results indicate that infant and child 
      mortality rates are declining, with male-female differentials in child mortality 
      risks also growing less marked. Both of these observations were more pronounced 
      in urban areas. The importance of both mothers' education and improved rural 
      living conditions in reducing the risk of child mortality is stressed in the 
      paper.

OAB - This study of marriage patterns is concerned with marriages registered during the 
      years 1964 and 1969 in the Kharianwala, Salar Syyedan, and Kot Ranjeet, Union 
      Councils of Sheikhupura District consisting of 23 villages. The Muslim Family Law 
      of 1961 requiring registration of marriages provides a direct source of marriage 
      statistics and has been the data base for this study. Results have been compared 
      with the PIDE Karachi study and with the Lahore study and changes in marriage 
      patterns are examined over a 5-year period. Findings show that women continued to 
      marry at age 19 in both urban and rural areas. Rural men married at an average 
      age of 22.6 in 1969 and 22.4 in 1964. In 1964 men in Karachi married at an 
      average age of 25.4; in Lahore in 1969 average age was 24.4. There was no change 
      in age over time in the rural areas but in Karachi the average age of the male at 
      marriage increased from 24.6 in 1962 to 25.4 in 1965. This difference can be 
      accounted for by the additional time spent in school and in working for economic 
      independence. The fact that the age of the female has remained the same at time 
      of marriage means that 30 years of fertility can be expected for her after 
      marriage. According to the 1972 census, family planning programs have been 
      ineffective. There is an obvious need to increase the age at marriage for women. 
      This will require a change in traditional custom. Regarding the practice of 
      "mehr," the rural population studies do not reveal a positive relationship 
      between the age at marriage and the average "mehr" as is observed for Karachi and 
      Lahore. A high "mehr" is essential in Karachi and to some extent in Lahore, but 
      this is not so in rural areas where protection is provided by the traditional 
      social pressures. The study also indicates that rural to urban migration of women 
      has increased from 6.6% to 16% between 1964 and 1969, meaning that more 
      population distribution occurs between rural and urban areas because of marriage.

OAB - In a Lahore Suburb, Pakistan the attempt is made to study fertility in relation 
      to infant-child mortality and the differentials in the level of fertility and 
      child mortality by income level, by educational levels of mothers and of fathers, 
      and by some relevant demographic variables. Multiple regression was done in an 
      effort to obtain an understanding of the influence of selected independent 
      variables, both collectively and i ndividually, in explaining the variations in 
      the dependent variables of children ever born and mortality of children. The 
      results of the analysis reveal that those mothers who had completed their 
      reproductive periods or were on the verge of completion, on the average, lost 
      nearly 2 children up until that time. Despite the sex of the deceased child, when 
      a child dies there is a desire for more children. The results of the study do not 
      support the hypothesis that fertility is higher when there are son deaths as 
      compared to daughter deaths. The results reveal a positive association between 
      children ever born and the number of child deaths, yet the evidence itself is 
      inadequate to suggest whether the higher number of children ever born is the 
      cause or effect of deaths of children, because with a higher number of children 
      ever born a woman is likely to have more child deaths even if the risk of 
      mortality is the same. The differences observed between the multiple regression 
      analysis for children ever born and mortality of children points toward the very 
      important roles of income level in limiting child mortality and higher 
      educational level of mother in limiting the number of children ever born to the 
      sample of mothers under study.

OAB - Rapidly increasing population growth in developing countries, as well as efforts 
      to promote socioeconomic development, have led to an awareness of the need for 
      the collection of data for demographic analysis. The overall objective of such 
      assessment is a systematic analysis of demographic parameters in order to 
      determine population trends and their interaction with social and economic 
      variables of concern to policy makers. The lack of adequate census and vital 
      registration systems in many developing countries has led to the use of sample 
      surveys and other methods for indirect estimation of population dynamics. 
      Although sample surveys have been useful in providing independent insights into 
      population dynamics, the census continues to be a major source of demographic and 
      socioeconomic information in developing countries because of its comprehensive 
      cross-sectional view. The potential for improvement in data collection and 
      analysis is actually greater in countries with little experience in demographic 
      assessment than in countries with more experience where a high margin of error 
      has become institutionalized in the data base. In countries such as Africa, where 
      demographic sources are limited, extra effort is essential to produce demographic 
      estimates that can serve as benchmarks. The validity of estimates can always be 
      improved by consolidating data from both censuses and population surveys.

OAB - Data were collected on the occurrence of marriages between close relatives, 
      including cousins, as well as between nonrelatives from 6611 ever married women 
      as part of the 1990-91 Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS). The 
      patterns of age at marriage, fertility, child mortality, and urban and rural 
      residence would help authenticate the hypothesis that genetic risks to child 
      health are higher among children of parents closely related. The PDHS indicated 
      that more than half of ever married women aged 15-49 were married to their first 
      cousins. The inclusion of second cousins raised the percentage of consanguineous 
      marriages from 50.3 to 61.2. Another 1.3% were married to other relations and the 
      rest (over 37%) were married to non-relatives. The PDHS also showed that compared 
      to the women who married at 18 years of age, the percentage of those who were 
      married to first cousins was slightly lower among those married at older ages. 
      Distinct urban-rural differentials emerged. In the urban areas the marriages to 
      cousins amounted to 51.3% and 53.1% when other relatives were also counted. In 
      contrast, 65.6% and 66.9%, respectively, were the figures in rural areas. First 
      cousin marriages were higher in the provinces of Baluchistan and Punjab (53% and 
      54.4%, respectively) than those in Sindh (49.7%) and the North-West Frontier 
      Province (38.8%). Among females the educational status was important with respect 
      to marriages to first cousins: 52.2% had no education, 48.9% had primary 
      education, 43.1% had middle level education, and 32.5% had secondary education. 
      The mean age at marriage of women where the spouse was the cousin was less than 
      when they were married to others. The PDHS demonstrated that only 1.3% of ever 
      married women aged 15-49 were divorced or separated. In addition, child mortality 
      was higher for women married to cousins than those married to others. Child 
      morbidity was also somewhat higher among these marriages, except for those living 
      in urban areas, where the reverse was true. This peculiarity requires further 
      study of the problem of consanguinity.

OAB - Data on children ever born from surveys conducted between 1984 and 1988 provide 
      evidence for fertility decline in Pakistan and little evidence for a "zig zag" 
      pattern of variations in the levels of the birth rate reported in surveys 
      conducted between 1962 and 1988. This study is concerned with the indirect 
      estimation of the crude birth rate (CBR). Input data is available on age specific 
      mortality and the age distribution of the population. CBR was calculated on the 
      basis of the life table method. The estimation of CBR from 1962-65 to 1979 
      revealed a declining trend, which also appeared in estimations based on survey 
      data after 1979. Estimation of CBR based on infant and child mortality risks 
      showed declining trends through 1979, a slight elevation in infant mortality in 
      1984, and then decline followed by a higher increase in 1988. The increased risk 
      of infant mortality was interpreted as an artifact of the data. Further analysis 
      of the correlation between infant and child mortality risks in the ordinary least 
      squares equations indicated that 50% of the variation in infant mortality risk 
      was explained by child mortality risk variation between 1962 and 1979. The 
      adjusted values were then used to estimate mortality between 1984 and 1988, which 
      indicated similar values (91/1000 births) as the 1990-91 survey data. In the 
      ordinary least squares examination of the association between child mortality 
      risks and the estimates of crude birth rates between 1962 and 1979, the finding 
      was that 70% of the variation in the values of CBR were explained by variations 
      in child mortality risks. The indirect estimation for 1984 to 1988 however showed 
      elevated CBR, which was construed to be due to increased infant mortality risks, 
      which may be in error. When CBR was estimated using the proportions in the 
      population aged 0-4 years and mortality risk, the life table estimates showed a 
      reduced rate by 3.3 for 1984 and by 1.1 for 1988, and with other substitutions, 
      lower CBR. The conclusion from the exploration of different methods of 
      calculating was that CBR may be even lower that 37/1000, and the rate of natural 
      increase may be lower than 2.7%.

TI  - Effect of environmental pollutants on hepatocellular function in rats: 
      3-methylcholanthrene and Aroclor-1254.
PG  - 283-99
AB  - Environmental pollutants, Aroclor-1254 (PCB) and 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), were 
      employed in this study to investigate some aspects of the induction of hepatic 
      drug metabolism in rats. PCB and MC treatments increased 7-ethoxyresorufin and 
      7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase activities related to cytochrome P-448. Cytochrome 
      P-450 reductase activity was increased by PCB while no effect was observed by MC 
      treatment. Pretreatment with PCB resulted in approximately 50% increase in the 
      phospholipid content of the microsomes whereas MC caused no change. Liver 
      microsomal cholesterol content was decreased while triglycerides were increased 
      by PCB. The ratio between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (saturation 
      index) decreased in the total microsomes and phospholipids with PCB treatment, 
      whereas MC did not alter the ratio, except that the major effect of MC was 
      observed in the acyl derivatives of microsomal phosphatidylethanolamine. It is 
      proposed that the uniaxial rotation and mobility of hemoproteins may be 
      restricted by an increase in the saturation index of the membrane, while a 
      decreased index may facilitate contact with reductases for electron transfer by 
      enhanced membrane fluidity. The decreased saturation index after treatment with 
      MC may play a role in carcinogenicity by triggering induction of free radicals.

TI  - Modulation of bile acids induced by paraquat in rabbits.
PG  - 301-15
AB  - Rabbit bile was examined for changes in composition induced by paraquat. Paraquat 
      was administered intraperitoneally and changes in bile components were monitored 
      by high performance liquid chromatography. Alterations in the ratios of total 
      glycine/taurine conjugated bile acids (TGC/TTC), cholic acid/deoxycholic acid 
      (CA/DC), cholic acid/chenodeoxycholic acid (CA/CDC) and cholic acid/cholesterol 
      (CA/CH) were measured as an index of paraquat toxicity. A statistically 
      significant increase in the ratio of TGC/TTC was observed, while CA/DC, CA/CDC 
      and CA/CH showed a decrease. Phospholipids, protein, sugar, bilirubin, 
      beta-carotene, vitamin A and vitamin E in the bile and serum of the experimental 
      animals were also monitored. In bile, the levels of cholesterol, phospholipids, 
      protein, sugar, and total bile acids increased while the levels of the 
      antioxidants beta-carotene, vitamin A and vitamin E decreased. A decrease in the 
      bilirubin content of the bile was also observed. These modifications may be 
      useful clinically for assessment of paraquat toxicity.

TI  - Studies on Bacillus stearothermophilus. Part II. Transformation of progesterone.
PG  - 251-6
AB  - Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from Kuwaiti 
      desert, when incubated with exogenous progesterone for 10 days at 65 degrees C 
      produced two new dihydroxy isomers of progesterone, and two known compounds, 5 
      alpha-pregnane-3,6,20-trione and 6-dehydroprogesterone, along with the earlier 
      reported monohydroxylated metabolites and a B-Seco compound. The two new 
      dihydroxy compounds were identified as 6 alpha,20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone and 
      6 beta,20 alpha-dihydroxyprogesterone. These metabolites were purified by TLC and 
      HPLC followed by their identification through 1H, 13C NMR and other spectroscopic 
      data.

TI  - The prevalence of silent kidney stones--an ultrasonographic screening study.
PG  - 24-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Silent and not yet discovered stones of the upper urinary tract are 
      potentially dangerous, since in due course they may cause infection, obstruction 
      and renal damage. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of such 
      silent kidney stones in a representative Pakistani population of Karachi. 
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We studied 201 consecutive subjects at our hospital who 
      underwent additional kidney screening whilst undergoing abdominal ultrasound. All 
      these subjects did not have a history or symptoms of urolithiasis. RESULT: We 
      found silent kidney stones in 3% of subjects. All stone bearers were males. Most 
      stones were in the left kidney. Notably, multiple stones and stones of a 
      considerable size went unnoticed. CONCLUSION: In addition to the usual figures of 
      incidence and prevalence of stone disease drawn from patient data, there is a 
      prevalence of 3% silent stones that may only be discovered incidentally or by 
      screening. This is true for a "'stone country" like Pakistan. Figures for other 
      regions have yet to be determined. Due to socioeconomic reasons, we believe that 
      a general kidney screening for urolithiasis is, however, not indicated, at least 
      in our country.

AB  - Galactosemia is a rare metabolic disorder. It has good prognosis, if detected in 
      neonatal period or early infancy. Two cases of classic galactosemia are 
      presented. One case was detected in neonatal period. Early intervention has led 
      to normal development till now. The second case was diagnosed at 1 year of age. 
      Elimination of milk from diet is quite simple and effective treatment modality.

TI  - Method to overcome photoreaction, a serious drawback to the use of 
      dichlorofluorescin in evaluation of reactive oxygen species.
PG  - 619-24
AB  - Non-fluorescent dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) was converted to fluorescent products 
      by photo-irradiation during observations with spectrofluorometer and fluorescence 
      microscopy. Photo-irradiation of DCFH at 250, 300, 330, 400, 500, or 600 nm 
      generated fluorescent dichlorofluorescein (DCF), an oxidation product of DCFH, 
      and an unrecognized fluorescent product. The ratio of the unknown product to DCF 
      varied from 0.15 to 8.21 depending on wavelength. Although reactive oxygen 
      species scavengers, such as catalase, superoxide dismutase, and sodium azide, did 
      not suppress the increase in non-specified fluorescence, reagents such as 
      ascorbic acid, mercaptopropionyl glycine, and methoxycinnamic acid, in a 
      cell-free system, almost completely suppressed it with little effect on the 
      fluorescence of DCF. Meanwhile, ascorbic acid also suppressed non-specified 
      fluorescence in cells, but not completely. At low concentrations of DCFH, the 
      speed of increasing fluorescence was considerably retarded, to such a degree that 
      the fluorescence increase in cells during fluorescence microscopic observation 
      was negligible. The addition, at the time of evaluation, of the above reagents to 
      cell-free systems and, in cell systems, reducing the concentration of DCFH, 
      effectively suppressed the photoreaction of DCFH.

TI  - Studies on Bacillus stearothermophilus. Part III. Transformation of testosterone.
PG  - 48-52
AB  - Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from the Kuwaiti 
      desert, produced a variety of monohydroxy androstene derivatives and an oxidized 
      product when incubated with exogenous testosterone for 24 h at 65 degrees C. The 
      major metabolite was identified as androst-4-en-3,17-dione while minor 
      metabolites included 6 alpha-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3,17-dione, 6 
      beta-hydroxyandrost-4-en-3,17-dione, 6 alpha-hydroxytestosterone, and 6 
      beta-hydroxytestosterone. These metabolites were purified by TLC and HPLC 
      followed by their identification using (1)H- and (13)C-NMR and other 
      spectroscopic data.

TI  - Accumulation of trace metals in aquatic insect Stenopsyche marmorata Navas 
      transferred in streams.
PG  - 256-64
AB  - Instar V larvae of the aquatic insect Stenopsyche marmorata were transferred 
      between a noncontaminated site and a contaminated site and changes in the 
      accumulation of nickel (Ni), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb) in larvae were 
      monitored for 30 days. Concentrations of the four metals rapidly increased or 
      decreased within 10 days in the transferred larvae and approached concentrations 
      of the native larvae living in the transfer sites. The accumulation of Ni and Cu 
      in the larval body was very noticeable. The decreased Ni concentrations are 
      represented by two exponential rate formulas, suggesting a biological half-life 
      of 1.4 and 12.1 days. Under laboratory conditions, routes of Ni and Cu uptake 
      were examined and Ni uptake was found to be mainly from food. However, larvae 
      accumulated Cu from both food and water sources. In this case, the amount of 
      metal uptake from food was more than that from water. The results of this indoor 
      experiment are discussed and compared with the results of the transfer field 
      experiment. Active biomonitoring of trace metal in transferred larvae is useful 
      since it enables rapid and easy assessment of metal contamination.

TI  - The immune response of guinea pigs and buffalo calves to the locally prepared 
      Brucella abortus strain 19 vaccine.
PG  - 893-7
AB  - Brucella abortus vaccine was prepared from strain 19 imported from Germany. The 
      vaccine induced a good immune response in guinea pigs as evidenced by a 
      serological titre of 328 international units (IU)/ml 10 days post-vaccination. 
      Vaccinated guinea pigs also withstood an experimental challenge of 5,000 
      colony-forming units of a locally isolated virulent B. abortus strain. This 
      vaccine, containing 7 x 10(10) viable organisms, induced a significant immune 
      response in 8 to 10.5 month old female buffalo calves. Significant serum 
      agglutination test (SAT) titres were seen on day 7 following vaccination. The 
      highest SAT titres were observed on day 14 post-vaccination and the titres 
      started declining thereafter. The rate of decrease was slow from day 14 to day 49 
      post-vaccination; however, a rapid decrease in titres was seen from day 49 to day 
      91 post-vaccination. Negligible SAT titres were observed on day 91 
      post-vaccination. Specific immunoglobulin G titres, as measured by 
      2-mercaptoethanol treated SAT, also followed a similar trend and the titre of all 
      five of the calves that were vaccinated became zero on day 91 post-vaccination.

TI  - Antigenotoxic effect of allicin against SCEs induced by methyl methanesulphonate 
      in cultured mammalian cells.
PG  - 437-8
AB  - Allicin, one of the sulphur compounds of garlic (Allium sativum), possesses 
      antioxidant and thiol disulphide exchange activity and is also shown to cause a 
      variety of activities potentially useful for human health. In this investigation, 
      the effect of 1,5,10 and 20 microM of allicin was determined for inhibiting the 
      rate of SCE induced by 60 microM of MMS. Cultured human lymphocytes from two 
      female donors were used for the experiment. The levels of SCEs were lowered by 
      allicin suggesting its antigenotoxic activity in mammalian cells in vitro.

TI  - Vicia faba as a bioindicator of oil pollution.
PG  - 213-7
AB  - In 1990, the Gulf War caused an unprecedented environmental catastrophe. More 
      than 700 oil wells were set on fire, emitting thousands of tons of oxides of 
      nitrogen, sulfur, soot and oil mist at high temperatures. The blazing oil wells 
      and lakes were the major cause of environmental pollution, damaging flora and 
      fauna throughout Kuwait and the surrounding region. We set up this study in order 
      to investigate whether Vicia faba could be used as a bioindicator of oil 
      pollution. Growth parameters of Vicia faba, such as levels of photosynthetic 
      pigments, proteins, free amino acids, phenols, sugars, biomass, moisture and 
      fatty acids, were studied. Levels of total reducible sugars, phenols, proteins, 
      free amino acids and proline were found to be higher in plants grown in 
      hydrocarbon-polluted soil, compared to those grown in control soil. However, 
      biomass, moisture, pheophytin, the 435/415 nm ratio for chlorophylls and the 
      chlorophyll a/carotenoid ratio, were higher in the plants grown in control soil 
      than those grown in polluted soil. Our results indicate that Vicia faba can be 
      used as a bioindicator of pollution and a ratio of the fatty acid C(20:1)/C(18:1) 
      is an important index of environmental oil pollution.

TI  - Diuretic and nephroprotective effect of Jawarish Zarooni Sada--a polyherbal unani 
      formulation.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - A number of drugs, both single and compound preparations are used widely in 
      Tibb-e-Unani (Unani medicine) in the management of renal diseases. But such drugs 
      mostly, have not been investigated for their described effects. Jawarish Zarooni 
      Sada (JZS) is one such polyherbal preparation containing 15 ingredients, mainly 
      described to be diuretic and nephroprotective. Therefore, in the present study 
      ethanol and water extracts of JZS (300 mg each) were investigated for diuretic 
      activity by measuring the total urine output over a period of 6h. Sodium and 
      potassium level in urine sample was also estimated. Nephroprotective activity of 
      JZS against gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity was investigated by administering 
      JZS along with high dose of gentamicin (40 mg/kg) and elevation of serum urea and 
      serum creatinine was taken as the index of nephrotoxicity. JZS showed significant 
      diuretic and nephroprotective effect.

TI  - Chronic orchidectomy does not influence the sensitivity of the pituitary 
      somatotropes to varying doses of GHRH administered intravenously to the adult 
      male rhesus monkey.
PG  - 1041-50
AB  - In the present study, the pituitary growth hormone (GH) response to graded doses 
      of GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) was determined in intact (n = 3) and chronically 
      orchidectomized (n = 3) adult rhesus monkeys (Mucaca mulatta). GHRH in doses of 
      0, 6.25, 12.5 and 25 microg/kg BW was infused through a teflon cannula implanted 
      in the saphenous vein. Blood samples were collected 60 min before and 90 min 
      after the injection of the neurohormone at 15 min intervals. All bleedings were 
      carried out under ketamine hydrochloride anesthesia. The plasma levels of GH were 
      determined by using AutoDELFIA time-resolved flouroimmunoassay, whereas plasma 
      levels of testosterone and estradiol were determined using specific 
      radioimmunoassay systems. The GH responses to GHRH were not significantly 
      different between intact and chronically orchidectomized monkeys at any of the 
      dose levels tested (p > 0.05). The administration of GHRH resulted in a 
      significant (p < 0.05) stimulation of GH secretion at all the doses tested and in 
      both the groups studied. In both intact and orchidectomized animals, the greatest 
      response was observed at 6.25 microg/kg and no further increase was noted with 
      the higher doses of GHRH. In conclusion, the present study suggests that chronic 
      orchidectomy does not influence the sensitivity of the pituitary somatotropes to 
      GHRH stimulation implying that the responsiveness of the pituitary somatotropes 
      to GHRH is independent of testicular steroid modulation.

PG  - 221-5
AB  - The genotoxicity study of a synthetic progestin chlormadinone acetate, was 
      carried out on mouse bone marrow cells using sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) 
      and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) as parameter, chlormadinone acetate was studied 
      at three different doses, i.e. 5.62, 11.25 and 22.50 mg/kg body weight and was 
      found to be non-genotoxic at 5.62 mg/kg body weight. But at 11.25 and 22.50 mg/kg 
      of body weight chlormadinone acetate increases SCE (P < 0.001) and CA (P < 0.01) 
      at significant level compared to normal control. The results suggests a genotoxic 
      and cytotoxic effect of chlormadinone acetate in mouse bone marrow cells.

AB  - The genotoxicity of cyproterone acetate was studied in human lymphocytes using 
      chromosomal aberrations (CAs), mitotic index (MI) and sister chromatid exchanges 
      (SCEs) as a parameter. Cyproterone acetate was found to be genotoxic at 20 and 30 
      microM. To study the possible mechanism of the genotoxicity of cyproterone 
      acetate, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were used separately and 
      in combination along with the 30 microM of cyproterone acetate at different 
      doses. SOD treatment increases CAs, SCEs and decreases MI as compared to 
      treatment with 30 microM CPA alone, at both of the tested doses. CAT treatment 
      decreases the frequencies of CAs and SCEs and increases MI in both, as compared 
      to treatment with 30 microM CPA alone, separately and in combination with SOD, 
      suggesting a possible role of reactive oxygen species for the genotoxic damage.

AB  - The antigenotoxic effect of some phytoproducts like carotenoid (beta-carotene), 
      curcumin, ascorbic acid and flavonoid (genistein)was demonstrated on the 
      genotoxicity induced by hydrocortisone. Human lymphocyte cultures were studied 
      for the induction of chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and 
      effect on cell cycle kinetics with or without the presence of metabolic 
      activation (S9 mix). The phytoproducts were studied in two most effective doses 
      viz. carotenoid (0.5 and 0.7 microM), curcumin (15 and 25 microM), ascorbic acid 
      (60 and 80 microM) and flavonoid (25 and 40 microM) in 24, 48 and 72 h cultures, 
      and they were found to reduce chromosomal aberrations, sister chromatid exchange 
      and increase replication index. The present study showed that the ascorbic acid 
      and curcumin were more effective than carotenoid and flavonoid, though all 
      provide protection against the genotoxicity of hydrocortisone.

TI  - Lens lipids and maximum lifespan.
PG  - 761-8
AB  - Unlike in most organs, the lipid composition of lenses varies dramatically among 
      species and with age. The focus of this study is to assess how these changes 
      relate to lifespan. Studies on cataract suggest that the lens may serve as a 
      window into the processes leading to accelerated mortality. As a first step 
      toward elucidating cellular processes in the lens that may serve as markers for 
      accelerated mortality, we examined the correlation between species-dependent and 
      age-related lens lipid compositional differences and maximum life span. We 
      included data from camels, which, even in old age, rarely develop cataracts 
      although they live under adverse conditions. Camel lens lipids were mainly 
      composed of sphingolipids (77%) and phosphatidylcholines (23%). Bovine lens lipid 
      composition was comparable to a previous study, and both bovine lens 
      sphingolipids, phosphatidylcholines and camel lens phosphatidylcholines content 
      fit well (within the 95% confidence limits) in the curve obtained by plotting 
      maximum life spans of other species with sphingolipids and phosphatidylcholines. 
      Lifespan was directly related to lens sphingolipid content and indirectly related 
      to lens phosphatidylcholine content. The camel lens sphingolipid value was 
      significantly above the curve for other species. Except for the camel lens 
      nucleus, lipid order and sphingolipid content were linearly related, p < 0.005 
      with a slope of 0.85+/-0.07, and intercept of 6.9+/-3.8. Lipid phase transition 
      temperature and sphingolipid content were also linearly related, p = 0.01 with a 
      slope of 0.20+/-0.07, and intercept of 21.7+/-5.3. Our data support the 
      hypothesis that humans have adapted so that their lens membranes have a high 
      sphingolipid content that confers resistance to oxidation, allowing these 
      membranes to stay clear for a relatively longer time than is the case in many 
      other species. Age-related changes in human lens lipid composition may serve as a 
      marker for oxidative stress and may reflect systemic oxidative insult, providing 
      a window into the health of an individual.

TI  - Genotoxic potential of ethinylestradiol in cultured mammalian cells.
PG  - 133-41
AB  - Ethinylestradiol, a steroidal estrogen, is widely used with various progestogens 
      in oral contraceptives formulations. There are sufficient evidences for the 
      carcinogenicity of ethinylestradiol in experimental animals. The reports on the 
      genotoxic potential of ethinylestradiol are contradictory. Here in the present 
      study we have tested the genotoxicity of ethinylestradiol in human lymphocytes 
      using chromosomal aberrations (CAs), mitotic index (MI) and sister chromatid 
      exchanges (SCEs) as a parameter. The study was carried out in the absence, as 
      well as in the presence, of rat liver microsomal fraction, with and without NADP. 
      Ethinylestradiol was studied at three different concentrations (1, 5 and 10 
      microM) and was found non-genotoxic in the absence of metabolic activation (S9 
      mix) and in S9 mix without NADP. Ethinylestradiol was found to be genotoxic at 5 
      and 10 microM in the presence of S9 mix with NADP. To study the possible 
      mechanism of the genotoxicity of ethinylestradiol, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and 
      catalase (CAT) were used separately and in combination along with 10 microM of 
      ethinylestradiol at different doses. SOD treatment increased CAs and SCEs and 
      decreases MI as compared with treatment with 10 microM of ethinylestradiol alone 
      in the presence of S9 mix with NADP at both of the tested doses. CAT treatment 
      decreased the frequencies of CAs and SCEs and increased MI, as compared with 
      treatment with 10 microM of ethinylestradiol alone in the presence of S9 mix with 
      NADP. CAT treatment in combination with SOD also decreased the frequencies of CAs 
      and SCEs and increased MI suggesting a possible role of reactive oxygen species 
      for the genotoxic damage.

TI  - Economic burden of hepatitis C in Canada and the potential impact of prevention. 
      Results from a disease model.
PG  - 159-65
AB  - This Canadian hepatitis C model estimates economic burden of disease using Markov 
      modeling to predict progression over 11 health states annually from 2001 to 2040. 
      Incidence-based estimates help demonstrate the capability to determine 
      cost-effectiveness of programs to prevent different proportions of incident 
      cases. Benefits of prevention increase linearly with the number of incident cases 
      prevented. The model forecasts annual health care costs for the treatment of 
      HCV-related disease ranging from $103 to $158 million over time. Health care 
      costs attributable to 2001 incidence cohort are forecast at $14.6 million for 
      prevention. The increasing cost of HCV provides a framework for further analysis 
      and implementation of long-term policies aimed at appropriate allocation of 
      resources for health in Canada.

TI  - Studies on Bacillus stearothermophilus. Part IV. Influence of enhancers on 
      biotransformation of testosterone.
PG  - 327-33
AB  - The impact of chemical enhancers on the biotransformation of testosterone has 
      been exploited. Application of crude cell concentrates to produce Bacillus 
      stearothermophilus-mediated bioconversion of testosterone at 65 degrees C for 72 
      h has been examined. After incubation, the xenobiotic substrate was added to the 
      concentrated whole cell suspensions. The enhancer molecules were included in the 
      whole cell suspension. The resultant products, after extraction into an organic 
      solvent, were purified by thin layer chromatography and identification was 
      carried out through spectroscopic data. Five steroid metabolites 
      9,10-seco-4-androstene-3,9,17-trione, 5alpha-androstan-3,6,17-trione, 
      17beta-hydroxy-5alpha-androstan-3,6-dione, 
      3beta,17beta-dihydroxyandrost-4-ene-6-one and 
      17beta-hydroxyandrost-4,6-diene-3-one were identified as biotransformation 
      products of testosterone. A possible biosynthetic route for these bioconversion 
      products is postulated.

TI  - In vivo induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal 
      aberrations (CAs) by lynestrenol.
PG  - 291-3
AB  - Genotoxicity study of synthetic progestin lynestrenol, was carried out on mouse 
      bone marrow cells using sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal 
      aberrations (CAs) as parameters. Lynestrenol was studied at three different doses 
      (6.87, 13.75 and 27.50 mg/kg body wt.). SCE and CA increased significantly as 
      compared to normal control when treated with lynestrenol at 13.75 and 27.50 mg/kg 
      body wt. The present results suggest that lynestrenol has both a genotoxic and 
      cytotoxic effects in mouse bone marrow cells.

TI  - Role of FNA cytology in the management of carcinoma breast.
PG  - 207-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility and role of fine needle aspiration cytology 
      (FNAC) in essential surgical management of carcinoma breast. DESIGN: Descriptive 
      study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: PNS Shifa, Karachi, Combined Military 
      Hospital (CMH), Pannu Aqil and PNS Rahat from August 1998 to August 2003 [05 
      years]. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included one hundred cases of carcinoma 
      of breast-97 females and 3 males, confirmed on histopathological examination and 
      surgically treated at PNS Shifa, CMH Pano Aqil and PNS Rahat. FNA cytology was 
      the primary tool of investigation in all. The benefit of the procedure was 
      evaluated considering the ease of the procedure, cost, safety, reliability as 
      screening procedure and its effect on sparing the patients from excision or 
      incision biopsy and thus additional anesthesia. RESULTS: Sensitivity of the 
      procedure was 78%, specificity 100%, predictve value 100% and overall diagnostic 
      accuracy 72%. Out of 78 cases, diagnosed as positive for malignancy on FNAC and 
      later confirmed by histopathological examination, 58 underwent frozen section 
      examination followed by definitive surgery (modified radical mastectomy). 
      Remaining 20 cases underwent additional core biopsy. Out of these, 12 cases 
      underwent definitive surgery without frozen section and 8 patients underwent 
      frozen section examination followed by definitive surgery. A single case required 
      general anesthesia (GA) while the patients undergoing core biopsy required a 
      local anesthesia (LA) as well. Cases remaining undiagnosed by FNA-cytology (22 
      cases) required either an excision biopsy (17 cases) or incision biopsy (5 cases) 
      under GA followed by definitive surgery, thus requiring general anesthesia twice 
      during the management. CONCLUSION: FNA-cytology can positively affect the 
      surgical management of carcinoma breast. It can be utilized to select the 
      patients for frozen section examination and can thus spare the patients from 
      additional procedure of excision or incision biopsy under separate anesthesia. It 
      may be adopted as a routine procedure in surgical outpatient.

TI  - Antigenotoxic effects of ascorbic acid against megestrol acetate-induced 
      genotoxicity in mice.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - The genotoxicity of megestrol acetate was studied in mouse bone marrow cells 
      using sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) as 
      parameters. Megestrol acetate (8.12, 16.25 and 32.50 mg/ kg of body weight) was 
      injected intraperitoneally separately in different groups of animals. Both CAs 
      and SCEs were statistically increased at 16.25 and 32.50 mg/kg of body weight. 
      Our earlier in vitro studies show the generation of free oxygen radicals, by 
      synthetic progestins responsible for the genotoxic damage. As the genotoxic 
      effects of steroids can be reduced by natural products having antioxidant 
      properties, and ascorbic acid possesses antioxidant activity, ascorbic acid (20, 
      40 or 60 mg/kg of body weight) administered together with megestrol acetate 
      (32.50 mg/kg of body weight) significantly decreased CAs and SCEs, suggesting an 
      antigenotoxic role of ascorbic acid against megestrol acetate-induced genotoxic 
      damage in mice bone marrow cells. The antigenotoxic effect was clearly dose 
      dependent. The highest protective effect was observed at 60 mg/kg body weight of 
      ascorbic acid treated with 32.50 mg/kg body weight of megestrol acetate.

TI  - Proposal for genetic characterisation of wild-type mumps strains: preliminary 
      standardisation of the nomenclature.
PG  - 1903-9
AB  - Though mumps virus (MuV) is a monotypic virus, genetic variation between strains 
      has been described. Viruses have been placed into genotypes designated A-L based 
      on the nucleotide sequence of the small hydrophobic (SH) gene, which is the most 
      variable gene in the mumps genome. Molecular characterisation of MuV is an 
      important component of mumps surveillance because it can help identify the 
      transmission pathways of the virus as well as distinguish between wild-type and 
      vaccine strains. Here, we propose a standardized nomenclature and an analysis 
      protocol for the genetic characterisation of mumps strains to facilitate 
      expansion of molecular epidemiological studies. In addition to assigning standard 
      reference strains for the recognized genotypes of MuV, a convention is proposed 
      for naming for strains and criteria to designate a new genotype.

TI  - Protective effect of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) against norgestrel induced 
      genotoxic damage.
PG  - 227-33
AB  - Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) is a phenolic lignan and possesses antioxidant 
      and number of properties potentially useful to man. The effect of NDGA was 
      studied against norgestrel induced genotoxic damage, using sister chromatid 
      exchanges (SCEs), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), mitotic index (MI) and 
      replication index (RI) as parameters. Amounts of 5, 10 and 20 microM of 
      norgestrel was tested for its genotoxic effect in the absence as well as presence 
      of S9 mix, and was found to be genotoxic at 10 and 20 microM in the presence of 
      S9 mix. Again, 10 microM of norgestrel was treated with 0.5 and 1 microM of NDGA, 
      separately, in the presence of S9 mix. Similar treatment was given with 20 microM 
      of norgestrel. Treatments given with NDGA result in the reduction of SCE, CA and 
      increase of MI as well as RI, suggesting its protective action on human 
      lymphocytes in vitro against the norgestrel induced genotoxic damage.

TI  - Protective role of allicin and L-ascorbic acid against the genotoxic damage 
      induced by chlormadinone acetate in cultured human lymphocytes.
PG  - 769-72
AB  - In our present study, different doses of allicin and L-ascorbic acid were tested 
      against the genotoxic damage induced by chlormadinone acetate (CMA; 40 microM) 
      using chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) as the 
      parameters. Treatment with allicin and L-ascorbic acid resulted in reduction of 
      CAs and SCEs. The results suggested a protective role of allicin and L-ascorbic 
      acid against CMA induced genotoxic damage.

TI  - Evaluation of genotoxic potential of norethynodrel in human lymphocytes in vitro.
PG  - 387-92
AB  - The genotoxicity study of a synthetic progestin norethynodrel, was carried out on 
      human lymphocytes chromosomes using sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), 
      replication index (RI) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) as parameters. The study 
      was carried out in the presence and absence of metabolic activation (S9 mix). 
      Norethynodrel was studied at three different concentrations (20, 40 and 60 
      microg/ml of peripheral blood lymphocyte culture) and was found non-genotoxic in 
      the absence of metabolic activation. But in the presence of S9 mix norethynodrel 
      increased SCE (p<0.03) and CA (p<0.005) frequencies and inhibits lymphocyte 
      proliferation (p<0.03) at 60 microg/ml. The results suggest a genotoxic and 
      cytotoxic effect of norethynodrel in human lymphocytes in vitro in the presence 
      of S9 mix.

TI  - Antigenotoxic effect of allicin against methyl methanesulphonate induced 
      genotoxic damage.
PG  - 547-50
AB  - Allicin, one of the sulfur compounds especially thiosulphonates of garlic (Allium 
      sativum), possesses antioxidant and thioldisulphide exchange activity and is also 
      shown to cause a variety of actions potentially useful for human health. In this 
      investigation we determined its antigenotoxic potential using chromosomal 
      aberrations (CAs) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) induced by methyl 
      methanesulphonate (MMS) as genotoxic end points both in the presence as well as 
      absence of rat liver microsomal activation system (S9 mix) in cultured human 
      lymphocytes. We tested the effect of 5, 10 and 20 microM of allicin on the damage 
      exerted by 60 microM of MMS. The levels of CAs and SCEs were lowered suggesting 
      an antigenotoxic role of allicin against genotoxic damage both in the presence as 
      well as absence of metabolic activation.

TI  - Gene diversity in some Muslim populations of North India.
PG  - 343-53
AB  - North Indian Muslim populations have historical, linguistic, and socioreligious 
      significance to the Indian subcontinent. Although sociocultural and political 
      dimensions of their demography are well documented, no detailed genetic structure 
      of the populations is available. We have undertaken a survey of the gene 
      frequencies of the ABO, Rh, PTC taste ability, sickling, and G6PD systems for 
      different endogamous groups: Sheikh, Syed, Pathan, Ansari, Saifi, and Hindu 
      Bania. All the groups at most loci showed statistically nonsignificant 
      differences, except for ABO and PTC traits, for which interpopulational 
      differences were seen. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.048 to 0.617 among the 
      Sheikh, 0.149 to 0.599 among the Pathan, 0.105 to 0.585 among the Ansari, 0.25 to 
      0.869 among the Syed, 0.107 to 0.565 among the Saifi, and 0.100 to 0.492 among 
      the Hindu Bania. The average D(ST) and G(ST) values for the five marker loci were 
      0.0625 +/- 0.098 and 0.1072 +/- 0.041, respectively. A dendrogram was constructed 
      using the UPGMA clustering method. Our results revealed that the Pathan and the 
      Sheikh form one cluster, the Syed and the Hindu Bania form another cluster, and 
      the two clusters join together (the so-called higher caste); also, the Saifi and 
      the Ansari form a separate cluster (lower caste). The results of the genetic 
      distance analysis are useful for understanding the pattern of genetic 
      relationships between different endogamous groups of Muslims.

TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of cephradine metal complexes: part I 
      complexes with magnesium, calcium, chromium and manganese.
PG  - 59-72
AB  - Cephradine is included among the first generation cephalosporins, which is active 
      against a wide range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including 
      penicillinase-producing Staphylococci. Since the presence of complexing ligand 
      may affect the bioavailability of a metal in the blood or tissues, therefore, in 
      order to study the probable interaction of cephradine with essential and trace 
      elements present in human body, cephradine has been reacted with cobalt, copper, 
      zinc and cadmium metal halides in L:M ratio of 2:1 in methanol and the products 
      recrystallized from suitable solvents to pure crystals of consistent melting 
      points. Infrared and ultraviolet studies of these complexes were carried out and 
      compared with ligand. Magnetic susceptibility studies of these complexes were 
      also carried out showing their paramagnetic behavior. From the infra red studies 
      and elemental analysis of the complexes it has been shown that the drug molecule 
      serves as a bidentate ligand coordinating through both its carboxylate at C-3 and 
      beta -lactam nitrogen and the metal having a square planar or octahedral 
      geometry. To evaluate the changes in microbiological activity of cephradine after 
      complexation, antibacterial studies were carried out by observing the changes in 
      MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of the complexes and compared with the 
      parent drug by measuring the zone of inhibition of complexes against both 
      Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. For MIC observation, serial dilution 
      method was employed and zone series were determined by disk diffusion method. Our 
      investigations reveal that formation of complexes results in decrease in 
      antibacterial activity of cephradine and MIC values are increased.

TI  - Breast feeding patterns in a military hospital.
PG  - 128-31
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the status of breast feeding, exclusive breast feeding 
      and other feeding patterns in infants upto 12 months age. DESIGN: Cross- 
      sectional study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Paediatrics Department and 
      Immunization Center, Combined Military Hospital, Multan, from October 2004 to 
      March 2005. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: This study was based on "current status 
      analysis method" to eliminate the bias of recall method used in most previous 
      studies. Mothers of 650 infants from 0-12 months of age, attending immunization 
      centre and paediatrics OPD, were interviewed about current feeding patterns and 
      other socioeconomic variables. They were divided in three groups depending upon 
      their monthly income. Living conditions matched with monthly income status in all 
      groups. Month-wise distribution of feeding pattern was determined. Analysis was 
      made about the effect of education of mothers, family income, place and mode of 
      delivery, gender of the baby on exclusive breast feeding, duration of breast 
      feeding and initiation of breast feeding. Statistical analysis of the results was 
      made by application of Parson's Chi-square test. RESULTS: Breast feeding was 
      maintained at high level (more than 88%) throughout infancy. Exclusive breast 
      feeding was also maintained at quite high level (66%) till 4 month age. But later 
      there was a sharp decline to 16% at six months of age. The median duration of 
      exclusive breast feeding was 3 months. Mothers with lesser education and lower 
      family income were more likely to exclusively breast feed (p < 0.001). The time 
      interval between birth and first feed observed was quite desirable (less than 3 
      hours) in most cases. Only 14% infants received pre-lacteal feeds (ghutti, honey, 
      water etc.), while majority of them (59%) received breast milk. Formula milk was 
      first feed in only 25% cases. Breast milk as first and early feed was observed 
      more in babies born by normal delivery in hospital (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Status of breast feeding, exclusive breast feeding and other feeding practices 
      was quite encouraging and desirable in this study. The factors responsible for 
      these results are comprehensive, free and readily available medical facilities 
      including motivational and preventive services provided to women and children in 
      military hospitals. However, there is still need to improve the figures to 
      achieve internationally set goals.

TI  - CoQ9 potentiates green tea antioxidant activities in Wistar rats.
PG  - 255-9
AB  - Green tea (Camellia sinensis), and CoQ(9 )when given to Wistar rats produced a 
      partial reversal on reserpine induced oxidative stress and liver damage. Green 
      tea, with its abundant polyphenol (-)Epigallocatechin 3-gallate (ECGC) and other 
      catechins, is known for its antioxidative characteristics influencing lipid 
      metabolism. Ubiquinone, abundant in heart muscle, is also a potent antioxidant 
      with known effects in numerous pathologies. However the combined effect of ECGC 
      and ubiquninone has not been reported. In the present study we found that green 
      tea extract, when given in combination with CoQ(9) to Wistar rats subjected to 
      oxidative stress, showed a statistically significant antioxidative effect. Liver 
      cholesterol level in rats receiving combination treatment was also significantly 
      lower than control or rats receiving green tea extract alone. Reserpine induced 
      liver damage in Wistar rats was also partially reversed by a treatment of green 
      tea extract when combined with CoQ(9). These results may have important clinical 
      implications and may be extrapolated for the treatment of patients suffering from 
      liver damage due to hepatitis B/C or liver cirrhosis.

TI  - A review of nearly two decades in an autologous blood programme: The rise and 
      fall of activity.
PG  - 307-11
AB  - Autologous blood donation (ABD) has been widely recommended. Data from one of the 
      oldest hospital-based programmes in Canada describe both activities and 
      drawbacks. Data were compared over the nearly two decades of activity that peaked 
      in 1996. A 5-year review of recent activity showed that of the 2410 patients 
      referred for consideration, 1823 (75.64%) were accepted into the programme. 
      Surgical services requested 5825 units of autologous blood. Of these, 3147 units 
      were donated by 1536 patients, 803 units were transfused in the operating room 
      and 558 units were given postoperatively. In total, only 1361 units (43.25%) were 
      transfused. The mean age of the patients was 58 years (median 61 years and mode 
      69 years). The haemoglobin concentrations before donation were significantly 
      higher, averaging 145.2 g L(-1) before donation and 114.9 g L(-1) immediately 
      before surgery, whereas at the time of discharge, the haemoglobin concentration 
      averaged 126.2 g L(-1) (P = 0.0001) in transfused patients. Data from this 
      well-established ABD programme indicate less than 50% overall utilization. The 
      activity in the programme increased until 1996 following which it dropped 
      progressively. The low haemoglobin concentration after surgery is of concern and 
      should foster a transfusion algorithm for these patients.

TI  - Selective processing of gastrointestinal symptom-related stimuli in irritable 
      bowel syndrome.
PG  - 758-61
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) was 
      associated with attentional bias toward symptom-related cues in IBS patients 
      versus healthy controls, using a modified Stroop task to measure selective 
      processing of gastrointestinal symptom-related cues. METHODS: Fifteen patients 
      with a clinical diagnosis of IBS and 15 healthy controls were recruited into the 
      study. All participants attended a single testing session, during which they 
      completed a modified Stroop task using gastrointestinal symptom-related and 
      neutral control words. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of 
      word type (p = .013), with slower color-naming times for IBS-related compared 
      with neutral words, and a significant main effect of exposure (p = .001), with 
      slower color-naming times in the unmasked condition compared with the masked 
      condition. The group x word type x exposure interaction was significant (p = 
      .048). A series of post hoc tests indicated that among patients there was 
      significant interference of symptom-related words in the masked condition but not 
      in the unmasked condition, whereas among controls, the reverse was true. 
      CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that IBS patients selectively process 
      gastrointestinal symptom-related words compared with neutral words when they are 
      presented subliminally but not when they are presented supraliminally. In 
      contrast, healthy controls demonstrate the opposite pattern. Implications for the 
      cognitive mechanisms in IBS, and future research directions, are discussed.

TI  - Genotoxic potential of medroxyprogesterone acetate in cultured human peripheral 
      blood lymphocytes.
PG  - 212-8
AB  - Medroxyprogesterone acetate was studied at three different concentrations (1, 5 
      and 10 microM), for its genotoxic effects in human peripheral blood lymphocyte 
      culture using chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges as 
      parameters. Duplicate peripheral blood cultures were treated with three different 
      concentrations (1, 5 and 10 microM) of medroxyprogesterone acetate. The study was 
      carried out both in the absence as well as in the presence of metabolic 
      activation (S9 mix) with and without NADP. Medroxyprogesterone acetate was found 
      genotoxic at 5 and 10 microM in the presence of S9 mix with NADP. To study the 
      possible mechanism of the genotoxicity of medroxyprogesterone acetate, superoxide 
      dismutase and catalase at different doses were used separately and in combination 
      with 10 microM of medroxyprogesterone at different doses in the presence of S9 
      mix with NADP. Superoxide dismutase treatment results in an increase of the 
      genotoxic damage but catalase treatment reduce the genotoxic damage of 
      medroxyprogesterone acetate. Catalase treatment in combination with superoxide 
      dismutase also results in the further reduction of the genotoxic damage. The 
      results of the present study reveal that medroxyprogesterone acetate is genotoxic 
      only in the presence of metabolic activation (S9 mix) with NADP. Treatments with 
      superoxide dismutase and catalase suggests the possible generation of reactive 
      oxygen species by redox cycling of various forms of quinones, similar to 
      estrogens, that are the results of aromatic hydroxylation by cytochrome P450s.

TI  - Hydrocarbon uptake by roots of Vicia faba (Fabaceae).
PG  - 439-43
AB  - Vicia faba was grown in crude oil polluted soil and its roots were extracted for 
      the detection and estimation of hydrocarbons. Saturated and unsaturated Aliphatic 
      Hydrocarbons (AHs) ranging from C(22) to C(36) were identified in AHs fraction. 
      However, PAHs were not present in the same extract. This could be due to the fact 
      that PAHs being toxic compounds are not accumulated in the plant root extracts of 
      V. faba grown in crude oil polluted soil. Three phytoalexins were identified and 
      estimated by mass spectrometric analysis in the root extracts of V. faba. These 
      three compounds are 2-t-butyl-4-(dimethyl benzyl) phenol, 2, 4-bis (dimethyl 
      benzyl) phenol and 2,4-bis (dimethyl benzyl)-6-butyl phenol. These phenolics in 
      V. faba are being reported for the first time. These compounds are presumably 
      elicited as a direct stress on crude oil hydrocarbons on the roots of this plant.

TI  - Identification of Some Prostanoids in Aloe vera Extracts.
PG  - 38-40
AB  - Screening of extracts from ALOE VERA revealed the presence of endogenous 
      arachidonic acid, a potential precursor for the prostanoids synthesis. The 
      presence of endogenous cyclooxygenase, in the plant extracts, was established by 
      radiometric assay. Relatively high proportions of PGE (2) and TXB (2) and low 
      proportions of other prostaglandins were identified in the plant extract when 
      incubated with [ (14)C]-arachidonic acid. Other lipids present in this plant were 
      examined and a high percentage of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol was 
      established. Possible importance of prostaglandins formed endogenously by the 
      plant is discussed.

TI  - Documenting a transfusion: how well is it done?
PG  - 568-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current practice in transfusion medicine promotes clear documentation 
      of transfusion-related events including the fact that the patient has been 
      informed of the related risks and benefits. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A 
      retrospective review of 1005 patient charts was carried out to determine 
      documentation. RESULTS: Most patients were from general surgery (10.8%) and 
      cardiac surgery (14.1%). In 75 percent of cases the physician had not documented 
      that any discussion had occurred regarding the risks and/or benefits or 
      alternatives. Only 12 percent of charts included information that the patient was 
      subsequently told what blood components were given to them. The discharge summary 
      recorded transfusion information in 32.1 percent of cases whereas the consult 
      note had this information in 26.3 percent. Chart records matched the transfusion 
      medicine records in 60.6 percent of cases. The most common error was in the blood 
      unit identification number. CONCLUSIONS: While accepted in theory, the practice 
      of documenting patient information on transfusion is not well done.

TI  - Characteristics of phenol biodegradation in saline solutions by monocultures of 
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pseudomallei.
PG  - 60-6
AB  - Phenol is a highly toxic and carcinogenic compound and its biodegradation is very 
      important to meet the environmental regulations. Two bacterial strains capable of 
      utilizing phenol as a sole source of carbon were isolated from the wastewater of 
      a pharmaceutical industry. On the basis of morphological and biochemical 
      characteristics these strains were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 
      Pseudomonas pseudomallei. Both of these strains were very efficient for phenol 
      degradation. P. pseudomallei degraded phenol at a maximum concentration of 1500 
      mg L(-1) within seven days with a specific growth rate of 0.013 h(-1) and phenol 
      degradation rate of 13.85 mg L(-1)h(-1). Maximum initial concentration of phenol 
      utilized by P. aeruginosa was 2600 mg L(-1) with 0.016 h(-1) specific growth rate 
      and 26.16 mg L(-1)h(-1) phenol degradation rate. Moreover, the effect of various 
      salts i.e., NaCl, KCl, Na(2)SO(4) and K(2)SO(4) on the growth of these strains 
      and phenol degradation rate (at 1000 mg L(-1)) was studied. In the presence of 
      these salts, P. aeruginosa showed up to 1.53 and 1.34 times faster phenol 
      degradation rate and specific growth rate, respectively as compared to P. 
      pseudomallei. In addition, P. aeruginosa exhibited higher chemical oxygen demand 
      (COD) and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) reduction rates as compared to the 
      strain P. pseudomallei.

TI  - Cephradine antacids interaction studies.
PG  - 179-84
AB  - The present work comprises of interaction studies of cephradine with antacids. 
      Cephradine is included among the first generation cephalosporin, which is active 
      against a wide range of Gram positive and Gram-negative bacteria including 
      penicillinase-producing staphylococci. Since the presence of complexing ligand 
      may affect the bioavailability of a drug in blood or tissues, therefore, in order 
      to study the probable interaction of cephradine with antacids all the reaction 
      conditions were simulated to natural environments. Antacids are commonly used in 
      patients complaining of GI irritations. The behavior of cephradine in presence of 
      seven antacids i.e., simethicone, magaldrate, magnesium carbonate, magnesium 
      hydroxide, magnesium trisilicate, sodium bicarbonate and aluminium hydroxide was 
      studied by using standard dissolution apparatus. Cephradine was monitored both by 
      UV and by high performance liquid chromatography. The results revealed that 
      antacids containing polyvalent cations retarded the in vitro availability of 
      cephradine. Moreover, these studies indicated that cephradine was strongly 
      adsorbed on antacids; magnesium trisilicate and simeco tablets (powdered) 
      exhibited relatively higher adsorption capacities.

TI  - Pattern of primary gastrointestinal tract malignancy among Saudi nationals: A 
      retrospective study.
PG  - 15-8
AB  - This histopathological reports from the central laboratory of Riyadh Central 
      Hospital for between 1404 to 1406H (1984 to 1986) were reviewed retrospectively 
      to determine the pattern of primary cancer of the gastrointestinal tract among 
      Saudi nationals. During the study period, a total of 32,990 histopathological 
      examinations were conducted. Neoplasms were identified in 4683 cases (14.2%); 
      1772 (37.8%) were malignant and 2911 (62.2%) were benign. The stomach (31%), 
      liver (20%), and esophagus (19%) were the most commonly involved organs. The 
      proportional frequencies of gastrointestinal malignancies differ from those seen 
      in Western countries, although the age and sex distribution are similar. The 
      possible etiological factors are discussed and the need for a cancer registry 
      emphasized.

TI  - Hepatocellular carcinoma: A clinicopathological analysis of 118 cases from Riyadh 
      Central Hospital.
PG  - 8-12
AB  - A review of 118 cases of histologically diagnosed hepatocellular carcinoma in 
      Riyadh Central Hospital over a 15-year period from 1985 to 1989, showed that 
      there were 73 Saudi nationals and 45 other nationalities. The overall sex ratio 
      was 2.5;1, M:F (1.92:1 in Saudis; and 4:1 in other nationalities). The mean age 
      for male Saudis was 61.2 years (range, 34-85) and for females 60.9 years (range, 
      18-80). Peak incidence occurred at 50 years for males and 60 years for females. 
      Hemoperitoneum from ruptured tumor (7 cases) and 1 case of recurrent hypoglycemia 
      were noted in the series. Tumor grading was Grade I, 10 (11.5%); Grade II, 49 
      (56.3%); Grade III, 28 (32.2%). Cirrhosis was associated with tumor in 58.0% of 
      cases. Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 47.5% of Saudis and 47% in the 
      whole group. Schistosomal serology was available in 21 cases and positive in 
      85.7%. The importance of hepatitis B virus in etiopathogenesis of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma is reflected in this study.

TI  - Kinetics of p-nitrophenol degradation by Pseudomonas pseudomallei wild and mutant 
      strains.
PG  - 1147-54
AB  - Pseudomonas pseudomallei EBN-10 strain, previously isolated from a local 
      pharmaceutical industry's wastewater, was spontaneously adapted to higher 
      p-nitrophenol (PNP) levels, which then was subjected to gamma ray-induced 
      mutagenesis; the efficient isolates hence obtained were designated as EBN-11 and 
      EBN-12, respectively. EBN-12 mutant strain could completely mineralize PNP (100 
      mg/L) on the minimal media in 24 h while, the parent strain utilized only 6% of 
      it. Addition of glucose as co-substrate further increased the PNP degradation 
      rate; however, phenol inclusion inhibited the degradation process. Ammonium 
      sulphate was experienced as the best of the nitrogen sources used by EBN-12 
      mutant strain, while degrading PNP.

TI  - Antigenotoxic role of Centella asiatica L. extract against cyproterone acetate 
      induced genotoxic damage in cultured human lymphocytes.
PG  - 10-7
AB  - The majority of the Indian population use traditional natural preparations 
      derived from plant material for the treatment of various diseases, and for that 
      reason it becomes necessary to assess the mutagenic potential or modulating 
      action of plants extract when associated with other substances. The genotoxicity 
      testing provides human a risk assessment. Earlier in vitro and in vivo studies 
      reveal that the plant extracts from various parts of the plant play a modulating 
      role in xenobiotic effects. Identification and characterization of some active 
      principles may lead to the development of the strategies to reduce the risk for 
      developing cancer in humans. Cyproterone acetate (CPA), a synthetic progestin is 
      not only a genotoxic agent but also a tumor initiating agent. It is used in oral 
      contraceptives formulations and also in the treatment of various sexual and 
      metabolic disorders. In this context, the antigenotoxic effect of Centella 
      asiatica L. extract was studied against the genotoxic effect induced by CPA on 
      human lymphocytes using chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges as 
      parameters. The treatment of the two doses of CPA, i.e. 20 and 30 microM was 
      given along with the C. asiatica extract at the dosages of 1.075 x 10(-4), 2.125 
      x 10(-4), 3.15 x 10(-4) and 4.17 x 0(-4)g/ml of culture medium. A clear dose 
      dependent decrease in the genotoxic damage of CPA was observed, suggesting a 
      protective role of C. asiatica extract during CPA therapy. The results of the 
      present study suggest that the plant extract per se do not have genotoxic 
      potential, but can modulate the genotoxicity of CPA on human lymphocytes in 
      vitro.

TI  - Abortion index and mortality of offspring among women of different age, caste and 
      population groups of north Indian Muslims.
PG  - 431-43
AB  - The Muslims of Aligarh city are predominantly Sunnis, although there are also a 
      considerable number of Shias. Among the Sunnis, approximately a quarter belong to 
      Syed, Sheikh, Moghal and Pathan groups, and three-quarters belong to various 
      lower biradaris. In the present study, 304 women attending the Primary Health 
      Centre of the J. N. Medical College and Hospital, Aligarh Muslim University, 
      Uttar Pradesh, were surveyed and the following recorded among Muslim women of 
      high-rank (Ashraf) and low-rank (Ajlaf) castes: incidence of marriage, age of the 
      mother at the time of marriage, present age of the mother, abortions, still 
      births, pre-reproductive mortality and overall mortality. The Ashraf are 
      comprised of the Sheikh, Syed and Pathan, whereas the Ajlafs have Qureshi, Saifi 
      and Ansari biradaris. Maternal age was scored as above and below 45 years in each 
      biradari. Significant effects of maternal age were seen on mortality of 
      offspring, whereas populations did not show consistent differences, except when 
      Ashrafs and Ajlafs were considered separately. The results show higher mortality 
      and abortions for various groups. This may be due to various biological and 
      socio-cultural factors, including hidden inbreeding in the remote past.

PG  - 279-82
AB  - Antioxidants and plant products are reported to reduce the genotoxic damage of 
      steroids. In our present study we have tested different dosages of 
      nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) against the genotoxic damage induced by 
      ethynodiol diacetate in the presence of S9 mix. Treatments with 
      nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) results in the reduction of the genotoxic 
      damage. A significant decrease was observed at all the tested doses of NDGA in 
      sister chromatic exchanges of number of abnormal cells. The results suggest a 
      protective role of NDGA against the genotoxic damage.

TI  - Genetic characterisation of the recent foot-and-mouth disease virus subtype 
      A/IRN/2005.
PG  - 122
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the World Reference Laboratory for FMD, a new subtype of 
      FMDV serotype A was detected in Iran in 2005. This subtype was designated 
      A/IRN/2005, and rapidly spread throughout Iran and moved westwards into Saudi 
      Arabia and Turkey where it was initially detected from August 2005 and 
      subsequently caused major disease problems in the spring of 2006. The same 
      subtype reached Jordan in 2007. As part of an ongoing project we have also 
      detected this subtype in Pakistan with the first positive samples detected in 
      April 2006. To characterise this subtype in detail, we have sequenced and 
      analysed the complete coding sequence of three subtype A/IRN/2005 isolates 
      collected in Pakistan in 2006, the complete coding sequence of one subtype 
      A/IRN/2005 isolate collected during the first outbreak in Turkey in 2005 and, in 
      addition, the partial 1D coding sequence derived from 4 epithelium samples and 34 
      swab-samples from Asian buffaloes or cattle subsequently found to be infected 
      with the A/IRN/2005 subtype. RESULTS: The phylogenies of the genome regions 
      encoding for the structural proteins, displayed, with the exception of 1A, 
      distinct, serotype-specific clustering and an evolutionary relationship of the 
      A/IRN/2005 sublineage with the A22 sublineage. Potential recombination events 
      have been detected in parts of the genome region coding for the non-structural 
      proteins of FMDV. In addition, amino acid substitutions have been detected in the 
      deduced VP1 protein sequence, potentially related to clinical or subclinical 
      outcome of FMD. Indications of differential susceptibility for developing a 
      subclinical course of disease between Asian buffaloes and cattle have been 
      detected.Furthermore, hitherto unknown insertions of 2 amino acids before the 
      second start codon, as well as sublineage specific amino acids have been detected 
      in the genome region encoding for the leader proteinase of A/IRN/2005 sublineage. 
      CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that the A/IRN/2005 sublineage has undergone 
      two different paths of evolution for the structural and non-structural genome 
      regions. The structural genome regions have had their evolutionary starting point 
      in the A22 sublineage. It can be assumed that, due to the quasispecies structure 
      of FMDV populations and the error-prone replication process, advantageous 
      mutations in a changed environment have been fixed and lead to the occurrence of 
      the new A/IRN/2005 sublineage. Together with this mechanism, recombination within 
      the non-structural genome regions, potentially modifying the virulence of the 
      virus, may be involved in the success of this new sublineage. The possible origin 
      of this recombinant virus may be a co-infection with Asia1 and a serotype A 
      precursor of the A/IRN/2005 sublineage potentially within Asian Buffaloes, as 
      these appears to relatively easy become infected, but usually without developing 
      clinical disease and consequently showing not a strong acute inflammatory immune 
      response against a second FMDV infection.

TI  - Gender sensitization among health providers and communities through 
      transformative learning tools: experiences from Karachi, Pakistan.
PG  - 118
AB  - CONTEXT: Pakistan lags far behind most developing countries in women's health and 
      gender equity. Appropriateness of health care services vis-a-vis the gender 
      specific cultural norms that influence clients' needs are not very visible and 
      are more difficult to monitor. Programs and services need to be sensitively 
      designed to facilitate women's access to physical and social needs. This paper 
      narrates the experience of working with health providers from public and private 
      sectors, community, local government representatives and community-based 
      organizations. Through transformative learning, this endeavour focused on 
      initiating a process of sensitization on gender related health issues for women. 
      APPROACH: The initiative was primarily based on the use of the following two 
      standardized tools: 'Health Workers for Change' for working with health providers 
      and 'Initiating Women Empowerment for Health' for interacting with the community. 
      Both tools focus primarily on women's health and social issues affecting their 
      health status. The research methodology used was predominantly qualitative, using 
      focus group discussions, participatory rural appraisal and interactive workshops. 
      IMPLICATIONS: This approach endeavours to sensitize the health service providers 
      to the health needs of female clients and encourages behavioural changes. 
      Simultaneously, it creates an opportunity to raise awareness among women and the 
      community in general regarding appropriate health-seeking behaviour and the 
      timely use of health services. The information collected is evidence for policy 
      makers regarding the gender-based problems faced by women who are seeking health 
      care and it suggests how to overcome these problems.

TI  - Antigenotoxic effect of apigenin against anti-cancerous drugs.
PG  - 625-31
LID - 10.1016/j.tiv.2007.12.002 [doi]
AB  - Mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide are well known anti-tumor drugs. Their genotoxic 
      effects are well established in various test systems. The genotoxic effects in 
      non-tumor cell are of special significance due to the possibility that they may 
      induce secondary tumors in cancer patients. Apigenin is a well known anti-oxidant 
      and possess number of properties that are beneficial in some way to humans. With 
      this view, the present study deals with the effect of apigenin against the 
      genotoxic doses of mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide using chromosomal 
      aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges and cell cycle kinetics as a parameters. 
      The treatment of apigenin results in a significant, dose dependent decrease in 
      the genotoxic damage, induced by mitomycin C and cyclophosphamide. It is 
      concluded that the apigenin is potent in reducing the genotoxic damage, induced 
      by anti-cancerous drugs, thereby reducing the chances of developing secondary 
      tumors during the therapy.

TI  - Measles vaccination and antibody response in autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 832-7
LID - 10.1136/adc.2007.122937 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that measles vaccination was involved in the 
      pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as evidenced by signs of a 
      persistent measles infection or abnormally persistent immune response shown by 
      circulating measles virus or raised antibody titres in children with ASD who had 
      been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) compared with controls. 
      DESIGN: Case-control study, community based. METHODS: A community sample of 
      vaccinated children aged 10-12 years in the UK with ASD (n = 98) and two control 
      groups of similar age, one with special educational needs but no ASD (n = 52) and 
      one typically developing group (n = 90), were tested for measles virus and 
      antibody response to measles in the serum. RESULTS: No difference was found 
      between cases and controls for measles antibody response. There was no 
      dose-response relationship between autism symptoms and antibody concentrations. 
      Measles virus nucleic acid was amplified by reverse transcriptase-PCR in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells from one patient with autism and two typically 
      developing children. There was no evidence of a differential response to measles 
      virus or the measles component of the MMR in children with ASD, with or without 
      regression, and controls who had either one or two doses of MMR. Only one child 
      from the control group had clinical symptoms of possible enterocolitis. 
      CONCLUSION: No association between measles vaccination and ASD was shown.

LID - 10.1556/ABiol.58.2007.4.7 [doi]
AB  - The anti-genotoxic effect of Ocimum sanctum L. extract was studied against the 
      genotoxic effect induced by a synthetic progestin cyproterone acetate, on human 
      lymphocytes using chromosomal aberrations, mitotic index, sister chromatid 
      exchanges and replication index as a parameters. About 30 microM of cyproterone 
      acetate was treated with O. sanctum L. infusion, at dosages of 1.075 x 10(-4), 
      2.125 x 10(-4) and 3.15 x 10(-4) g/ml of culture medium. A clear dose-dependent 
      decrease in the genotoxic damage of cyproterone acetate was observed, suggesting 
      a possible modulating role of the plant infusion. The results of the present 
      study suggest that the plant infusion per se does not have genotoxic potential, 
      but can modulate the genotoxicity of cyproterone acetate on human lymphocytes in 
      vitro.

AB  - A comparison of crude curcuminoid extract and purified curcumin was made to 
      evaluate hepato- and immunoprotective effect of Curcuma longa (turmeric) 
      Zingiberaceae. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced cellular hepatic damage was 
      evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, hepatic enzymes and thiobarbituric 
      acid reactive species (TBAR) values. A selective cytolytic effect of CCl4 was 
      observed among immature (PNA+) thymocytes and peripheral helper (CD4+) T 
      lymphocytes in spleen and was paralleled by a significant reduction in CD25, CD71 
      and Con A receptor expression. Treatment with curcuminoid crude extract at two 
      different doses, showed a significant cellular recovery among hepatocytes, which 
      was reflected in a reduction of hepatic enzymes and TBAR values. A significant 
      restoration of lymphocyte viability and CD25, CD71 and Con A receptor expression 
      in both immature (PNA+) thymocytes and splenic helper (CD4+) T lymphocytes was 
      observed. Turmeric crude extract, at both low and high dose, was found to be more 
      efficient as compared to purified curcumin.

AB  - Pilot scale reactor based on combined biological-coagulation-filtration 
      treatments was designed and evaluated for the treatment of effluent from a paper 
      and board mill. Biological treatment by fed batch reactor (FBR) followed by 
      coagulation and sand filtration (SF) resulted in a total COD and BOD reduction of 
      93% and 96.5%, respectively. A significant reduction in both COD (90%) and BOD 
      (92%) was also observed by sequencing batch reactor (SBR) process followed by 
      coagulation and filtration. Untreated effluent was found to be toxic, whereas the 
      treated effluents by either of the above two processes were found to be non-toxic 
      when exposed to the fish for 72h. The resultant effluent from 
      FBR-coagulation-sand filtration system meets National Environmental Quality 
      Standards (NEQS) of Pakistan and can be discharged into the environment without 
      any risks.

AB  - Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), a phenolic lignan, was tested for its 
      antigenotoxic potential against chlormadinone acetate (CMA)-induced genotoxic 
      damage in mice bone-marrow cells. Doses of about 22.50 mg/kg body weight of CMA 
      were given along with 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg body weight of NDGA intraperitoneally. 
      The treatment resulted in the reduction of sister chromatid exchanges and 
      chromosomal aberrations induced by CMA, suggesting an antigenotoxic potential of 
      NDGA. Earlier studies show that CMA generates reactive oxygen species, 
      responsible for genotoxic damage. The free radical-scavenging property of NDGA is 
      responsible for the reduction of genotoxic damage induced by CMA in mice 
      bone-marrow cells.

TI  - Epidemiology of foot-and-mouth disease in Landhi Dairy Colony, Pakistan, the 
      world largest Buffalo colony.
PG  - 53
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-5-53 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Pakistan and causes huge 
      economic losses. This work focus on the Landhi Dairy Colony (LDC), located in the 
      suburbs of Karachi. LDC is the largest Buffalo colony in the world, with more 
      than 300,000 animals (around 95% buffaloes and 5% cattle, as well as an unknown 
      number of sheep and goats). Each month from April 2006 to April 2007 we collected 
      mouth-swabs from apparently healthy buffaloes and cattle, applying a convenient 
      sampling based on a two-stage random sampling scheme, in conjunction with 
      participatory information from each selected farm. Furthermore, we also collected 
      epithelium samples from animals with clinical disease, as well as mouth-swabs 
      samples from those farms. In addition, we analysed a total of 180 serum samples 
      randomly collecting 30 samples each month at the local slaughterhouse, from 
      October 2006 to March 2007. Samples have been screened for FMDV by real-time 
      RT-PCR and the partial or full 1D coding region of selected isolates has been 
      sequenced. Serum samples have been analysed by applying serotype-specific 
      antibody ELISA and non-structural proteins (NSP) antibody ELISA. RESULTS: FMDV 
      infection prevalence at aggregate level shows an endemic occurrence of FMDV in 
      the colony, with peaks in August 2006, December 2006 and February 2007 to March 
      2007. A significant association of prevalence peaks to the rainy seasons, which 
      includes the coldest time of the year and the muslimic Eid-festival, has been 
      demonstrated. Participatory information indicated that 88% of all questioned 
      farmers vaccinate their animals. Analysis of the serum samples showed high levels 
      of antibodies for serotypes O, A, Asia 1 and C. The median endpoint-titre for all 
      tested serotypes, except serotype C, in VNT titration is at a serum dilution of 
      equal or above 1/100. All 180 serum samples collected have been tested for 
      antibodies against the non-structural proteins and all but four have been found 
      positive. Out of the 106 swab-samples from apparently healthy and affected 
      animals positive in real-time RT-PCR, we sequenced the partial or full 1D coding 
      region from 58 samples. In addition we sequenced the full 1D coding region of 17 
      epithelium samples from animals with clinical signs of FMD. From all sequenced 
      samples, swabs and epithelium, 19 belong to the regional PanAsia II lineage of 
      serotype O and 56 to the A/Iran/2005 lineage of serotype A. CONCLUSION: For an 
      effective and realisable FMD control program in LDC, we suggest to introduce a 
      twice annually mass vaccination of all buffaloes and cattle in the colony. These 
      mass vaccinations should optimally take place shortly before the beginning of the 
      two rainy periods, e.g. in June and September. Those vaccinations should, in our 
      opinion, be in addition to the already individually performed vaccinations of 
      single animals, as the latter usually targets only newly introduced animals. This 
      suggested combination of mass vaccination of all large ruminants with the already 
      performed individually vaccination should provide a continuous high level of herd 
      immunity in the entire colony. Vaccines used for this purpose should contain the 
      matching vaccine strains, i.e. as our results indicate antigens for A/Iran/2005 
      and the regional type of serotype O (PanAsia II), but also antigens of the, in 
      this world region endemic, Asia 1 lineage should be included. In the long term it 
      will be important to control the vaccine use, so that subclinical FMD will be 
      avoided.

TI  - Ethical practices for health research in the Eastern Mediterranean region of the 
      World Health Organization: a retrospective data analysis.
PG  - e2094
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0002094 [doi]
LID - e2094
AB  - BACKGROUND: Commentators have expressed concern regarding the existence of proper 
      ethics review systems in developing countries. Our aim is to explore the extent 
      with which investigators from countries in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) Region 
      consider several ethical practices in the conduct of their research. 
      METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Investigators from 12 countries in the EM region 
      submitted 143 proposals involving Public Health and Biotechnology & Genomics to a 
      grant scheme funded by the Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office of the WHO and 
      the Organization of Islamic Conference Standing Committee for Science and 
      Technological Cooperation in 2006. The grant application included a 1-page 
      questionnaire that asked investigators 1) whether ethical clearance was obtained, 
      2) whether they plan to obtain informed consent, and 3) whether confidentiality 
      of human subject data would be ensured. The methodologies of the submitted 
      researches were categorized as to whether it involved 1) human subject research 
      (e.g., the prospective collection of biological specimens or the performance of 
      qualitative research), 2) research that could be exempt from ongoing ethics 
      review, and 3) research not involving human subjects. A descriptive analysis was 
      used to analyze the investigators' responses and a chi-square analysis was used 
      to analyze categorical variables. Of the 79 submitted proposals determined to 
      involve "human subjects", ethical clearance was not obtained in 29%; 
      investigators thought that informed consent was not needed in 29%; and 
      investigators did not mention that they would ensure confidentiality of the 
      obtained data in 8% of the studies. The magnitude of these deficiencies was 
      similar regardless of study design type, i.e., prospective collection of 
      biological samples and qualitative research methods. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: 
      These results suggest that attention to ethical safeguards is not optimal among 
      investigators in the EM Region. Further guidelines for strengthening ethical 
      review systems, as well as enhanced educational training in concepts of research 
      ethics for investigators are warranted in this region.

AB  - Bacillus strain CTP-09 yielded maximum productivity (1120 IU/L.h) of 
      extracellular endoglucanase (CMCase) on 0.5% cellobiose after 10 h fermentation 
      at 55 degrees C. The purified enzyme is mono-meric in nature and exhibits 
      stability up to 80 degrees C and over a pH range (6.0-9.0). Activation energy, 
      enthalpy and entropy of catalysis, and inactivation indicated that this CMCase is 
      highly thermos-table. Purified enzyme possessed high power of defibrillation of 
      textile and was minutely inhibited by anionic detergent and oxidizing agent 
      comparable with inhibition by commercial enzyme. This polypeptide could be 
      exploited for mass production and application in local industries.

TI  - Etiology of short stature in children.
PG  - 493-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the causes of short stature in children with special 
      emphasis on growth hormone deficiency. STUDY DESIGN: Case series. PLACE AND 
      DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Paediatrics, Military Hospital, Rawalpindi and 
      Combined Military Hospital, Multan from September 2004 to January 2007. 
      METHODOLOGY: Two hundred and fourteen children (140 boys and 74 girls), ranging 
      from 02 to 15 years presenting with short stature were studied. Height and weight 
      were plotted on appropriate growth charts and centiles determined. Relevant 
      hematological and biochemical investigations including thyroid profile were done. 
      Bone age was determined in all cases. Growth hormone axis was investigated after 
      excluding other causes. Karyotyping was done in selected cases. Data was analyzed 
      by SPSS 10.0 by descriptive statistics. Mean values were compared using t-test. 
      RESULTS: In this study, the five most common etiological factors in order of 
      frequency were Constitutional Growth Delay (CGD), Familial Short Stature (FSS), 
      malnutrition, coeliac disease and Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD). In 37.4% of 
      patients, the study revealed normal variants of growth - CGD, FSS or combination 
      of both, 46.7% cases had nonendocrinological and 15.9% had endocrinological 
      etiology. CGD (22.1%) in males and FSS (27%) in females were the most common 
      etiology. GHD was found in 6.1% children and it comprised 38.2% of all 
      endocrinological causes. Children with height falling below 0.4th centile were 
      more likely to have a pathological short stature (79.2%) compared to 39.3% whose 
      height was below 3rd centile but above 0.4th centile (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: CGD 
      and FSS are most common causes of short stature in boys and girls respectively, 
      whereas, GHD is a relatively uncommon etiology.

      has seen increased application following the AIDS epidemic. Such autologous 
      programs have been both applauded and criticized in recent years with little 
      information available regarding actual application. METHODS: One hundred and 
      fifty-five of the largest hospitals in the province of Ontario received surveys 
      assessing the demographics, logistics and funding of autologous blood programs 
      available to them. Results, a total of 78 hospitals replied, indicating that 77 
      sites had access to an autologous program with 26 sites having a program within 
      their hospital. The local blood provider, Canadian Blood Services (CBS), provided 
      access to autologous donations either alone or to the hospital in 62 sites. Three 
      hospitals operated the program entirely on their own. Fifteen hospitals had no 
      access to an autologous program at any site. Programs were funded in a variety of 
      ways including patient fees in five hospitals. DISCUSSION: In the largest 
      Canadian province the autologous blood programs are highly variable with service 
      not provided at all in some regions whereas in others there is a very active 
      program often involving Canadian blood services either as a stand-alone or 
      hospital integrated supplier. This variation in activity of the autologous 
      program is in marked contrast to those for whole blood and apheresis collections 
      where great standardization, through the CBS is the norm.

AB  - Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from Kuwaiti 
      desert, when incubated with exogenous progesterone for 10 days at 65 degrees C 
      produced two monohydroxylated, two dihydroxy isomers of progesterone and a B-Seco 
      compound. These metabolites were purified by TLC and HPLC followed by their 
      identification through (1)H, (13)C NMR and other spectroscopic data. Microbial 
      hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol resulted in the production of estrone. The 
      effect of some inducers resulted in the production of two metabolites from 
      17beta-estradiol, one of which was identified as 
      3,6beta,17beta-trihydroxyestra-1,3,5,14(10)-tetrene and the other metabolite 
      remains unidentified. The transformation products were identified through their 
      spectral data and comparison with reference compounds. Antioxidant activities of 
      progesterone transformed mixture and purified metabolites of 17beta-estradiol 
      were studied by linoleic acid/beta-carotene assay. An enhanced antioxidant 
      activity for progesterone transformation products was observed when compared to 
      progesterone. A comparison of antioxidant activity of progesterone and 
      17beta-estradiol transformation products is reported.

AB  - The antigenotoxic effect of apigenin was studied against the genotoxic damage 
      induced by mitomycin C on mouse bone marrow cells using sister chromatid 
      exchanges (SCEs) and chromosomal aberrations (CAs) as parameters. Apigenin was 
      studied at three different doses i.e. 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg b.w. and was found to 
      be non-genotoxic at all the above three doses. Mitomycin C at 2 mg/kg b.w. was 
      given along with the 10, 20 and 40 mg/kg bw of apigenin. A significant decrease 
      in SCEs and CAs was observed, suggesting a protective role of apigenin against 
      the genotoxicity of mitomycin C on mice bone marrow cells.

TI  - Green tea modulates reserpine toxicity in animal models.
PG  - 77-87
AB  - Reserpine, a natural product extracted from Rauwolfia serpintina or Rauwolfia 
      vomitoria, is a known dopamine depleter that inhibits several neurotransmitters. 
      Reserpine has been used clinically to control hypertension, schizophrenia, 
      insomnia and insanity. The use of this drug, however, has been limited because of 
      its side effects which include oxidative damage to organs, including the liver. 
      Green tea catechins are potent antioxidants that have the potential to counteract 
      reserpine induced oxidative stress. This study investigated the merits of 
      administering green tea concurrently with reserpine to prevent oxidative hepatic 
      damage in Sprague-Dawely (SD) rats. Reserpine was found to cause hepatic damage, 
      with elevated levels of oxidative stress markers, such as Thiobarbituric Acid 
      Reactive Substances (TBARS), transaminases and cholesterol. Reserpine also 
      induced hepatic ultra-structural damage in the cytoplasmic membrane, nuclear 
      envelope, endoplasmic reticulum (rER), ribosomal stripping and mitochondria. 
      Electron microscopy examination showed revival of liver cells as a result of 
      green tea extract administration to experimental rats.

TI  - The epidemiology of peste des petits ruminants in Pakistan and possible control 
      policies.
PG  - 869-76
AB  - Peste des petits ruminants made its first clinical appearance in Pakistan during 
      an epidemic in Punjab Province in 1991, but its level of activity in subsequent 
      years was never systematically recorded. In 2003, 2004 and 2005 teams trained in 
      participatory disease surveillance methods visited a large number of villages 
      throughout Pakistan to record the prevalence and impact of key livestock 
      diseases. Peste des petits ruminants has emerged from their study as a common and 
      economically damaging disease of small ruminants within the country, appearing to 
      be endemic in the north of Punjab and epidemic in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and 
      Sindh during the study period. It should be possible to reduce the incidence 
      level using a combination of zoosanitary measures and the intensive use of 
      vaccine.

TI  - Possible modulating action of plant infusion of Ocimum sanctum L. on chromosomal 
      aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges induced by chlormadinone acetate in 
      human lymphocytes in vitro.
PG  - 845-8
AB  - Chlormadinone acetate (CMA) is a synthetic progesterone analogue. It has its 
      usage in oral contraceptives formulations and also for estrous synchronization of 
      animals. The aim of the present study is to study the anti- genotoxic activity of 
      the plant infusion against the CMA induced genotoxic damage on cultured human 
      lymphocytes, using chromosomal aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges (SCFs) 
      as parameters. For chromosomal aberration analysis, the treatment of 40 microM of 
      CMA was associated with 4.33% abnormal metaphases. The treatment of 40 microM of 
      CMA, separately with 1.075 x 10(-4), 2.125 x 10(-4) and 3.15 x 10(-4) gm l(-1) of 
      plant infusion results in the reduction of the number of abnormal metaphases i.e. 
      2.67%, 2.00% and 1.67% respectively. For sister chromatid exchange analysis, the 
      frequency of sister chromatid exchange per cell (SCE(S)/Cell) for the treatment 
      of 40 microM of CMA was 6.43. The treatment of 40 microM of CMA, separately with 
      1.075 x 10(-4), 2.125 x 10(-4) and 3.15 x 10(-4) gm l(-1) of plant infusion 
      results in the significant reduction of the frequency of SCE(S)/Cell i.e. 3.76, 
      3.01 and 2.94, respectively, as compared to the CMA (40 microM) treatment alone 
      (6.43). The used dosages of plant infusion did not increase chromosomal 
      aberrations and sister chromatid exchanges at significant level as compared to 
      the untreated. The results of the present study suggest that the plant infusion 
      per se does not have genotoxic potential, but can modulate the genotoxicity of 
      chlormadinone acetate in human lymphocytes in vitro.

TI  - The impact of variation in the pulse sequence parameters on image uniformity in 
      magnetic resonance imaging.
PG  - 231-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the practical impact of alteration of key imaging 
      parameters of Magnetic Resonance Imaging on image quality and effectiveness 
      provided by widely available fast imaging pulse sequences. METHODS: A tissue 
      equivalent material for Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) has been produced from a 
      polysaccharide gel, agros, containing gadolinium chloride chelated to Ethylene 
      Diamine Tetra- Acetic acid (EDTA) with a sort of T1 and T2 values. Experimental 
      variations in key parameters included echo time (TE) and repetition time TR. 
      Quantitative analysis consisted of image nonuniformity. RESULTS: In T2 weighted 
      images; any change in TE played a critical role in the signal homogeneity in all 
      pulse sequences. The percentage of nonuniformity was incredibly high in T2 
      weighted image but the change of TR was insignificant in T2-weighted study. 
      Involving T1 weighted images, percentage of nonuniformity was high in gradient 
      recalled echo (GRE), also noticeable in fast fluid attenuated recovery (FLAIR) 
      but quite acceptable in fast spin echo (FSE) and conventional spin echo (CSE). 
      CONCLUSION: Selection of parameters relatively simple in CSE both in T1, 
      T2-weighted study that maintains image uniformity and quality as well. GRE is a 
      very sensitive pulse sequence for any variation in parameters and loose signal 
      uniformity rapidly.

TI  - Presentation and complications of snakebite in a tertiary care hospital.
PG  - 304-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine frequency of various modes of presentation, complications 
      and management of snakebite. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive case series. PLACE AND 
      DURATION OF STUDY: Medical Unit II, Rawalpindi General Hospital, Rawalpindi, 
      Pakistan, from September 2006 to August 2007. METHODOLOGY: All patients over 12 
      years of age and presenting to emergency department with history of snakebite and 
      features of envenomation were included in the study. All these patients were 
      given Anti-Snake Venom. Symptomatic treatment of complications was done. 
      Semi-structured questionnaire was filled during hospital stay to analyze various 
      characteristics of snakebite and people's attitude towards this problem. RESULTS: 
      A total of 65 patients were enrolled in the study with 40 males (61.5%) and 25 
      (38.5%) females. Maximum cases 15 (23%) were seen in the month of August. Age 
      group, that was maximally affected, was between 26-30 years (12 cases or 18.5%). 
      Only 2 patients had neurotoxic snakebite, whereas rest of the cases were vasculo 
      toxic in nature. Gum bleeding and cellulitis were the main presenting complaints. 
      Mortality was 4.6% (3 cases). A great majority of patients arrived late in the 
      hospital because of lack of awareness and use of traditional though ineffective 
      measures. CONCLUSION: Snakebite is a major public health problem. Patients with 
      snakebite can be managed effectively provided timely administration of anti-snake 
      Venom is done.

TI  - Gene diversity and biochemical markers among some Muslim populations of Uttar 
      Pradesh.
PG  - 29-36
AB  - A sample of 312 individuals belonging to Sheikh (80), Pathan (54), Ansari (82), 
      Syed (33), Saifi (33) and Hindu Bania (30) populations were surveyed for four 
      protein and three enzyme loci comprising 12 alleles. The markers used were 
      protein (transferrin, haptoglobin, haemoglobin) and enzyme (lactate 
      dehydrogenase, phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, adenylate kinase). Except 
      caeruloplasmin, variants were found among all loci, though no rare variant 
      appears. The populations show genetic equilibrium for all of the loci. Our gene 
      frequencies show some difference from earlier studies for Muslims in general, 
      there being no biradari wise study among Sunni Muslims earlier done anywhere in 
      India or abroad. Heterozygosity ranged from 0.0123 to 0.1994 (Sheikh), 0.0182 to 
      0.2046 (Pathan), 0.0239 to 0.1844 (Ansari), 0.0587 to 0.3966 (Syed), 0 to 0.3909 
      (Bania); the average DST and GST values for the seven marker loci were 0.001032 
      and 0.00879, respectively. The results are discussed. The gene frequency study 
      shows closer relationship of Ansaris and Saifis with native Hindu Banias, and may 
      reflect on their probable conversion in the not remote past.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency and severity of leucopenia during antiviral 
      treatment in patients with hepatitis C and the effectiveness of G-CSF 
      (Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor) in its management. STUDY DESIGN: An 
      observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Shafi Clinic, Rawalpindi, from 
      July 2005 to July 2007. METHODOLOGY: Patients with Polymerase Chain Reaction 
      (PCR) positive for Hepatitis C Virus-Ribonucleic Acid (HCVRNA) by Enzyme Linked 
      Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method were included in the study. Standard 
      combination therapy was given to all i.e. interferon and ribavirin. Those with 
      total leukocyte count (TLC)<4000/cmm were given injection Granulocyte-Colony 
      Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) according to severity of leucopenia. Response to 
      therapy was noted and dose titration was done accordingly. RESULTS: A total of 
      208 patients were enrolled in the study with 99 (48%) males and 109 (52%) 
      females. Total leukocyte count (TLC)<4000/cmm was observed in 78 (37.5%) cases. 
      Conventional interferon induced leucopenia was seen in 60 out of 172 (35%) cases. 
      Pegylated interferon induced leucopenia was seen in 18 out of 36 (50%) cases. 
      Patients on Pegylated interferon had more severe leucopenia as compared to those 
      on conventional interferon. Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) 
      administration resulted in an increase in mean total leukocyte count from 2300 to 
      5200/cmm. No patient required antiviral dose reduction or discontinuation. 
      CONCLUSION: Recombinant Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) 
      administration tends to manage leucopenia, which is a common adverse effect of 
      antiviral treatment for hepatitis C.

TI  - Capacity mapping of national ethics committees in the Eastern Mediterranean 
      Region.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1186/1472-6939-10-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethics issues in the areas of science, technology and medicine have 
      emerged during the last few decades. Many countries have responded by 
      establishing ethics committees at the national level. Identification of National 
      Ethics Committees (NECs) in the Eastern Mediterranean (EM) region and the extent 
      of their functions and capacity would be helpful in developing capacity building 
      programs that address the needs of these committees. Accordingly, we conducted a 
      survey to determine the characteristics of existing NECs in the EM region. 
      METHODS: We developed a questionnaire to collect information on different aspects 
      of NECs. The questionnaire was sent to the WHO country office in each of the 22 
      Member States in the EM region. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the 
      data. RESULTS: We obtained responses from 77% (17/22) of the EM countries; 88% 
      (15/17) of the countries stated they had NECs. Of these NECs, 40% (6/15) were 
      involved in the ethics of science and technology, 73% (11/15) in medical ethics, 
      and 93% (14/15) in medical research ethics; 10 NECs stated they reviewed research 
      protocols. Of the respondent NECs, 25% (4/15) met at least on a monthly basis. 
      Regarding training, 21% of the members from all of the NECs had received formal 
      training in ethics; 53% (8/15) of the NECs had none of their members with formal 
      training in ethics. Regarding support, 33% (5/15) received financial support and 
      60% (9/15) had administrative support. CONCLUSION: While many countries in the EM 
      region report the existence of NECs, many meet infrequently, many have members 
      without formal training in ethics, and many lack important financial and 
      administrative resources. Further efforts should be directed towards capacity 
      building programs that include ethics training and provision of important 
      infrastructure resources for these committees.

      fragmentation after the treatment of anticancerous drug mitomycin C and curcumin 
      in cultured human blood lymphocytes.
PG  - 503-8
LID - 10.1016/j.etp.2009.06.010 [doi]
AB  - Mitomycin C (MMC) is an antineoplastic agent used to fight a number of different 
      cancers including cancer of the stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, breast, lung, 
      uterus, cervix, bladder, head, neck, eye and oesophagus. It is a potent DNA 
      cross-linker. The prolonged use of the drug may result in permanent bone marrow 
      damage and other various types of secondary tumors in normal cells. The toxic 
      effect of anticancerous drugs may be reduced if supplemented with natural 
      antioxidants/plant products. With this view, the effect of 5, 10 and 15 microM of 
      curcumin was studied against the genotoxic doses of MMC, i.e. 10 and 20 microM, 
      in cultured human lymphocytes using cell viability, lipid peroxidation and DNA 
      damage quantification as parameters. The treatment of curcumin with MMC results 
      in a significant dose-dependent increase in cell viability and decrease in lipid 
      peroxidation and DNA damage suggesting a protective role of curcumin against the 
      anticancerous drug mitomycin C.

PG  - 38-43

AB  - The aim of this study was to use different gamma histogram criteria for the 
      comparison of planned dose with irradiated dose distribution and find that what 
      percent of pixels passing a certain criteria imitate a good quality plan. The 
      dose was calculated for 156 patients by inverse planning optimization using the 
      Corvus treatment planning system. Gafchromic films in combination with 2571 0.6 
      cm(3) Farmer type ionization chamber and Farmer 2570/1 electrometer from NE 
      Technology were used to measure the delivered dose in solid water phantom. All 
      the measurements were performed on Varian CL21EX linear accelerator (Varian 
      Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) fitted with a Millennium 120 leaf collimator. In 
      this study the mean value of the percent of passing pixels within the region of 
      interest under the criterion of 3% DD and 3mm DTA is 90.2+/-7.1% for head and 
      neck cases and 92.2+/-5.8% for non-head and neck cases. If we choose the criteria 
      of 3% DD and 3mm DTA then 96.3% head and neck plans have the percent of passing 
      pixels>or=75% and 95.1% non-head and neck plans have the percent of passing 
      pixels>or=80%. It is evident from the results of this study that the criterion of 
      5% DD and 3mm DTA with the percent of passing pixels>or=90 for non-head and neck 
      cases while the percent of passing pixels>or=85 for head and neck cases endorse 
      that a plan is good. The results of this study may be useful for other 
      institutions which use verification software and EBT films for patient specific 
      IMRT QA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the 1-year efficacy of contraception, changes in bleeding 
      pattern and weight with the use of Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate-subcutaneous 
      injected subcutaneously once every 3 months. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive 
      case-series. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Gynaecology and Obstetrics Unit, Holy 
      Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, from March 2003 to June 2004. METHODOLOGY: Twenty 
      five patients were selected by purposive sampling and followed up in Holy Family 
      Hospital, Gynaecology and Obstetric Unit for a one-year period using DMPA-SC 
      every three months. Hospital Ethical Committee permission was obtained prior to 
      commencement of the study. Informed written consent was taken. Body weight was 
      measured at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. Bleeding analysis in terms of 
      blood flow and severity of bleeding was also done at 3 months interval using a 
      5-point scale. RESULTS: DMPA-SC showed 100% efficacy in preventing pregnancy in 
      the 25 patients who were followed up. Mean and SD of age was 34.24+/-3.57 years. 
      Mean and SD of weight was 63.44+/-13.81 kg.There was a mean weight gain of 0.1 kg 
      at visit 1-3 (first 3 months) and an average weight gain of 1.036 kg at the end 
      of the year. There was a trend towards amenorrhea with 56% of the patients 
      included in the category of bleeding less than usual at the end of treatment 
      period. CONCLUSION: DMPA-SC can be used in women desiring reversible 
      contraception with unremarkable weight gain and overall bleeding pattern leading 
      towards amenorrhea.

AB  - Clinical and radiological liver diseases are uncommon in patients with systemic 
      lupus erythematosus (SLE). We report a 29-year-old female with SLE who presented 
      with right upper quadrant abdominal pain, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver 
      enzymes and multiple hypodense lesions in the liver on a computed tomography (CT) 
      study that mimicked multiple liver abscesses. A liver biopsy showed mild chronic 
      inflammation. Culture results were negative. With steroid therapy the patient 
      improved clinically, the platelet count returned to the normal range and the 
      multiple liver lesions disappeared radiologicaly. This patient represents a rare 
      case of SLE that had hepatic vasculitis mimicking multiple liver abscesses.

PG  - 15-7
AB  - Lymphoid tissue is normally absent in the gastric mucosa; however, lymphoid 
      follicles are very frequently noted in Helicobacter-associated gastritis. We 
      reviewed 237 cases of chronic gastritis with lymphoid follicles. Out of this 227 
      cases (95.8%) were found to have H. pylori infection. The significance of this 
      finding and its possible relationship to primary gastric lymphoma are discussed.

TI  - IMRT quality assurance using a second treatment planning system.
PG  - 274-9
LID - 10.1016/j.meddos.2009.09.001 [doi]
AB  - We used a second treatment planning system (TPS) for independent verification of 
      the dose calculated by our primary TPS in the context of patient-specific quality 
      assurance (QA) for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). QA plans for 24 
      patients treated with inverse planned dynamic IMRT were generated using the Nomos 
      Corvus TPS. The plans were calculated on a computed tomography scan of our QA 
      phantom that consists of three Solid Water slabs sandwiching radiochromic films, 
      and an ion chamber that is inserted into the center slab of the phantom. For the 
      independent verification, the dose was recalculated using the Varian Eclipse TPS 
      using the multileaf collimator files and beam geometry from the original plan. 
      The data was then compared in terms of absolute dose to the ion chamber volume as 
      well as relative dose on isodoses calculated at the film plane. The calculation 
      results were also compared with measurements performed for each case. When 
      comparing ion chamber doses, the mean ratio was 0.999 (SD 0.010) for Eclipse vs. 
      Corvus, 0.988 (SD 0.020) for the ionization chamber measurements vs. Corvus, and 
      0.989 (SD 0.017) for the ionization chamber measurements vs. Eclipse. For 2D 
      doses with gamma histogram, the mean value of the percentage of pixels passing 
      the criteria of 3%, 3 mm was 94.4 (SD 5.3) for Eclipse vs. Corvus, 85.1 (SD 10.6) 
      for Corvus vs. film, and 93.7 (SD 4.1) for Eclipse vs. film; and for the criteria 
      of 5%, 3 mm, 98.7 (SD 1.5) for Eclipse vs. Corvus, 93.0 (SD 7.8) for Corvus vs. 
      film, and 98.0 (SD 1.9) for Eclipse vs. film. We feel that the use of the Eclipse 
      TPS as an independent, accurate, robust, and time-efficient method for 
      patient-specific IMRT QA is feasible in clinic.

AB  - The present work was carried out to study structural modification of steroids by 
      Geobacillus kaustophilus, a bacterial thermophile present in milk and the 
      environment. Incubation of progesterone and testosterone with G. kaustophilus at 
      65 degrees C resulted in oxygenated steroid nuclei. The oxygenation of the 
      steroid molecule was stereo specific. Seven metabolites of progesterone 
      horizontal line 6beta/6alpha-hydroxytestosterone, 20-hydroxyprogesterone, 
      6beta-/6alpha-20-dihydroxyprogesterone, 5alpha-pregnane-3,6,20-trione, and 
      3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnane-6,20-dione horizontal line were identified. Four 
      compounds horizontal line namely, 66-/6--hydroxytestosterone and 
      6beta/6alpha-hydroxyandrostenedione horizontal line and androst-4-en-3,17-dione 
      were identified as testosterone metabolites. This shows that G. kaustophilus is 
      capable of modifying steroid nuclei at elevated temperatures. G. kaustophilus is 
      a stable thermophile first isolated from milk. Our results show that endogenous 
      steroids present in milk can be modified by G. kaustophilus, causing detrimental 
      effect on human health.

AB  - Bacillus stearothermophilus, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from Kuwaiti 
      desert, when incubated with exogenous progesterone for 10 days at 65 degrees C 
      produced two monohydroxylated, two dihydroxy isomers of progesterone and a B-Seco 
      compound. These metabolites were purified by TLC and HPLC followed by their 
      identification through (1)H, (13)C NMR and other spectroscopic data. Microbial 
      hydroxylation of 17beta-estradiol resulted in the production of estrone. The 
      effect of some inducers resulted in the production of two metabolites from 
      17beta-estradiol one of which was identified as 
      3,6beta,17beta-trihydroxyestra-1,3,5,14(10)-tetrene and the other metabolite 
      remained unidentified. The transformation products were identified through their 
      spectral data and comparison with reference to compounds. Antioxidant activities 
      of progesterone transformed mixture and purified metabolites of 17beta-estradiol 
      were studied by linoleic acid/beta-carotene assay. An enhanced antioxidant 
      activity for progesterone transformation products was observed, when compared to 
      progesterone. A comparison of antioxidant activity of progesterone and 
      17beta-estradiol transformation products is reported.

AB  - Anthracycline antibiotics are widely used in cancer chemotherapy. Doxorubicin and 
      Idarubicin, topoisomerase-targeting anthracyclines, were examined for their 
      effect on chromosomal aberration and micronucleus induction in cultured human 
      lymphocytes employing lymphocyte transformation test and cytokinesis-blocked 
      micronucleus (CBMN) assay. A statistically significant dose-dependent increase in 
      micronucleus frequency (p < 0.001) in binucleated cells was seen as well as a 
      significant increase in chromosomal aberration frequency was also observed for 
      both the drugs. A variety of aberrations were scored including terminal 
      deletions, breaks, gaps, exchanges, fragment formation, ends rejoining, 
      interstitial deletions etc. Nuclear division index was also calculated and showed 
      a cell cycle delay towards higher doses. A number of necrotic and apoptotic cells 
      were also observed at higher concentrations. This confirms the two drugs to be 
      clastogenic and aneugenic.

AB  - In the present study the antigenotoxic effect of apigenin was studied against a 
      genotoxic dose of ethinylestradiol using the damage parameters of chromosomal 
      aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and cell cycle kinetics 
      (CCK). Human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cultured and treated with 10 
      microM of ethinylestradiol along with doses of 5, 10, 15 and 20 microM of 
      apigenin. A clear decrease in the genotoxic damage induced by ethinylestradiol 
      was observed with increasing doses of apigenin, suggesting a protective role for 
      apigenin during ethinylestradiol therapy.

AB  - Broken pellets and fines are produced when pellets are handled. The resistance to 
      air flow was measured for clean pellets and for pellets mixed with 1-20% broken 
      pellets (fines). A pellet diameter was 6mm. The lengths ranged from 6 to 12 mm. 
      Clean pellets were defined as particles that remained on a 4mm screen. A typical 
      sieve analysis showed 30% of the mass of particles that passed through the 4mm 
      screen was smaller than 1mm. The airflow rates used in the experiment ranged from 
      0.004 to 0.357 ms(-1). The corresponding pressure drop ranged from 1.9 to 271 
      Pam(-1) for clean pellets, from 4.8 to 1100 Pam(-1) for 10% fines content, and 
      from 7.9 to 1800 Pam(-1) for 20% fines content. Coefficients of Hukill and Ives' 
      equation were estimated for clean pellets and a multiplier was defined to 
      calculate pressure drop for pellets mixed with fines.

TI  - Comparative study of efficacy, tolerability and compliance of oral iron 
      preparations (iron edetae, iron polymatose complex) and intramuscular iron 
      sorbitol in iron deficiency anaemia in children.
PG  - 764-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy, tolerability and compliance of oral iron 
      preparations (iron edetate and iron polymaltose complex) with each other and with 
      intramuscular iron sorbitol in iron deficiency anaemia in children. METHODS: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) was carried out at the Paediatric Department of 
      Combined Military Hospital (CMH) from January 2006 to December 2007. In total 146 
      children, up to 12 years age having haemoglobin (Hb%) less than 8 gm% were 
      included. They were randomly distributed into three groups. Group A (64 cases) 
      received oral sodium iron edetate (SIE), Group B (40 cases) received oral iron 
      polymaltose complex (IPC) and group C (42cases) received intramuscular iron 
      sorbitol (IS) in recommended dosages. Rise in Hb% > 10gm% was kept as desired 
      target. Maximum duration of treatment planned was 2 weeks for parenteral iron 
      (group C) and 12 weeks for oral iron (groups A and B). Haematological parameters- 
      Hb%, mean corpuscular volum (MCV), mean corpuscuar haemoglobin (MCH), mean 
      corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were measured at induction followed 
      at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks after start of treatment. Compliance 
      and drop out rates were determined on each visit. Data was analyzed using SPSS 
      version10.ANOVA was used to analyze difference in rise in Hb% at various 
      intervals. RESULTS: Statistically significant increase in mean Hb%, MCV, MCHC 
      after 02 weeks was observed in group C (IS). Rise in these parametes became 
      significant in group A (SIE) and B (IPC) after 04 weeks. Peristent rise was 
      observed in oral groups at 08 and 12 weeks. Rise in Hb% was much faster in group 
      C (IS). It took 2 weeks to achieve mean Hb% > 10gm% and compliance rate was 
      40.5%, while to achieve same target, duration required was 8 weeks in group A 
      (SIE) and 12 weeks in group B (IPC) and compliance rate was 39% and 30% 
      respectively. Adverse effects were much more common with group A (SIE) as 
      compared to other two groups. CONCLUSION: Intramuscular iron sorbitol is a 
      reliable and faster alternative modality for treatment of iron deficiency anaemia 
      in children. Short duration of treatment, sure rise in Hb% and minimal adverse 
      effects improve compliance as compared to oral preparations. Among oral 
      preparations, rise in Hb% is more rapid with iron edetae. While IPC gives 
      relatively slower rise in Hb% but side effects are much less as compared to SIE.

LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2010.03.072 [doi]
AB  - A recent report detected association between GPR50, an orphan G protein-coupled 
      receptor, and bipolar disorder (BD) in the Scottish population [29]. We sought to 
      replicate this study in a second sample from the same population, consisting of 
      338 patients with BD, 359 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 913 
      control individuals. In addition, the effect of GPR50 genotype on clinical 
      phenotype and treatment response was assessed in a subset of 56 patients with 
      early onset MDD (eoMDD). We identified an association with BD in women with an 
      intronic SNP, rs1202874, that withstood correction for multiple testing 
      (p=0.0035, permuted p=0.037, OR=1.9, 95%CI 1.2-3.0). However, we failed to find 
      an association with the previously associated Delta502-505 polymorphism (p=0.2). 
      Combined analysis of this and the original samples did detect association between 
      the deletion and susceptibility to BD in females, but with a reduced effect size 
      (p=0.0006, permuted p=0.0024, OR=1.41, 95%CI 1.16-1.71). In the highly phenotyped 
      eoMDD subgroup, we found an association between the Delta502-505 deletion 
      polymorphism and age of onset (p=0.049), number of episodes (p=0.044), hypomanic 
      symptoms (p=0.019), and initial thinking time (p=0.027), in women; and in family 
      history of depression in men (p=0.038), uncorrected for multiple testing. No 
      association was seen between Delta502-505 genotype and treatment response at 3 
      months. To our knowledge this is the first association of rs1202874 with BD and 
      is the second positive association at the GPR50 locus.

TI  - Oral misoprostol for induction of labour.
PG  - 102-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of oral Misoprostol in labour induction with 
      respect to ease of administration and induction-to-delivery time interval. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Observational study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Gynaecology/Obstetrics 
      Department, Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi, from March to August 2006. 
      METHODOLOGY: Women with live singleton pregnancy of > 37 weeks gestation with 
      cephalic presentation, with an indication for induction of labour were inducted. 
      Oral misoprostol 50 microg to 400 microg was given in divided doses at 4 hours 
      interval upto a maximum of 4 doses, till labour was induced. Fetomaternal outcome 
      and induction to delivering time interval in hours was noted. RESULTS: In 6 
      months duration, 250 mothers were recruited for the study. The main indication 
      for labour induction was post date pregnancy (52%) and oxytocin was given in 50% 
      cases. The majority (96%) of mothers went into labour but 4% (9) had failed 
      induction. The majority (73%, n=176/241) of mothers delivered vaginally, 99% 
      being delivered in the first 24 hours. Mean induction-delivery interval was 
      11+/-2.7 hours. Sixty five (27%) had to undergo emergency lower segment caesarean 
      section, the major indication being fetal distress (41.5%, n=27) and meconium 
      staining of liquor (40%, n=26). Again, a majority (95%) of the babies were 
      delivered with good Apgar score. However, 10.8% developed meconium aspiration 
      syndrome. Early neonatal deaths occurred in 0.8% (2) cases. Maternal hyper 
      stimulation was seen in 1 case (0.4%). CONCLUSION: Oral misoprostol as an agent 
      for labour induction in term pregnancy was easy to administer and the majority of 
      women (99%) delivered in the first 24 hours.

TI  - Differential proteomic analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes exhibiting 
      resistance or susceptibility to the insect herbivore, Plutella xylostella.

LID - e10103
AB  - A proteomic study was conducted to investigate physiological factors affecting 
      feeding behaviour by larvae of the insect, Plutella xylostella, on 
      herbivore-susceptible and herbivore-resistant Arabidopsis thaliana. The leaves of 
      162 recombinant inbred lines (Rils) were screened to detect genotypes upon which 
      Plutella larvae fed least (P. xylostella-resistant) or most (P. 
      xylostella-susceptible). 2D-PAGE revealed significant differences in the 
      proteomes between the identified resistant and susceptible Rils. The proteomic 
      results, together with detection of increased production of hydrogen peroxide in 
      resistant Rils, suggest a correlation between P. xylostella resistance and the 
      production of increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in particular 
      H2O2, and that this was expressed prior to herbivory. Many of the proteins that 
      were more abundant in the Plutella-resistant Rils are known in other biological 
      systems to be involved in limiting ROS damage. Such proteins included carbonic 
      anhydrases, malate dehydrogenases, glutathione S-transferases, isocitrate 
      dehydrogenase-like protein (R1), and lipoamide dehydrogenase. In addition, 
      patterns of germin-like protein 3 isoforms could also be indicative of higher 
      levels of reactive oxygen species in the resistant Rils. Consistent with the 
      occurrence of greater oxidative stress in the resistant Rils is the observation 
      of greater abundance in susceptible Rils of polypeptides of the photosynthetic 
      oxygen-evolving complex, which are known to be damaged under oxidative stress. 
      The combined results suggest that enhanced production of ROS may be a major 
      pre-existing mechanism of Plutella resistance in Arabidopsis, but definitive 
      corroboration of this requires much further work.

TI  - Bactericidal effect of grape seed extract on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA).
PG  - 357-64
AB  - This study was conducted to measure the antibacterial activity of grape (Vitis 
      vinifera L; Vitaceae) seed extract against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      aureus (MRSA). Grape seed and skin extracts were tested for antibacterial 
      activity against forty-three strains of MRSA by gel diffusion, growth and 
      respirometric studies. All MRSA strains were found to be sensitive to grape seed 
      extract. Complete inhibition of all bacterial strains tested was observed at a 
      concentration of 3 mg/ml crude grape seed proanthocyanidins extract (GPSE), 
      equivalent of 20.7 microg/ml flavonoid content. Antibacterial activity was 
      bactericidal as shown by a disruption of the bacterial cell wall in scanning and 
      transmission electron microscopy. Grape seed extract is known to be rich in 
      potent antioxidant polyphenolics that could show antibacterial activity. Phenolic 
      compounds in the grape seed extract were assayed by Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent. 
      The considerable antibacterial activity of commonly available grape seed extract 
      could signify a major advancement in the treatment of MRSA diseases.

AB  - AIMS: To assess the degradation potential and plant colonization capacity of four 
      alkane-degrading strains (ITSI10, ITRI15, ITRH76 and BTRH79) in combination with 
      birdsfoot trefoil and Italian ryegrass and to evaluate the diversity of 
      indigenous alkane-degrading soil bacteria in the rhizo- and endosphere. METHODS 
      AND RESULTS: Contaminated soil was prepared by spiking agricultural soil with 10 
      g diesel fuel per kg soil. Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. Taurus) and 
      birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus var. Leo) were inoculated with four 
      alkane-degrading strains. Hydrocarbon degradation (up to 57%) was observed in all 
      inoculated treatments of vegetated and unvegetated samples. Italian ryegrass in 
      combination with compost and BTRH79 showed highest degradation, while birdsfoot 
      trefoil performed best with compost and strain ITSI10. Cultivation-based as well 
      as cultivation-independent analysis showed that both strains were competitive 
      colonizers. CONCLUSIONS: The combination between vegetation, inoculation with 
      well-performing degrading bacteria and compost amendment was an efficient 
      approach to reduce hydrocarbon contamination. Two Pantoea sp. strains, ITSI10 and 
      BTRH79, established well in the plant environment despite the presence of a 
      variety of other, indigenous alkane-degrading bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT 
      OF THE STUDY: This study suggests that the application of degrading bacterial 
      strains, which are able to compete with the native microflora and to tightly 
      associate with plants, are promising candidates to be used for phytoremediation 
      applications.

TI  - Effects of variation of MRI parameters on signal homogeneity: a qualitative 
      analysis for ferrous benzoic xylenon orange gel.
PG  - 470-3
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study focuses on the diverse effects of MRI parameters on image 
      quality using widely available imaging pulse sequences. METHODS: A tissue 
      equivalent gel system has been used for Magnetic Resonance Imaging by using 
      Xylenol orange dye with Fricke-Benzoic solution which was formulated by Kelly R.G 
      (1998). The gel system was radiated while using 6MV photons from Varian Clinic 
      Linear Accelerator. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis include the effect of TR 
      and TE on signal nonuniformity according to which the escalating repetition time 
      gives a uniform signal having the average values calculated are 0.76%, 0.83%, 
      1.43% and 1.89% for the conventional spin echo (CSE), fast spin echo (FSE), 
      gradient recalled echo (GRE) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) 
      respectively. FLAIR showed contradictory results due to longitudinal relaxation 
      of the signal. This is because, at the longer value of inversion time (TI), the 
      signal from simple fluids is nulled, thus reducing signal intensity. CONCLUSION: 
      The evaluation of signal uniformity for different pulse sequences demonstrates 
      that the repetition time (TR) affects the signal homogeneity as it maintains 
      image quality for CSE and FSE. However, a careful selection is required for FLAIR 
      due to its sensitive behaviour for image uniformity.

      contraceptive.
PG  - 536-40
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine Patient Satisfaction of DMPA-SC (104 mg/0.65 mL) injected 
      subcutaneously once every 3 months. METHODS: It was a Descriptive case series 
      with the centre in Rawalpindi (Holy Family Hospital, Gynecology and Obstetrics 
      Unit), Pakistan. Twenty five patients were selected by purposive sampling and 
      followed up in Rawalpindi center (Holy Family Hospital, Gynaecology and Obstetric 
      Unit) for one year as a part of the Asian Trial These patients had successfully 
      completed their contraception using DMPA-sc at 3 months interval. Hospital 
      Ethical Committee Permission was obtained prior to commencement of study. 
      Informed written consent was taken from the patients. Body weight was measured at 
      baseline and every 3 months thereafter. Bleeding analysis was also done at 3 
      months interval using a 5 point scale based on patient's own records. Participant 
      satisfaction with treatment results was evaluated using a patient satisfaction 
      questionnaire (PSQ). It collected data regarding the respondent's experience with 
      the study, the aspects of treatment that were liked and disliked and the 
      likelihood of selecting that method for future contraceptive purposes. RESULTS: 
      Out of twenty five, 15 (60%) patients had a high inclination Six (24%) patients 
      and 9 (36%) very highly likely to use this contraceptive method in future. Eleven 
      (44%) women replied that the probability of recommending this contraceptive 
      method to their friends was very highly likely. CONCLUSIONS: DMPA-SC has a very 
      high percentage score of Patient Satisfaction for the contraceptive method as 
      well as its likelihood of selecting it in future (JPMA 60:536; 2010).

      genotoxic effect in the presence of metabolic activation and was found to be 
      genotoxic at 20 and 40 microM. Approximately 20 microM of estradiol-17beta was 
      treated along with 5, 10 and 15 microM of allicin, separately, in the presence of 
      metabolic activation. Similar treatments were given with 40 microM of 
      estradiol-17beta. Treatments along with allicin result in the reduction of CAs 
      and SCEs, suggesting its anti-genotoxic activity in human lymphocytes in vitro 
      against estradiol-17beta-induced genotoxic damage.

AB  - We report on a 25-year follow-up of a Pakistani kindred with a unique combination 
      of camptodactyly and clinodactyly of 5th fingers, mesoaxial camptodactyly of 
      toes, and ulnar deviation of 3rd fingers. The less common anomalies in the 
      affected subjects include syndactyly involving all digits, and bifid toes. This 
      condition is grossly bilateral, symmetrical, and affects upper and lower limbs of 
      the 26 affected subjects in the kindred. The comparable number of affected male 
      and female subjects (chi(2) = 0.154, P < 0.1), disease allele transmission by 
      mother and father, and the malformation segregation in four consecutive 
      generations are strongly suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. 
      Differential diagnosis considered syndactyly types II, III, and V. Only type II 
      syndactyly manifests noticeable phenotypic overlap with the clinical presentation 
      in this family; however, the typical type II syndactyly changes are absent. To 
      the best of our knowledge, this autosomal dominant limb phenotype has not been 
      reported previously.

TI  - Expression and epigenetic modulation of sonic hedgehog-GLI1 pathway genes in 
      neuroblastoma cell lines and tumors.
PG  - 113-27
LID - 10.1007/s13277-010-0105-x [doi]
AB  - It is well known that sonic hedgehog signaling pathway plays a vital role during 
      early embryonic development. It is also responsible for stem cell renewal and 
      development of several cancers like colorectal and breast carcinoma and major 
      brain tumors as medulloblastoma and glioblastoma. The role of sonic hedgehog 
      signaling in the development of neuroblastoma has not been thoroughly 
      investigated. In this study, we attempted to determine the expression of Bmi-1 
      stem cell marker and of Shh pathway downstream target genes glioma-associated 
      oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1), protein patched homolog 1 (PTCH1), Cyclin D2, 
      plakoglobin (gamma catenin), NK2 homeobox 2 (NKX2.2), paired box gene 6 (PAX6), 
      secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), and hedgehog interacting protein 
      (HHIP) in 11 neuroblastoma cell lines and 41 neuroblastoma samples. Also, 
      inhibition of the pathway was performed genetically by GLI1 knockdown siRNA or 
      chemically by cyclopamine. After inhibition, low transcript expression was 
      detected in downstream target genes like PTCH1, in the cell lines. We further 
      preformed promoter methylation studies of Cyclin D2, PTCH1, HHIP, and SFRP1 genes 
      by melting curve analysis-based methylation assay (MCA-Meth) and 
      methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Results revealed no methylation in Cyclin D2 gene 
      promoter in neuroblastoma samples or in cell lines; one cell line (MHH-NB-11) 
      showed PTCH1 methylation; 3/11 (27%) cell lines and 9/41 (22%) neuroblastoma 
      samples showed HHIP methylation; and 3/11 (27%) cell lines and 11/41 (27%) 
      samples showed SFRP1 methylation. Taken together, our results suggest the 
      possibility of two levels of control of the sonic hedgehog signaling pathway: 
      transcriptional and epigenetic, which might offer new therapeutic possibilities 
      to modulate the pathway and try to suppress tumor growth.

PG  - 287-96
LID - 10.1007/s11060-010-0401-8 [doi]
AB  - Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric brain tumor and its development is 
      affected by genetic and epigenetic factors. In this study we found there is low 
      or no expression of the hedgehog interacting protein (HHIP), a negative regulator 
      of the sonic hedgehog pathway, in most medulloblastoma cell lines and primary 
      samples explored. We proceeded to promoter methylation assays of this gene by 
      MCA-Meth, and found that HHIP was hypermethylated in all medulloblastoma cell 
      lines, but only in 2 out of 14 (14%) primary tumor samples. Methylation 
      correlated with low or unexpressed HHIP in cell lines but not in primary tumor 
      samples. These results suggest the possibility of epigenetic regulation of HHIP 
      in medulloblastoma, similarly to gastric, hepatic and pancreatic cancer. However, 
      HHIP seems to be not only under regulation of promoter methylation, but under 
      other factors involved in the control of its low levels of expression in 
      medulloblastoma.

PG  - 678-88
LID - 10.1016/j.nutres.2010.09.009 [doi]
AB  - Irregularities of serotonin function in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) may be due 
      to changes in the metabolism of the serotonin precursor l-tryptophan. Dietary 
      alteration of tryptophan intake may impact upon the mood and bowel symptoms of 
      IBS. We hypothesized that diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (d-IBS) 
      patients would exhibit an increase in plasma tryptophan due to alterations in 
      tryptophan metabolism. We also hypothesized that a diet low in tryptophan would 
      reverse this change and reduce symptoms. Thirteen patients with d-IBS had fasting 
      serum free and total tryptophan, large neutral amino acids, and 6 kynurenine 
      metabolites measured before and after 2 weeks of a strict dairy-free diet. 
      Baseline tryptophan parameters were compared with an age- and sex-matched control 
      group. Changes in the specific tryptophan parameters before and after dairy-free 
      diet were correlated with symptoms of IBS and mood. Compared with the control 
      group, d-IBS patients at baseline exhibited significantly higher free serum 
      tryptophan (10.5 +/- 4.35 vs 4.75 +/- 2.43 mumol/L [means +/- standard deviation], P = 
      .006) and significantly lower tryptophan dioxygenase and total tryptophan 
      oxidation as measured by the kynurenine to free tryptophan and total kynurenines 
      to free tryptophan ratios (23.37 +/- 10.12 vs 55.33 +/- 16.02, P < .001 and 49.34 +/- 
      17.84 vs 258.46 +/- 98.67, P < .001, respectively). Dairy-free diet did not 
      modulate metabolites of the kynurenine pathway or symptoms. Tryptophan metabolism 
      along the kynurenine pathway is inhibited in d-IBS, and a dairy-free diet does 
      not alter this. Our findings are consistent with possible enhanced serotonin 
      activity in d-IBS.

      astrocytoma.
PG  - 614
LID - 10.1186/1471-2407-10-614 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling pathway is critical for cell 
      growth and differentiation. Impairment of this pathway can result in both birth 
      defects and cancer. Despite its importance in cancer development, the Shh pathway 
      has not been thoroughly investigated in tumorigenesis of brain tumors. In this 
      study, we sought to understand the regulatory roles of GLI1, the immediate 
      downstream activator of the Shh signaling pathway on its downstream target genes 
      PTCH1, Cyclin D2, Plakoglobin, NKX2.2 and PAX6 in medulloblastoma and astrocytic 
      tumors. METHODS: We silenced GLI1 expression in medulloblastoma and astrocytic 
      cell lines by transfection of siRNA against GLI1. Subsequently, we performed 
      RT-PCR and quantitative real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to assay the expression of 
      downstream target genes PTCH1, Cyclin D2, Plakoglobin, NKX2.2 and PAX6. We also 
      attempted to correlate the pattern of expression of GLI1 and its regulated genes 
      in 14 cell lines and 41 primary medulloblastoma and astrocytoma tumor samples. We 
      also assessed the methylation status of the Cyclin D2 and PTCH1 promoters in 
      these 14 cell lines and 58 primary tumor samples. RESULTS: Silencing expression 
      of GLI1 resulted up-regulation of all target genes in the medulloblastoma cell 
      line, while only PTCH1 was up-regulated in astrocytoma. We also observed 
      methylation of the cyclin D2 promoter in a significant number of astrocytoma cell 
      lines (63%) and primary astrocytoma tumor samples (32%), but not at all in any 
      medulloblastoma samples. PTCH1 promoter methylation was less frequently observed 
      than Cyclin D2 promoter methylation in astrocytomas, and not at all in 
      medulloblastomas. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate different regulatory 
      mechanisms of Shh-GLI1 signaling. These differences vary according to the 
      downstream target gene affected, the origin of the tissue, as well as epigenetic 
      regulation of some of these genes.

AB  - The combined use of plants and associated microorganisms has great potential for 
      cleaning up soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. Apart from 
      environmental conditions the physicochemical properties of the soil are the main 
      factors influencing the survival and activity of an inoculated strain as well as 
      the growth of plants. This study examined the effect of different soil types 
      (sandy, loamy sand and loam) on the survival, gene abundance and catabolic gene 
      expression of two inoculated strains (Pseudomonas sp. strain ITRI53 and Pantoea 
      sp. strain BTRH79) in the rhizosphere and shoot interior of Italian ryegrass 
      vegetated in diesel contaminated soils. High colonization, gene abundance and 
      expression in loamy soils were observed. By contrast, low colonization, gene 
      abundance and absence of gene expression in sandy soil were found. The highest 
      levels of genes expression and hydrocarbon degradation were seen in loamy soil 
      that had been inoculated with BTRH79 and were significantly higher compared to 
      those in other soils. A positive correlation was observed between gene expression 
      and hydrocarbon degradation indicating that catabolic gene expression is 
      necessary for contaminant degradation. These results suggest that soil type 
      influences the bacterial colonization and microbial activities and subsequently 
      the efficiency of contaminant degradation.

TI  - Mi-DISCOVERER: A bioinformatics tool for the detection of mi-RNA in human genome.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 22 nucleotides non-coding RNAs that play pivotal 
      regulatory roles in diverse organisms including the humans and are difficult to 
      be identified due to lack of either sequence features or robust algorithms to 
      efficiently identify. Therefore, we made a tool that is Mi-Discoverer for the 
      detection of miRNAs in human genome. The tools used for the development of 
      software are Microsoft Office Access 2003, the JDK version 1.6.0, BioJava version 
      1.0, and the NetBeans IDE version 6.0. All already made miRNAs softwares were web 
      based; so the advantage of our project was to make a desktop facility to the user 
      for sequence alignment search with already identified miRNAs of human genome 
      present in the database. The user can also insert and update the newly discovered 
      human miRNA in the database. Mi-Discoverer, a bioinformatics tool successfully 
      identifies human miRNAs based on multiple sequence alignment searches. It's a non 
      redundant database containing a large collection of publicly available human 
      miRNAs.

AB  - There are two mol-ecules in the asymmetric unit of the title compound, 
      C(14)H(11)N(3)OS. In each, the benzimidazole ring system is essentially planar, 
      with maximum deviations of 0.010 (2) and 0.006 (2) A, and makes dihedral angles 
      of 8.70 (9) and 13.75 (8) degrees , respectively, with the hy-droxy-substituted benzene 
      rings. Each mol-ecule adopts an E configuration about the central C=N double 
      bond. In the crystal, the two independent mol-ecules are connected via 
      inter-molecular N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredS hydrogen bonds, forming dimers. Furthermore, the dimers are 
      connected by N-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO hydrogen bonds into mol-ecular ribbons along the c axis. There 
      is an intra-molecular O-Hcdots, three dots, centeredN hydrogen bond in each mol-ecule, which generates an 
      S(6) ring motif.

AB  - This review focuses primarily on the complexities of chronotoxicity and 
      chronopharmacology (time-of-day effects on the metabolism of environmental 
      chemicals and therapeutic agents as related to chronobiology). The nature of the 
      melatonin signal may modify the function of the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum 
      resulting in variations in the metabolism of xenobiotic chemicals. Concepts are 
      explored for modification of exposure limits and/or Threshold Limit Values (TLVs) 
      of industrial chemicals in risk assessment and health effects of workers on 
      rotating shifts. The TLVs of chemicals may be changed during work shift schedules 
      to minimize adverse health effects among workers.

PG  - 161-93
LID - 10.1515/DMDI.1997.13.3.161 [doi]
AB  - The toxicity of chemicals, and of reactive oxygen species (ROS), are both 
      affected by nutrition and diet. Calorific excess (continuous feeding), or 
      deficiency (fasting), may increase production of ROS, which are also formed by 
      interaction of toxic chemicals with cytochromes P450 (CYP2E or futile cycling). 
      Both ROS (GSH reductase and peroxidase) and toxic chemicals (S-transferases) are 
      detoxified by GSH enzymes; ROS are scavenged by a system comprising GSH, ascorbic 
      acid and tocopherols, which may be regenerated by NADPH. Dietary protein is 
      necessary for GSH or enzyme replacement, lipids are required for polyunsaturated 
      fatty acids (PUFAs) and prostanoid biosynthesis, lipotropes and phospholipids for 
      synthesis of endoplasmic reticulum, and folate is needed for dug metabolizing 
      activity. Among required minerals, Se is necessary as the essential component of 
      the antioxidant enzyme, glutathione peroxidase. Other dietary factors considered 
      are the natural toxicants, gossypol, lathyrogens, glucosinolates, and saponins, 
      and toxicants from food spoilage, food intoxication and food processing.

AB  - The genus Enterobacter comprises a range of beneficial plant-associated bacteria 
      showing plant growth promotion. Enterobacter ludwigii belongs to the Enterobacter 
      cloacae complex and has been reported to include human pathogens but also 
      plant-associated strains with plant beneficial capacities. To assess the role of 
      Enterobacter endophytes in hydrocarbon degradation, plant colonization, abundance 
      and expression of CYP153 genes in different plant compartments, three plant 
      species (Italian ryegrass, birdsfoot trefoil and alfalfa) were grown in sterile 
      soil spiked with 1% diesel and inoculated with three endophytic E. ludwigii 
      strains. Results showed that all strains were capable of hydrocarbon degradation 
      and efficiently colonized the rhizosphere and plant interior. Two strains, 
      ISI10-3 and BRI10-9, showed highest degradation rates of diesel fuel up to 68% 
      and performed best in combination with Italian ryegrass and alfalfa. All strains 
      expressed the CYP153 gene in all plant compartments, indicating an active role in 
      degradation of diesel in association with plants.

TI  - Frequency of otitis media in patients of nasal polypi.
PG  - 83-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis media is a common disease encountered in ENT practice. Its 
      incidence has fallen in the developed world. It is expected that nasal polypi 
      causes Eustachian tube dysfunction which in turn leads to negative middle ear 
      pressure causing to develop otitis media with effusion or recurrent otitis media. 
      The objective of this study was to find the frequency of Otitis Media in patients 
      of nasal polypi. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study. Seventy 
      patients with bilateral nasal polypi were taken for study from OPD of ENT 
      Department, Fauji Foundation Hospital Rawalpindi. Purposive (non-probability) 
      sampling was done keeping p=4%. There were 24 (34.3%) males and 46 (65.7%) 
      females included in the study. Age range was 26-38 years. Tympanometry was done 
      in every patient to look for signs of Otitis media. Duration of study was from 
      24th Apr 2008 to 30th Jul 2009. RESULTS: In our study, all patients were having 
      bilateral nasal polypi. Age range was between 26 and 38 years. Frequency of 
      patients having retracted tympanic membrane on right side was 25 (35.7%), and 
      those who developed it on left side was 30 (42.9%). However, 35 (50%) of the 70 
      patients were having retraction of tympanic membrane whether right or left. This 
      shows frequency of otitis media in patients of nasal polypi was found to be 50%. 
      CONCLUSION: Frequency of developing otitis media in patients of nasal polypi is

TI  - Transformation of chenodeoxycholic acid by thermophilic Geobacillus 
      stearothermophilus.
PG  - 250-5
LID - 10.1002/bab.34 [doi]
AB  - We performed a series of experiments with Geobacillus stearothermophilus, a 
      thermophile isolated from oil-contaminated soil in the Kuwaiti desert. The 
      organism has a good potential for the transformation of a broad spectrum of 
      organic molecules such as steroids, amino acids, and aromatic hydrocarbons. In 
      the present study, we tested its potential for the transformation of a bile 
      component, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA). Five transformed products, namely, 
      cholic acid, methylcholate, methylchenodeoxycholate, 3alpha-hydroxy-7-oxo-5beta-cholanic 
      acid, and 7alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-5beta-cholanic acid, were the major transformation 
      products catalyzed by G. stearothermophilus. Under aerobic conditions, no 
      evidence of side chain degradation, ring cleavage, or dehydrogenation was found 
      among the metabolites of CDCA. CDCA transformation by a thermophile is reported 
      for the first time.

TI  - Global Health Workforce Alliance: increasing the momentum for health workforce 
      development.
PG  - 298-307
LID - S1726-46342011000200018 [pii]
AB  - The Global Health Workforce Alliance was launched in 2006 to provide a joint 
      platform for governments, development partners, international agencies, civil 
      society organizations, academia, private sector, professional associations, and 
      other stakeholders to work together to address a global crisis in human resources 
      for health. Five years later the vision and mandate of the Alliance still remain 
      valid. Despite advances in bringing the health workforce to the fore in 
      international health policy arenas, more available knowledge and tools, and 
      encouraging signs of commitments from many countries, health workforce 
      bottlenecks continue to prevent many health systems from delivering essential and 
      quality health services. Latin America is not spared from the challenges. The 
      2010 Second Global Forum on Human Resources for Health provided an opportunity to 
      review progress, identify persisting gaps, reach consensus on solutions, and 
      renew the momentum for and commitment to acutely needed investment and actions.

TI  - Gene diversity for haptoglobin and transferrin classical markers among Hindu and 
      Muslim populations of Aligarh City, India.
PG  - 842-6
AB  - The present paper reports the distribution of serum protein markers viz. 
      haptoglobin and transferrin in two major groups of Aligarh city of North India. 
      In present study we have undertaken a survey of 538 individuals belonging to 
      eight different populations, four from the Hindu community i.e. Brahmin, Bania, 
      Rajput and Jatav, and the rest four among the Muslim community i.e. Syed, Sheikh, 
      Pathan and Ansari. The heterozygosity ranged from 0.2939 (Ansari) to 0.4873 
      (Brahmin) for haptoglobin and from 0.000 (Rajput) to 0.1498 (Pathan) for 
      transferrin. The values of D(ST) are 0.4122 and 0.4406, and that of G(ST) are 
      0.5059 and 0.9726 for haptoglobin and transferrin markers respectively. Through 
      F(ST) test, it has been concluded that there is a high genetic differentiation of 
      populations within Hindu and Muslim groups, though there is absence of any 
      significant differences between these groups.

TI  - Effect of diet on preweaning performance of Sahiwal calves.
PG  - 819-26
LID - 10.1007/s11250-011-9973-3 [doi]
AB  - The objective was to study the growth potential of Sahiwal calves given milk or 
      milk replacer with or without concentrates. For this purpose, forty-eight Sahiwal 
      calves were divided into four groups of 12 animals each with equal sex ratio. In 
      each group, the calves were offered either milk or a milk replacer (MR) at a rate 
      of 10% of their body weight adjusted weekly. In addition to this, calves were fed 
      either a starter ration plus Egyptian clover hay (SR + H) or hay only (H) until 
      the end of trial. The milk or MR was withdrawn gradually from day 56 until 
      animals were weaned completely by day 84. Calves offered milk grew faster than 
      those offered MR (357 +/- 9 vs. 162 +/- 9 g/day; p < 0.05) and displayed higher 
      weaning weights (51.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 35.2 +/- 0.8 kg; p < 0.05). The calves offered SR + 
      H grew faster (311 +/- 9 vs. 208 +/- 9 g/day; p < 0.05) and displayed higher weaning 
      weights (48.7 +/- 0.8 vs. 38.1 +/- 0.8 kg; p < 0.05) than those fed H alone. Calves 
      offered milk plus SR + H showed the highest growth rate and weaning weights (401 
      +/- 13 g/day and 56.3 +/- 1 kg, respectively). The lowest growth rate and weaning 
      weights were observed in calves offered MR and H only (115 +/- 13 g/day and 30.3 +/- 
      1 kg, respectively). Calves offered the MR had higher number of scour days than 
      those offered milk (13.5 vs. 3.3). The feeding of whole milk in combination with 
      the starter ration and hay resulted in superior growth rates, higher weaning 
      weights, and healthier calves than the other feeding regimens.

TI  - Antigenotoxic effect of the Plumbago zeylanica extract against the genotoxic 
      damage induced by potassium canrenoate in cultured human peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes.
PG  - 119-26
LID - 10.3109/01480545.2011.589443 [doi]
AB  - In India, natural preparations derived from the plants are widely use for the 
      treatments of various diseases. Hence, it becomes necessary to assess the 
      modulating action of the plant extract when associated with other substances. 
      Potassium canrenoate (PC) is a synthetic steroid and is used in the treatment of 
      hypertension. It is not only a genotoxic agent, but also a tumor-initiating 
      agent. In the present study, the effect of various doses (i.e., 5, 10, 20, and 30 
      microM) of PC were studied for their genotoxic effects in the presence of S9 mix in 
      cultured human lymphocytes, using mitotic index, chromosomal aberrations, sister 
      chromatid exchanges, and replication index as parameters. PC was found to be 
      genotoxic at 20 and 30 microM. Treatment of 30 microM of PC was given along with 
      different doses of Plumbago zeylanica extract (i.e., 107.5, 212.5, 315, and 417 
      microg/mL) of the culture medium. A dose-dependent decrease in the genotoxic effects 
      of PC was observed. The result suggested that the plant extract per se does not 
      have genotoxic potential, but can modulate the genotoxicity of PC in cultured 
      human lymphocytes.

      contemporary viewpoint.
PG  - 48-62
AB  - Psoriasis is a common chronic autoimmune skin disorder with T-cell mediated 
      multifunctional complex pathogenesis along with genetic predisposition. 
      Conventionally, many therapies are available for the management of psoriasis, but 
      they have limited efficacy due to higher side effects. Over the last decade, one 
      of the major efforts in psoriasis research has been made for the development of 
      drug molecules by understanding the potential biomolecules/biomarkers associated 
      with psoriasis. This approach aims to provide selective immunologically directed 
      intervention with fewer side effects than conventional therapies. The present 
      review aims to give an exhaustive account on various biomarkers including 
      oxidative stress, peptide, biochemical and gene markers responsible for 
      keratocyte hyper proliferation, inflammatory responses and abnormal 
      differentiation in psoriasis. Effective targeting of these over expressed 
      biomarkers can serve as the novel tool for anti-psoriatic drug development. In 
      addition, this review also gives insights into several novel biomarkers targeted 
      drugs under pre-clinical and clinical investigation or have been registered by 
      FDA for psoriasis management.

TI  - Effect of methyl methanesulfonate on hsp70 expression and tissue damage in the 
      third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg.
PG  - 159-65
LID - 10.2478/v10102-011-0025-7 [doi]
AB  - Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is an anti-carcinogenic drug and its toxicity has 
      been reported in various experimental models. The hsp70s are a family of 
      ubiquitously expressed heat shock proteins. In the recent years, hsp70 has been 
      considered to be one of the candidate genes for predicting cytotoxicity against 
      environmental chemicals. Nowadays emphasis is given to the use of alternatives to 
      mammals in testing, research and education. The European Centre for the 
      Validation of Alternative Methods (EVCAM) has recommended the use of Drosophila 
      as an alternative model for scientific studies. Almost all living organisms 
      possess proteins with a similar structure to that of hsp70s. In the present 
      study, the toxicity of MMS was evaluated by quantifying hsp70 expression and 
      tissue damage in the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster 
      (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9), at different doses and hours of exposure. We studied the 
      effect of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 microl/ml of MMS at 2, 4, 24 and 48 hours of 
      exposure on hsp70 expression by using the soluble 
      O-nitrophenyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside (ONPG) assay and on establishing the tissue 
      damage by the Trypan blue exclusion assay in the third instar larvae of 
      transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9). A dose-dependent increase 
      in the expression of hsp70 was observed at 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75 microl/ml of MMS 
      compared to the control. At the highest dose, i.e. 1.0 microl/ml of MMS, the activity 
      of hsp70 was decreased due to tissue damage.

TI  - Tryptophan oxidative metabolism catalyzed by geobacillus stearothermophilus: a 
      thermophile isolated from kuwait soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.4137/IJTR.S6457 [doi]
AB  - Tryptophan metabolism has been extensively studied in humans as well as in soil. 
      Its metabolism takes place mainly through kynurenine pathway yielding 
      hydroxylated, deaminated and many other products of physiological significance. 
      However, tryptophan metabolism has not been studied in an isolated thermophilic 
      bacterium. Geobacillus stearothermophilus is a local thermophile isolated from 
      Kuwait desert soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. The bacterium grows 
      well at 65  degrees C in 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7), when supplied with organic 
      compounds as a carbon source and has a good potential for transformation of 
      steroids and related molecules. In the present study, we used tryptophan ethyl 
      ester as a carbon source for the bacterium to study the catabolism of the amino 
      acid at pH 5 and pH 7. In this endeavor, we have resolved twenty one 
      transformation products of tryptophan by GC/LC and have identified them through 
      their mass spectral fragmentation.

      extracts from leaves, flowers and bark of Gold Mohar [Delonix regia (Bojer ex 
      Hook.) Raf].
PG  - 7302-19
LID - 10.3390/molecules16097302 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and phenolic 
      components of different solvent (absolute methanol, absolute ethanol, absolute 
      acetone, 80% methanol, 80% ethanol, 80% acetone and deionized water) extracts of 
      leaves, flowers and bark of Gold Mohar [Delonix regia (Bojer ex Hook.) Raf.]. The 
      extract yields from leaves, flowers and bark ranged from 10.19 to 36.24, 12.97 to 
      48.47 and 4.22 to 8.48 g/100 g dry weight (DW), respectively. Overall, 80% 
      methanol extract produced from the leaves exhibited significantly (P < 0.05) 
      higher antioxidant activity, with high phenolic contents (3.63 g GAE/100 g DW), 
      total flavonoid contents (1.19 g CE/100 g DW), inhibition of peroxidation 
      (85.54%), DPPH scavenging capacity (IC(50) value 8.89 mug/mL) and reducing power 
      (1.87). Similarly, this 80% methanol leaves extract also showed superior 
      antimicrobial activity. HPLC analysis of the 80% methanol extracts for individual 
      phenolics revealed the presence of gallic, protocatechuic and salicylic acid in 
      leaves; gallic, protocatechuic, salicylic, trans-cinnamic and chlorogenic acid in 
      flowers, and gallic acid in bark as the main (amount > 1.50 mg/100 g DW) phenolic 
      acids. Besides, small amounts ( < 1.50 mg/100 g DW) of some other phenolic acids 
      such as sorbic, sinapic, p-coumaric, m-coumaric, ferulic, caffeic, 
      3-hydroxybenzoic, 4-hydroxycinnamic and 4-hydroxybenzoic acids were also 
      detected. The extracts of the tested parts of Gold Mohar, especially, the leaves, 
      might be valuable for functional food and therapeutic applications.

TI  - Can the risk of secondary cancer induction after breast conserving therapy be 
      reduced using intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) with low-energy x-rays?
PG  - 174
LID - 10.1186/1748-717X-6-174 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiation induced secondary cancers are a rare but severe late effect 
      after breast conserving therapy. Intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) is 
      increasingly used during breast conserving surgery. The purpose of this analysis 
      was to estimate secondary cancer risks after IORT compared to other modalities of 
      breast radiotherapy (APBI - accelerated partial breast irradiation, EBRT - 
      external beam radiotherapy). METHODS: Computer-tomography scans of an 
      anthropomorphic phantom were acquired with an INTRABEAM IORT applicator (diameter 
      4 cm) in the outer quadrant of the breast and transferred via DICOM to the 
      treatment planning system. Ipsilateral breast, contralateral breast, ipsilateral 
      lung, contralateral lung, spine and heart were contoured. An INTRABEAM source (50 
      kV) was defined with the tip of the drift tube at the center of the spherical 
      applicator. A dose of 20 Gy at 0 mm depth from the applicator surface was 
      prescribed for IORT and 34 Gy (5 days x 2 x 3.4 Gy) at 10 mm depth for APBI. For 
      EBRT a total dose of 50 Gy in 2 Gy fractions was planned using two tangential 
      fields with wedges. The mean and maximal doses, DVHs and volumes receiving more 
      than 0.1 Gy and 4 Gy of organs at risk (OAR) were calculated and compared. The 
      life time risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to NCRP report 116. 
      RESULTS: IORT delivered the lowest maximal doses to contralateral breast (< 0.3 
      Gy), ipsilateral (1.8 Gy) and contralateral lung (< 0.3 Gy), heart (1 Gy) and 
      spine (< 0.3 Gy). In comparison, maximal doses for APBI were 2-5 times higher. 
      EBRT delivered a maximal dose of 10.4 Gy to the contralateral breast and 53 Gy to 
      the ipsilateral lung. OAR volumes receiving more than 4 Gy were 0% for IORT, < 2% 
      for APBI and up to 10% for EBRT (ipsilateral lung). The estimated risk for 
      secondary cancer in the respective OAR is considerably lower after IORT and/or 
      APBI as compared to EBRT. CONCLUSIONS: The calculations for maximal doses and 
      volumes of OAR suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after IORT is 
      lower than compared to APBI and EBRT.

AB  - A novel heterobimetallic Cu(II)-Sn(IV) complex 1 bearing bioactive 
      1,10-phenanthroline pharmacophore ligand scaffold was synthesized and 
      characterized by elemental analysis, IR, UV-vis spectroscopy, Mass (ESI and FAB) 
      and X-ray crystallography. The in vitro DNA binding studies of complex 1 with CT 
      DNA was carried out by various biophysical and molecular docking techniques which 
      revealed that complex 1 binds to DNA through intercalation in the minor groove 
      having AT-rich sequences. Complex 1 exhibits high chemical nuclease activity 
      cleaving supercoiled pBR322 DNA via hydrolytic pathway which was further 
      evidenced by T4 DNA ligase assay. The complex 1 shows high inhibitory activity 
      against Topo I at a very low concentration (15 muM), suggesting that complex 1 is 
      an efficient catalytic inhibitor of human Topo I and further validated by 
      molecular docking studies.

TI  - Comparison of pencil beam and collapsed cone algorithms, in radiotherapy 
      treatment planning for 6 and 10 MV photon.
PG  - 152-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: In radiotherapy treatment, the calculation of radiation dose 
      distribution in target volume lead to an optimum set of planning parameters. This 
      worked has been aimed to compare two photon beam dose calculation algorithms in 
      the Oncentra Treatment Planning system for Varian Linear Accelerator, to assure 
      the quality of treatment planning. METHODS: Monitor Units to be delivered on 
      normalization depth in patient has been calculated using the pencil beam and 
      collapsed cone algorithms for two photon energies 6 and 10 MV. The percentage 
      depth dose and beam profiles for 21 treatment fields, for both the calculation 
      systems have been compared for both photon energies. RESULTS: The percentage 
      depth doses and beam profiles for both calculation systems are comparable in 
      large field sizes as well as central axis field settings. The doses normalization 
      depth deviate for some field settings, but in central axis large field sizes the 
      difference within tolerance limits. CONCLUSION: Both calculation algorithms are 
      in close agreement in most of the field settings (mainly in central axis fields), 
      within tolerance level. The difference is relatively greater in small field sizes 
      and off-axis field settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nanotechnology has gained wider importance for the treatment of 
      various diseases, including cancer. Multifunctional or theranostic agents are 
      emerging as promising therapeutic paradigms, which provide attractive vehicles 
      for both image and therapeutic agents. Nanosystems are capable of diagnosis, 
      specific targeted drug therapy and monitoring therapeutic response. Due to their 
      well-developed surface nature, nanomolecules are easy to anchor with 
      multifunctional groups. AREAS COVERED: The present review aims to give an 
      extensive account on the progress of multifunctional nanoparticles throughout the 
      blooming research with regards to their clinical application in cancer. This 
      paper discusses graphene, a newly developed multifunctional vehicle in 
      nanotechnology. Furthermore, it focuses on the development of tumor cells, the 
      advantages of novel multifunctional nanoparticles over traditional methods and 
      the use of nanoparticles in cancer therapy. In addition, patents issued by the US 
      office are also included. EXPERT OPINION: Despite numerous advantages, 
      multifunctional nanoparticles are still at an infancy stage. Many great 
      achievements have been attained in this field to date, but many challenges still 
      remain. A problem that limits the use of multifunctional nanoparticles is 
      toxicity. If this toxicity can be overcome then the advancement in nanocomposite 
      material science will be well on the way to a prospective treatment of cancer.

AB  - To evaluate the biological preference of metallopeptide drugs in cancer cells, a 
      new dinuclear copper(II) complex [Cu(2)(glygly)(2)(ppz)(H(2)O)(4)].2H(2)O (1) 
      (glygly = glycyl glycine anion and ppz = piperazine), was designed and 
      synthesized as topoisomerase I inhibitor. The structural elucidation of the 
      complex was done by elemental analysis, spectroscopic methods and single crystal 
      X-ray diffraction. The in vitro DNA binding studies of complex 1 with CT DNA were 
      carried out by employing different optical methods viz. UV-vis, fluorescence and 
      circular dichroism. The molecular docking technique was also utilized to 
      ascertain the mechanism and mode of action towards the molecular target DNA and 
      enzymes. Complex 1 cleaves pBR322 DNA via an oxidative mechanism and strongly 
      binds to the DNA minor groove. Furthermore, complex 1 exhibits significant 
      inhibitory effects on the catalytic activity of topoisomerase I at a very low 
      concentration, ~12.5 muM, in addition to its excellent SOD mimics (IC(50)~0.086 
      muM).

TI  - Estimation of lipid peroxidation induced by hydrogen peroxide in cultured human 
      lymphocytes.

LID - 10.2203/dose-response.10-002.Siddique [doi]
AB  - Malondialdehyde (MDA) is used for the estimation of damage by reactive oxygen 
      species. MDA is a major reactive aldehyde resulting from the peroxidation of 
      biological membranes. The most common method used to assess MDA production is the 
      thiobarbituric acid (TBARS) assay. However, the value of this method is curbed by 
      low specificity and has been criticized for its use in human studies. In the 
      present study we have used an alternative method for the estimation of MDA 
      production i.e. reaction of MDA with a chromogenic agent 1-methyl-2-phenylindole 
      at 45 degrees C. The paper describes the method of preparing standards for the estimation 
      of MDA (lipid peroxidation) after the treatment with an oxidative stress inducing 
      agent hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)). In the present study, the treatments of 1, 5, 
      10, 20, 50, 100, 150 and 200 muM of H(2)O(2) induced significant increase in lipid 
      peroxidation as compared to the untreated ones. The results suggest that the 
      present method can be used to measure the lipid peroxidation in cultured human 
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and is specific for MDA estimation.

TI  - The dietary supplementation of nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) delayed the loss 
      of climbing ability in Drosophila model of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.3109/19390211.2011.630716 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic 
      neurons and the aggression of alpha Synuclein (alphaS) in the brain. Drosophila 
      mutants and transgenes have provided a platform to understand the mechanistic 
      insight associated with the degenerative diseases. A number of polyphenols have 
      been reported to inhibit the alphaS aggregation resulting in the possible prevention 
      of PD. The involvement of free radicals in mediating the neuronal death in PD has 
      also been implicated. In the present study, the effect of Nordihydroguaiaretic 
      acid (NDGA) was studied on the climbing ability of the PD model Drosophila 
      expressing normal human alpha synuclein (h-alphaS) in the neurons. These flies 
      exhibit locomotor dysfunction as the age progresses. NDGA at final concentration 
      of 0.01, 0.1, 0.5, and 1mul/ml was supplemented with the diet and the flies were 
      allowed to feed for the 24 days. NDGA at 0.01 mul/ml did not showed any 
      significant delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD model flies. However, 
      NDGA doses at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mul/ml showed a dose dependent significant (p < 
      .05) delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD model flies as compared to the 
      untreated PD flies. The results suggest that the NDGA is potent in delaying the 
      climbing disability of PD model flies and also supports the utility of this model 
      in studying PD symptoms.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Viscum album L. is claimed in traditional medical 
      practice, to be useful in the treatment of epilepsy and insomnia in Himachal 
      Pradesh, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of Viscum album L. on epilepsy, 
      psychosis and sedative activity was evaluated in mice and rats using standard 
      procedure. RESULTS: The aqueous leaf extract of Viscum album L. prolonged the 
      pentobarbital induced sleeping time and reduced the locomotor activity in 
      actophotometer. This suggests that reduced locomotor activity facilitate 
      GABAergic transmission. In addition the extract reduced MES, INH and PTZ-induced 
      convulsions which suggest that there may be possibility of blocking Na(+) 
      channels, opening of Cl(-) channels or enhancing the GABAergic system. The 
      extract decreased the apomorphine-induced stereotyped behavior and potentiates 
      the HAL-induced cataleptic score which suggests the extract possess 
      antidopaminergic activity. CONCLUSION: The results obtained in present study 
      suggested that title plant exhibited sedative, antiepileptic and antipsychotic 
      activity in mice and rats.

TI  - Classical to current approach for treatment of psoriasis: a review.
PG  - 287-302
AB  - Psoriasis is a genetic predisposition with T-cell mediated autoimmune 
      inflammatory skin disorder, characterized by cutaneous inflammation, increased 
      epidermal proliferation, hyperkeratosis, angiogenesis, and abnormal 
      keratinization that affects up to 2 - 3% of the population worldwide. Common 
      therapies that are used for the treatment of psoriasis include topical, systemic, 
      phototherapy, combination, herbal therapy and novel molecules. Topically used 
      agents include Vit D, calcipotriol, corticosteroids, dithranol and retinoids etc. 
      Systemically used agents include methotrexate and cyclosporine etc. Phototherapy 
      includes UV-B, Psoralen plus ultraviolet therapy and excimer laser etc. These 
      therapies have a number of potential problems, such as limited in efficacy, 
      inconvenience, organ toxicity, carcinogenic and broadband immunosuppression. In 
      natural treatment a variety of natural agents such as methanolic extracts of 
      duzhong (Eucommia ulmoides Oliv.), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis,) linseed oil, 
      fish oil, and Indigo naturalis etc., that modulates T cell and cytokine action at 
      various steps along with the pathogenic sequence have been developed. But till 
      now there is no more in vivo, dose and its efficacy data has been established. 
      Current therapy includes biologicals, small molecules inhibitor and enzyme 
      inhibitors etc, which serve as novel therapeutic options for psoriasis treatment. 
      All these avoid the side effects of the prebiologically developed systemic agents 
      including hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and bone marrow suppression. Currently, 
      Denilukin diftitox, Efalizumab, Alefacept, Ustekinumab and Etanercept are 
      approved by the FDA, and others molecules are at clinical stage. Patents issued 
      by the US office are also included in current psoriasis treatment scenario. In 
      the United States, biologicals are widely used for moderate-to-severe psoriasis. 
      But because of the high cost of medication and their availability in injection 
      form, it remains to be seen how widely these agents will be utilized worldwide. 
      Still, developing countries prefer conventional drugs.

TI  - Anti-inflammatory and analgesic potential of a novel steroidal derivative from 
      Bryophyllum pinnatum.

AB  - A new steroidal derivative, urs Stigmast-4, 20 (21), 23-trien-3-one and other 
      four compounds were isolated from the leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum. The 
      structure of this new steroid was elucidated and established by standard 
      spectroscopic methods. Carrageenan induced paw edema model was used for 
      anti-inflammatory and acetic acid induced model used for analgesic activity. This 
      new steroidal compound was found to be active in reducing inflammation (% 
      inhibition 87.29 and 84.45 respectively) when compared with diclofenac. Further, 
      it showed 75.72% protection in analgesic activity in acetic acid induced writhing 
      test in mice. In conclusion the % inhibition against carrageenan induced rat paw 
      edema and % protection against acetic acid induced writhings showed by new 
      compound revealed that the anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity of aqueous 
      extract B. pinnatum are mainly due to the presence of this steroidal compound.

TI  - The inoculation method affects colonization and performance of bacterial 
      inoculant strains in the phytoremediation of soil contaminated with diesel oil.
PG  - 35-47
AB  - Plants in combination with microorganisms can remediate soils, which are 
      contaminated with organic pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons. Inoculation 
      of plants with degrading bacteria is one approach to improve remediation 
      processes, but is often not successful due to the competition with resident 
      microorganisms. It is therefore of high importance to address the persistence and 
      colonization behavior of inoculant strains. The objective of this study was to 
      determine whether the inoculation method (seed imbibement and soil inoculation) 
      influences bacterial colonization, plant growth promotion and hydrocarbon 
      degradation. Italian ryegrass was grown in non-sterilized soil polluted with 
      diesel and inoculated with different alkane-degrading strains Pantoea sp. ITSI10, 
      Pantoea sp. BTRH79 and Pseudomonas sp. MixRI75 individually as well as in 
      combination. Inoculation generally had a beneficial effect on plant biomass 
      production and hydrocarbon degradation, however, strains inoculated in soil 
      performed better than applied by seed imbibement. Performance correlated with the 
      colonization efficiency of the inoculated strains. The highest hydrocarbon 
      degradation was observed in the treatment, in which all three strains were 
      inoculated in combination into soil. Our study revealed that besides the 
      degradation potential and competitive ability of inoculant strains the 
      inoculation method plays an important role in determining the success of 
      microbial inoculation.

      tetranuclear Cu(II) complex 1 and dinuclear ternary amino acid complexes 2 and 3 
      L-trp and L-val, respectively were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. In 
      vitro DNA binding studies of complexes 1-3 were carried out employing UV-vis 
      titrations, fluorescence, circular dichroic and viscosity measurements which 
      revealed that the complexes 1-3 bind to CT DNA preferably via groove binding. 
      Complex 1 cleaved pBR322 DNA via hydrolytic pathway (validated by T4 DNA ligase 
      assay), accessible to major groove while 2 followed oxidative mechanism, binding 
      to minor groove of DNA double helix; binding events were further validated by 
      molecular docking studies. Additionally, the complexes 1 and 2 exhibit high 
      Topo-I inhibitory activity at different concentrations. The complexes 1-3 were 
      evaluated for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus 
      aureus, and 2 was found to be most effective against Gram-positive bacteria.

TI  - Response of maternally isolated rock pigeons (Columba livia domestica) to 
      different dietary concentrations of mannan-oligosaccharide.
PG  - 1598-603
LID - 10.3382/ps.2011-02042 [doi]
AB  - Prebiotics are being used as an alternative to antibiotic growth promoters in 
      poultry industry with a variable degree of success. This trial was conducted to 
      investigate the effect of dietary mannan-oligosaccharide (MOS) supplementation on 
      growth performance, selected colonic bacterial population, and immune response in 
      maternally-isolated rock pigeons. The pigeons (n = 36) were randomly distributed 
      in 4 treatment groups (n = 9 per group) with 3 replicates or pens (n = 3) in each 
      group. Birds were fed either a corn/wheat-based basal diet (control group/CON) or 
      the same diet supplemented with 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.5% MOS for 35 d. On d 35, birds 
      were killed to collect visceral organs, colonic contents, and serum. Colonic 
      contents were used to enumerate selected microbiota and serum was used to detect 
      antibody titer against the Newcastle disease virus. Cell-mediated immunity was 
      determined by measuring the skin thickness following 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene 
      challenge. Results showed that supplementation did not affect the BW of birds. 
      During wk 4, feed intake was significantly higher in the 0.2% (187.9 +/- 0.86) and 
      the 0.5% (186.4 +/- 0.86) MOS-supplemented groups compared with the CON group 
      (180.7 +/- 0.86). Gizzard weights (with and without digesta) were significantly 
      higher in the MOS 0.1% (10.67 +/- 0.33 and 8.22 +/- 0.26) and the MOS 0.2% (9.91 +/- 
      0.33 and 7.94 +/- 0.26) groups compared with the CON group (7.56 +/- 0.33 and 6.25 +/- 
      0.26). Small intestinal weight was significantly higher in the MOS 0.2% group 
      (14.71 +/- 0.56) compared with the CON group (9.56 +/- 0.56). Lengths of small 
      intestine (MOS 0.1% = 92.56 +/- 1.69, MOS 0.2% = 90.79 +/- 1.69, MOS 0.5% = 90.57 +/- 
      1.69) in all the MOS-fed groups and large intestine in the 0.1% (3.50 +/- 0.02) and 
      the 0.5% (3.47 +/- 0.02) MOS-fed groups were significantly higher than the CON 
      group (small intestine = 77.63 +/- 1.69, large intestine = 2.41 +/- 0.02). Weights of 
      heart, liver, pancreas, and large intestine remained unaffected. Feeding of MOS 
      did not influence colonic population of Escherichia coli, Clostridia, and 
      Bifidobacteria. Lactobacilli count was significantly higher in the 0.2% MOS-fed 
      group (9.77 +/- 0.12) compared with the CON group (9.19 +/- 0.16). 
      Mannan-oligosaccharide did not affect the immune response of the birds as 
      antibody titer against the New Castle disease virus and the cell-mediated 
      immunity remained similar in all the treatment groups. In conclusion, dietary MOS 
      supplementation influenced only the colonic lactobacilli population without any 
      apparent effects on the production performance in growing pigeons.

      as an important tool to deliver conventional drugs, recombinant proteins, 
      vaccines and more recently, nucleotides. NPs modify the drug release pattern, 
      absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) and therapeutic response. 
      This review focuses on the potential of nanotechnology in cancer and discusses 
      the different nanoparticulate drug-delivery systems including quantum dot, iron 
      oxide nanoparticles, gold nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, silica nanoparticles, 
      dendrimer, graphene and polymeric nanoparticles with their applications in 
      therapeutics, diagnostics, and imaging pattern. Further, the recent development 
      and progress of theranostic nanoparticles in the treatment of cancer and toxicity 
      associated with nanoparticles is also covered here.

AB  - A new water soluble copper(II) complex, [Cu(glygly)(ssz)(H(2)O)]⋅6H(2)O, 1 
      derived from dipeptide (glycyl glycine anion) and sulfasalazine was synthesized 
      and characterized by elemental analysis (CHN), molar conductance measurements and 
      spectroscopic methods (IR, UV-vis, ESI-MS). The complex 1 is non-ionic in nature 
      and possess octahedral geometry around Cu(II) metal ion. The interaction of 
      complex 1 with Human Serum Albumin (HSA) was investigated under physiological 
      condition in Tris-HCl buffer solution at pH 7.4 by means of various spectroscopic 
      methods (fluorescence, CD and FTIR) and molecular docking technique. The results 
      of fluorescence titration revealed that the complex 1 strongly quench the 
      intrinsic fluorescence of HSA through a static quenching procedure. Binding 
      constants (K(b)) and the number of binding sites (n approximately 1) were calculated using 
      modified Stern-Volmer equations. The thermodynamic parameters DeltaG at different 
      temperatures were calculated subsequently the value of DeltaH and DeltaS was also 
      calculated which revealed that the hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions 
      play a major role in HSA-complex 1 association. The distance r between donor 
      (HSA) and acceptor (complex 1) was obtained according to fluorescence resonance 
      energy transfer and the alterations of HSA secondary structure induced by complex 
      1 were confirmed by FT-IR and CD measurements.

AB  - In the present study, the effect of l-ascorbic acid (AA) was studied on the 
      climbing ability of the Parkinson's disease (PD) model Drosophila expressing 
      normal human alpha synuclein (h-alphas) in the neurons. These flies show locomotor 
      dysfunction as the age progresses. AA at final concentration of 11.35 x 10(-5) M, 
      22.71 x 10(-5) M, 45.42 x 10(-5) M, and 68.13 x 10(-5) M was added to the diet, 
      and the flies were allowed to feed for 21 days. AA at 11.35 x 10(-5) M did not 
      show any significant delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD model flies. 
      However, AA at 22.71 x 10(-5) M, 45.42 x 10(-5) M, and 68.13 x 10(-5) M showed a 
      dose dependent significant (p < .05) delay in the loss of climbing ability of PD 
      model flies as compared to the untreated PD flies. The total protein 
      concentration in brain homogenate was measured in treated as well as control 
      groups after 21 days, no significant difference was obtained between treated as 
      well as control (PD flies and l-dopa) groups. The results suggest that AA is 
      potent in delaying the climbing disability of the PD model flies expressing h-alphas 
      in the neurons.

TI  - A novel ZRS mutation in a Balochi tribal family with triphalangeal thumb, 
      pre-axial polydactyly, post-axial polydactyly, and syndactyly.

LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.35473 [doi]
AB  - Limb malformations are one of the most common types of human congenital 
      malformations. Mutations in the ZRS enhancer of Sonic Hedgehog are thought to be 
      responsible for pre-axial polydactyly in multiple independent families. Here, we 
      describe a large Balochi tribal family from Southern Punjab, Pakistan, with a 
      variable set of limb malformations and a novel ZRS mutation. The family has a 
      limb phenotype characterized by triphalangeal thumb, pre-axial polydactyly, and 
      post-axial polydactyly. There is also a high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity 
      with less common clinical findings in the affected family members that include 
      osseous syndactyly of forth-fifth fingers, clinodactyly, hypoplasia of mesoaxial 
      fingers, and bifid halluces. The presentation in most of the affected patients 
      was bilateral and symmetrical. A heterozygous C>A mutation at position 287 of the 
      ZRS enhancer (chr7:156,584,283; hg19) was detected in all affected subjects and 
      is absent from four unaffected family members, 42 unrelated samples, and multiple 
      databases of human variation. Combined, these results identify a novel ZRS287 C>A 
      mutation which leads to a variable spectrum of limb phenotypes.

AB  - The interaction of new dinuclear copper(ii) complex 1; 
      [Cu(2)(glygly)(2)(ppz)(H(2)O)(4)].2H(2)O, derived from dipeptide (glycyl glycine) 
      and piperazine as a metallopeptide drug with human serum albumin (HSA) was 
      examined by means of fluorescence spectroscopy which revealed that complex 1 has 
      a strong ability to quench the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA through a static 
      quenching procedure. The alterations of HSA secondary structure in the presence 
      of complex 1 were confirmed by UV-visible, FT-IR, CD and 3D fluorescence 
      spectroscopy. The binding constants (K), and binding site number (n), 
      corresponding thermodynamic parameters DeltaG, DeltaH and DeltaS at different temperatures 
      were calculated. The molecular docking technique was utilized to ascertain the 
      mechanism and mode of action towards the molecular target HSA indicating that 
      complex 1 was located at the entrance of site I by electrostatic and hydrophobic 
      forces, consistent with the corresponding experimental results. Complex 1 shows 
      efficient photo-induced HSA cleavage activity, indicating the involvement of 
      hydroxyl radicals as the reactive species. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of 1 was 
      examined on a panel of human tumor cell lines of different histological origins 
      showing significant GI(50) values specifically towards MIAPACA2, A498 and A549 
      tumor cell lines. These results complement previous biological studies of new 
      specific target metallopeptides, providing additional information about 
      possibilities of their transport and disposition in blood plasma.

      bearing bioactive pharmacophore ligand scaffold; 1,10-phenanthroline and 
      ethylenediamine were synthesized and characterized by spectroscopic (IR, UV-vis, 
      NMR, ESI-MS) and analytical methods. The in vitro DNA binding studies of 1 and 2 
      with CT-DNA were carried out by employing various biophysical methods which 
      reveal strong electrostatic binding via phosphate backbone of DNA helix, in 
      addition to partial intercalation in the minor groove and stabilized by 
      intramolecular hydrogen bonding. To gain further insight into the molecular 
      recognition at the target site, UV-vis titrations of 1 with 5'-GMP was carried 
      out and validated by (1)H and (31)P NMR. Complex 1 cleaved pBR322 DNA via 
      oxidative pathway and exhibited high inhibition activity against Topo-I at 20 muM. 
      Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of 1 was examined on a panel of human tumor cell 
      lines of different histological origins showing promising antitumor activity.

AB  - The combined use of plants and associated microorganisms has great potential for 
      remediating soil contaminated with organic compounds such as pesticides. The 
      objective of this study was to determine whether the bacterial inoculation 
      influences plant growth promotion and chlorpyrifos (CP) degradation and 
      accumulation in different parts of the plant. Ryegrass was grown in soil spiked 
      with CP and inoculated with a pesticide degrading bacterial strain Bacillus 
      pumilus C2A1. Inoculation generally had a beneficial effect on CP degradation and 
      plant biomass production, highest CP degradation (97%) was observed after 45 days 
      of inoculation. Furthermore, inoculated strain efficiently colonized in the 
      rhizosphere of inoculated plant and enhanced CP and its primary metabolite 
      3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP) degradation. There was significantly less CP 
      accumulation in roots and shoots of inoculated plants as compared to uninoculated 
      plants. The results show the effectiveness of inoculated exogenous bacteria to 
      boost the remediation of CP contaminated sites and decrease levels of toxic 
      pesticide residues in crop plants.

TI  - Curative propensity of green tea extract towards hepatic fibrosis induced by 
      CCl(4): A histopathological study.
PG  - 781-786
AB  - Hepatic fibrosis constitutes a serious insult to the liver, with a substantial 
      negative impact on the quality of life of such patients worldwide. It is a 
      consequence of severe liver damage and occurs as the result of several factors. 
      Chronic alcoholism is the most common cause. Fibrosis also results from chronic 
      viral hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis. Prolonged exposure to environmental 
      toxins such as carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) can also lead to fibrosis. In the 
      present study, the hepato-protective effects of green tea extract (GTE) on 
      hepatic fibrosis in a rat liver CCl(4)-induced fibrosis model were examined 
      histologically, 3-dimensionally and biochemically. GTE was prepared from dried 
      green tea leaves and lyophilized. Male albino rats (n=20) weighing 200-250 g were 
      divided into four groups: GI, control; GII, administered 50 mg/kg GTE dissolved 
      in physiological saline daily for four weeks; GIII, administered 40% CCl(4) (1 
      ml/kg body weight) by subcutaneous injection daily for four weeks; and GIV, 
      treated as GIII, followed by 50 mg/kg GTE dissolved in physiological saline daily 
      for 4 weeks. Histology and 3-dimensional scanning electron microscopy showed 
      hepatic fibrosis with intermingled fibers located between cells in the liver 
      tissues of the CCl(4)-treated rats. Fibrotic lesions virtually disappeared after 
      four weeks of treatment with GTE, returning the architecture of liver tissue back 
      to its normal state. Also, the levels of the hepatic enzymes alanine 
      aminotranferase and aspartate aminotransferase returned to their normal levels 
      after treatment with GTE. The rats were found to regain their normal body weight 
      and their fur color, which had faded due to weight loss. The autopsy results 
      showed the animal liver returning to normal shape and color. Thus, green tea 
      extract is a potent treatment for hepatic fibrosis caused by CCl(4) in this 
      animal model.

      (R)/(S)-2-amino-3-(((1-hydroxypropan-2-yl)imino)methyl)-4H-chromen-4-one (L(1) 
      and L(2)) derived from 2-amino-3-formylchromone and (R/S)-2-amino-1-propanol and 
      their Cu(II)/Zn(II) complexes (R1, S1, R2, and S2) were synthesized. The 
      complexes were characterized by elemental analysis, infrared (IR), hydrogen ((1) 
      H) and carbon ((13)C) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electrospray 
      ionization-mass spectra (ESI-MS), and molar conductance measurements. The DNA 
      binding studies of the complexes with calf thymus were carried out by employing 
      different biophysical methods and molecular docking studies that revealed that 
      complexes R1 and S1 prefers the guanine-cytosine-rich region, whereas R2 and 
      prefers the adenine-thymine residues in the major groove of DNA. The relative 
      trend in K(b) values followed the order R1>S1>R2>S2. This observation together 
      with the findings of circular dichroic and fluorescence studies revealed maximal 
      potential of (R)-enantiomeric form of complexes to bind DNA. Furthermore, the 
      absorption studies with mononucleotides were also monitored to examine the 
      base-specific interactions of the complexes that revealed a higher propensity of 
      Cu(II) complexes for guanosine-5'-monophosphate disodium salt, whereas Zn(II) 
      complexes preferentially bind to thymidine-5'-monophosphate disodium salt. The 
      cleavage activity of R1 and R2 with pBR322 plasmid DNA was examined by gel 
      electrophoresis that revealed that they are good DNA cleavage agents; 
      nevertheless, R1 proved to show better DNA cleavage ability. Topoisomerase II 
      inhibitory activity of complex R1 revealed that the complex inhibits 
      topoisomerase II catalytic activity at a very low concentration (25 muM). 
      Furthermore, in vitro antitumor activity of complexes R1 and S1 were screened 
      against human carcinoma cell lines of different histological origin.

TI  - Presentation, diagnosis and outcome of predominantly hepatic Wilson's disease in 
      adult Saudi patients: a single centre experience.
PG  - 334-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: To evaluate the clinical manifestations, diagnostic features, 
      disease course and response to treatment among Saudi adults with predominantly 
      hepatic Wilson's disease. A retrospective cohort study of 40 adult patients 
      diagnosed with predominantly hepatic Wilson's disease between 1994 and 2008 at 
      King Abdulaziz Medical City, Riyadh was carried out. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 
      diagnosis was based on varying combinations of clinical and laboratory evidence 
      of liver disease, presence of Kayser Fleisher rings, low serum ceruloplasmin 
      levels, elevated 24 hour urinary copper excretion and histopathological findings 
      on liver biopsy. RESULTS: The most frequent clinical presentation was 
      decompensated chronic liver disease in 19 (47.5%), followed by chronic hepatitis 
      in 15 (37.5%) and fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in 5 (12.5%) patients. Eight 
      (20%) patients with end-stage liver disease had liver transplantation, while 24 
      (60%) patients followed up on medical treatment for a variable period of 1-12 
      years showed clinical and laboratory improvement. One patient was lost early in 
      follow up. Eight (20%) patients died during the study period, 5 with FHF, and 2 
      with advanced hepatic and neurological disease and one seven years after liver 
      transplantation. Mortality rate was 100% in FHF without liver transplantation. 
      CONCLUSION: A predominantly hepatic Wilson's disease has varied clinical 
      presentations with decompensated chronic liver disease being the most common 
      among adult patients. Majority of the patients show stabilization of the disease 
      on medical treatment. FHF in Wilson's disease has a grave prognosis without liver 
      transplantation, the later remains a definitive treatment option for 
      decompensated cirrhotics and patients with FHF.

AB  - Plant-bacteria partnerships have been extensively studied and applied to improve 
      crop yield. In addition to their application in agriculture, a promising field to 
      exploit plant-bacteria partnerships is the remediation of soil and water polluted 
      with hydrocarbons. Application of effective plant-bacteria partnerships for the 
      remediation of hydrocarbons depend mainly on the presence and metabolic 
      activities of plant associated rhizo- and endophytic bacteria possessing specific 
      genes required for the degradation of hydrocarbon pollutants. Plants and their 
      associated bacteria interact with each other whereby plant supplies the bacteria 
      with a special carbon source that stimulates the bacteria to degrade organic 
      contaminants in the soil. In return, plant associated-bacteria can support their 
      host plant to overcome contaminated-induced stress responses, and improve plant 
      growth and development. In addition, plants further get benefits from their 
      associated-bacteria possessing hydrocarbon-degradation potential, leading to 
      enhanced hydrocarbon mineralization and lowering of both phytotoxicity and 
      evapotranspiration of volatile hydrocarbons. A better understanding of 
      plant-bacteria partnerships could be exploited to enhance the remediation of 
      hydrocarbon contaminated soils in conjunction with sustainable production of 
      non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production.

AB  - Hydrogen peroxide is one of the reactive oxygen species for cellular injury. It 
      is overproduced during oxidative stress and is known to damage proteins, nucleic 
      acids and cell membranes. The present study was aimed to study the protective 
      effect of ascorbic acid against the toxic doses of hydrogen peroxide using lipid 
      peroxidation and cytokinesis blocked micronucleus assay. Hydrogen peroxide was 
      studied at 50, 100 and 200muM and was found to increase a dose dependent increase 
      in lipid peroxidation and micronuclei frequency. The treatment of 100 and 200muM 
      of hydrogen peroxide separately along with 20, 40 and 80muM of ascorbic acid 
      showed a dose dependent decrease in the lipid peroxidation and micronuclei 
      frequency. The results suggest a protective effect of ascorbic acid against the 
      hydrogen peroxide induced oxidative damage in cultured human peripheral blood 
      lymphocytes.

      and [Zn(phen)(Tz)Cl(2).H(2)O] 2, where phen = 1,10-phenanthroline and Tz = 
      1,2,4-triazole have been synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic 
      and analytical techniques. The structure of complex 1 was also determined by 
      X-ray crystallography. The in vitro DNA binding studies of complexes 1 and 2 with 
      CT DNA were carried out by various biophysical and molecular docking techniques. 
      Both the complexes cleave supercoiled pBR322 DNA via hydrolytic pathway, as 
      validated by T4 DNA ligase assay. Furthermore, both complexes exhibited 
      significant antimicrobial activity. The results revealed that complex 1 has 
      better prospectus to act as cancer chemotherapeutic candidate which warrants 
      further in vitro and in vivo anticancer investigations.

AB  - The aim of present study was to evaluate the effect of aqueous leaf extract of 
      Annona squamosa with Glipizide in a high fat diet and streptozocin-induced type-2 
      diabetes. Nine groups (n = 6) of male Sprague-Dawley rats were used for the 
      study, with. Basal blood glucose, urine volume, and body weights were measured 
      and the rate were kept on a high fat diet. After 15 days, streptozocin in 
      sub-diabetic dose (35 mg/kg) was administered to the animals to induce diabetes. 
      With 1 week of consistent hyperglycemia, treatment was initiated. Aqueous extract 
      of Annona squamosa was administered orally at 350 mg/kg body weight alone and in 
      combination with reduced and reducing dose combinations of Glipizide. Blood 
      glucose, body weight, urine volume were measured every 10th day. The elevated 
      blood-glucose level in diabetic rats was controlled better with combination 
      therapy compared with the synthetic drug alone or the herbal stand-alone drug. 
      All the results were statistically significant (P < 0.001). A combination of 
      Annona squamosa along with Glipizide may be helpful in dose reduction of 
      Glipizide up to 50%, reducing the risk of the onset of insulin therapy.

LID - 10.1017/S1751731112000250 [doi]
AB  - The objective of the study was to assess the post-weaning growth response of 
      Sahiwal calves reared on four different pre-weaning dietary regimens. The four 
      diets were: (a) whole cow's milk, starter ration (SR; CP = 20%, total digestible 
      nutrients (TDN) = 72%) and Berseem hay (H; Egyptian clover; CP = 21%, TDN = 63%); 
      (b) whole cow's milk + H; (c) milk replacer (MR; reconstituted to supplier 
      specification; Sprayfo(R)) + SR + H; and (d) MR + H. The protein and fat 
      percentages of reconstituted MR were 2.22 and 1.84, respectively. Milk or MR were 
      fed at the rate of 10% of the calves' body weight (BW) until 56 days of age, and 
      then withdrawn gradually until weaned completely by 84 days of age. The average 
      initial BW of calves in groups A, B, C and D were 56.3 +/- 1.0, 47.5 +/- 1.0, 40.4 +/- 
      1.0 and 30.3 +/- 1.0 kg, respectively. Initially, there were 12 calves in each 
      group with six of each sex; however, one male calf died from each of groups B and 
      C and were not replaced. During the post-weaning period, 13 to 24 weeks, the 
      calves were fed a single total mixed ration ad libitum based on maize, canola 
      meal, wheat straw and molasses containing 16% CP and 70% TDN. Daily feed intake 
      and weekly BW gains were recorded. The data were analyzed by MIXED model analysis 
      procedures using the statistical program SAS. The intake of calves as percent of 
      their BW, feed conversion ratio and cost per kg of BW gain were not different (P 
      > 0.05) across treatments. The daily gain at 24 weeks of age for the pre-weaning 
      treatments A, B, C and D were 746 +/- 33, 660 +/- 33, 654 +/- 33 and 527 +/- 33 g/day and 
      the final liveweights of calves were 119 +/- 4.2, 102 +/- 4.2, 95 +/- 4.2 and 75 +/- 4.2 
      kg, respectively. Gains were influenced significantly (P < 0.05) by pre-weaning 
      treatments. The calves fed MR and H only during the pre-weaning period were 
      unable to catch up post weaning with calves on other dietary treatments. The 
      calves fed whole milk from birth at the rate of 10% of liveweight together with 
      concentrates had higher weaning weight and superior growth rate post weaning as 
      well. Thus, pre-weaning feeding was important for higher weaning weights and 
      superior growth rates post weaning.

AB  - AIMS: Morus alba is a plant that is well known for its medicinal properties. In 
      Asian countries, it is traditionally used for anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, 
      hypolipidemic and antioxidant applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate 
      the antiulcer and antioxidant activity of a new steroid from M. alba. MAIN 
      METHODS: Column chromatography was employed to isolate different compounds from 
      M. alba. The molecular structures of the compounds were characterized via IR, UV, 
      (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopic methods. A newly isolated compound was 
      tested for antiulcer activity in pylorus-ligation- and ethanol-induced ulcer 
      models and biochemically estimated for SOD, CAT, GR, GPx, GSH and LPO levels. KEY 
      FINDINGS: Five new compounds were isolated; one of these was a new steroid named 
      albosteroid. This new compound exhibits significant (P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.001) 
      antiulcer activity in pylorus-ligation- and ethanol-induced ulcer models. 
      Furthermore, this compound showed significant dose-dependent reversal of 
      ethanol-diminished activity in antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, GPx and 
      GSH, and reduced the ethanol-elevated levels of GR and LPO. SIGNIFICANCE: The 
      present study clearly demonstrates the anti-ulcer and antioxidant potential of 
      compound 1, which was supported by macroscopic and histopathological studies of 
      stomach wall tissues of differently treated groups of rats.

AB  - Vaccination is considered as an important tool to control foot-and-mouth disease 
      (FMD). A good quality vaccine containing relevant serotypes and matching strains 
      is a pre-requisite for vaccination to be effective. The present study 
      investigated the quality of different brands of FMD vaccine available in 
      Pakistan, including three locally produced and two imported products. All the 
      vaccines were found free of bacterial or fungal contamination. No adverse effects 
      were noted in suckling mice and buffalo calves inoculated with the vaccines, 
      showing that the vaccines were sterile and safe. The humoral immune response to 
      the FMD vaccines was determined in buffalo calves for 234 days post-vaccination. 
      Very low humoral immune responses against FMD serotypes O, A and Asia 1 viruses 
      were detected to the locally produced vaccines. The imported vaccines, however, 
      elicited a higher antibody response which persisted for a long period in one of 
      the 2 vaccines. The present study highlights the need of assessing an independent 
      vaccine quality control of finished FMD vaccine products.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gutkha is a cheap and convenient betel quid substitute, which is 
      popular among all age groups. Various studies reveal its carcinogenic nature that 
      leads to oral submucosus fibrosis and increases the chances of oral cancer. The 
      micronucleus (MN) assay in exfoliated mucosal cells is a useful method for 
      observing genetic damage in humans. AIM: To observe the genotoxic effect of 
      gutkha on human buccal epithelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The MN assay was 
      performed to assess the frequency of MN in human buccal epithelial cells. The 
      study comprises 60 individuals of which 30 individuals were gutkha chewers and 
      another 30 were nonusers (control). The MN frequency was scored to estimate the 
      genotoxic damage. RESULTS: In gutkha users, the frequency of MN was highly 
      significant (17.4 +/- 0.944) as compared with nonusers (control) groups (4.53 +/- 
      0.331) (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The MN assay in human buccal epithelial cells is 
      a useful and minimally invasive method for monitoring genetic damage in humans. 
      Asignificantly higher frequency of micronucleated cells are found among gutkha 
      users.

      System.
PG  - 1274-7
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2012.6346170 [doi]
AB  - Interoperability is the among the key functionalities of an intelligent systems. 
      Home Healthcare Monitoring Systems (HHMS) investigates patients activities at 
      home, but lacks critical information exchange with Health Management Information 
      System (HMIS). This information is vital for physicians to take necessary steps 
      for timely and effective healthcare provisioning for patients. Physicians can 
      only monitor and prescribe patients in time, if the data is shared with their 
      HMIS. HMIS can be compliant to different healthcare standards. Therefore, 
      mediation system is required to enable interoperability between HHMS and HMIS 
      such that physicians and patients information can easily be exchanged. We propose 
      Interoperability Mediation System (IMS) that provides interoperability services 
      for exchange of information among HHMS and HMIS. We consider that HMIS are 
      compliant to two heterogeneous EHR standards (HL7 CDA and openEHR). Alzheimer's 
      patient case study is described as a proof of concept. Sensory information 
      gathered at HHMS, is communicated with HMIS compliant to EHR based healthcare 
      standards. Sensors information in XML form is converted by interoperability 
      service to HL7 CDA and openEHR instances and communicated to HMIS afterwards. 
      This allows the physicians registered with HHMS to monitor the patient using 
      their HMIS and provide timely healthcare information.

AB  - Plant-bacteria partnership is a promising approach for remediating soil 
      contaminated with organic pollutants. The colonization and metabolic activity of 
      an inoculated microorganism depend not only on environmental conditions but also 
      on the physiological condition of the applied microorganisms. This study assessed 
      the influence of different inoculum pretreatments on survival, gene abundance and 
      catabolic gene expression of an applied strain (Pantoea sp. strain BTRH79) in the 
      rhizosphere of ryegrass vegetated in diesel contaminated soil. Maximum bacterium 
      survival, gene abundance and expression were observed in the soil inoculated with 
      bacterial cells that had been pregrown on complex medium, and hydrocarbon 
      degradation and genotoxicity reduction were also high in this soil. These 
      findings propose that use of complex media for growing plant inocula may enhance 
      bacterial survival and colonization and subsequently the efficiency of pollutant 
      degradation.

      The treatment of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 microL/mL of K-canrenoate did not induce the 
      activity of hsp70 significantly compared to the control. The treatments of 0.8

      and 1.0 microL/mL is cytotoxic and caused tissue damage in the third instar larvae of 
      transgenic D. melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ) Bg(9).

PG  - 665-78
LID - 10.1517/17425247.2013.771630 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently emphasized conventional chemotherapies for the 
      elimination of lymphatic filariasis (LF) are imperfect due to unfocused targeting 
      of poorly water-soluble antifilarial drugs. The profound location of drug targets 
      (filarial parasites or wolbachia) within the complex anatomy of lymphatic tissues 
      often necessitates prolonged treatment schedules with high doses leading to 
      undesired side effects and poor patient compliance. Therefore, we need to 
      reformulate antifilarial drugs taking the advantages of nanotechnology through a 
      wide range of nanomedical carriers, which improve drug efficacy, increase 
      bioavailability, and diminish toxicity. AREAS COVERED: Connotations of drug 
      delivery systems (DDSs) to target lymphatic filaroids or wolbachia and systemic 
      microfilaria have been discussed. The potentials of liposomes and solid lipid 
      nanoparticles for the treatment of LF are highlighted. Various critical factors, 
      viz optimal size range, surface properties, preferred pH, mechanism of 
      reticuloendothelial avoidance, and control of the release of antifilarial agents 
      for safe elimination of parasites, are enclosed to design a novel DDS for LF. The 
      review of nanotechnological approaches to improve antifilarial chemotherapy will 
      help to resolve existing technological gaps. EXPERT OPINION: Precincts in the 
      antifilarial discovery programs can never be overcome by conventional methods. 
      Nanomedicine encompasses wide-range solution for each single problem (i.e., from 
      poor solubility to nonspecific targeting of antifilarial agents) for the cure of 
      LF at low costs and may reduce the economic burden of LF diseases. Advances in 
      nanotechnology loom will certainly come forward as silver bullets in the near 
      future for quick diagnosis, control, and elimination of this tropically neglected 
      disease.

PG  - 219-20
AB  - Congenital transverse limb anomalies are rare, which affect upper and/or lower 
      limbs and may accompany several syndromic malformations. We present a sporadic 
      male subject with congenital, unilateral transverse arrest of the left hand. The 
      affected arm was observed to be short with reduced zeugopod and truncated palm. 
      Fingers were represented by five bead-like nubbins. Roentgenographic examination 
      revealed short radius and ulna with hypoplastic distal heads, absent 
      carpals/metacarpals, and a hypoplastic bony island in each nubbin. Consanguinity 
      was denied, and the subject had no symptoms in the orofacial, neurological and 
      skeletal systems. Detailed clinical data with literature survey is presented.

TI  - Lipid and fatty acid profile of Geobacillus kaustophilus in response to abiotic 
      stress.
PG  - 117-25
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2012-0601 [doi]
AB  - Geobacillus kaustophilus is an important food-borne, spore-forming, 
      thermotolerant bacterium. It has a good potential for biotransformation of 
      steroid hormones, such as progesterone and testosterone. In this study, we report 
      G. kaustophilus membrane lipid modifications in response to temperature shock, 
      salinity, incubation time, and pH. Total lipids significantly increased in 
      response to increasing temperature, incubation time, and salt concentration. 
      However, the bacterium presented a significant decrease in the accumulation of 
      total lipids in response to pH shock. The ratio of branched-chain fatty 
      acids/straight-chain fatty acids decreased significantly under all stress 
      conditions. With an increase in temperature, incubation time, and salt 
      concentration, the ratio of iso-fatty acids/anteiso-fatty acids increased 
      significantly, while this ratio remained unaffected by changes in the pH of the 
      growth medium. Our results suggest a modification occurs in the bacterial 
      membrane structure in response to temperature, salinity, incubation time, and pH 
      shock. The variable abiotic stress resulted in a multiple increase in 
      odd-numbered-carbon and low-melting-point anteiso-branched-chain fatty acids, 
      helping the membrane keep its integrity, fluidity, and function for growth of the 
      bacteria under abiotic stress conditions.

      Brevibacterium lactofermentum.
PG  - 81-90
LID - 10.1007/s12010-013-0169-3 [doi]
AB  - Detailed kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for lysine production from 
      Brevibacterium lactofermentum are investigated for the first time in this study. 
      Production of the essential amino acid, L-lysine, by B. lactofermentum was 
      assessed in a flask and a continuously stirred tank fermentor (22 L). Maximum 
      lysine production was achieved after 40 h of growth and at 35  degrees C. The effect of 
      different nitrogen sources such as NH(4)NO(3), (NH(4))(2)SO(4), (NH(4))(2)HPO(4), 
      corn steep liquor, NaNO(3), and urea showed that corn steep liquor gave a better 
      lysine yield. Lysine production was increased when dissolved oxygen was 
      maintained at 50 % saturation. The use of dissolved oxygen was critical for high 
      productivity. This indicates that dissolved oxygen greatly affects L-lysine 
      productivity. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters during lysine production from 
      molasses and glucose mixture showed that B. lactofermentum efficiently converted 
      the substrate mixture into cell mass and lysine. Kinetic and thermodynamic 
      parameters were significantly higher compared with other microorganisms which may 
      be due to the high metabolic activity of B. lactofermentum. This study will have 
      a significant impact on future strategies for lysine production at industrial 
      scale.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the hypolipidemic effect of ursolic 
      acid stearoyl glucoside (UASG) in high-fat diet-induced obesity. Two in vivo 
      experiments such as high-fat diet-induced obesity mice model and lipid emulsion 
      tolerance test in normal rats were performed. In vitro inhibition of pancreatic 
      lipase activity was further measured to substantiate the results. In high-fat 
      diet-induced obesity mice model, female Swiss mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD; 
      40% fat) with or without 1 or 2% of UASG or 0.012% orlistat for nine weeks. In 
      lipid emulsion tolerance test male Wister rats were orally administered, lipid 
      emulsion with or without 500 or 1000 mg/kg of UASG and the plasma triglycerides 
      were measured from 0.5 to 5 h. Consumption of HFD containing UASG to mice for 
      nine weeks exhibited significant reduction in lipid parameters, body weight, 
      parametrial adipose tissue weight, liver triglyceride (TG) and different organ 
      weight compared to HFD fed control. Further it was noted the improvement in 
      insulin resistance induced by the HFD alone group. Furthermore, consumption of an 
      HFD containing 1 or 2% of UASG significantly increased the fecal content and 
      fecal triglyceride compared with the HFD group. Pre-treatment with UASG inhibited 
      the elevated plasma triglyceride level after the oral administration of the lipid 
      emulsion to rats. Further, UASG significantly inhibits activity of pancreatic 
      lipase at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml. Data obtained from the results indicated 
      that UASG prevent high-fat diet-induced obesity in mice possibly by inhibiting 
      pancreatic lipase activity.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the leading causes of death in cancer and yet 
      no drug has proven to be a successful candidate for its treatment in advanced 
      stages. Ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside (UASG) is a newly discovered triterpene 
      in Lantana camara and there lies a possibility that it possess 
      anti-hepatocellular carcinoma property. In the present study, we induced 
      hepatocellular carcinoma in Wistar rats by diethylnitrosamine (DENA) and treated 
      it with ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside. The ability to treat hepatocellular 
      carcinoma was measured by comparing biochemical serum markers such as serum 
      alanine aminotransferase, serum aspartate aminotransferase, serum alkaline 
      phosphatase, and the specific marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, alpha 
      fetoprotein. The histological studies of the livers were also performed. The 
      results have shown significant elevated levels of these parameters as compared to 
      normal control and the drug receiving groups have shown significant reduction in 
      these marker levels. Histopathological studies also indicated the reduced liver 
      damage in drug-treated groups. It was noted that a significant and dose-dependent 
      reversal of DENA-diminished activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide 
      dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione transferase, and the 
      reduced DENA-elevated level of lipid peroxidation (LPO) with a marked change. 
      UASG significantly suppressed free radical formation by scavenging the hydroxyl 
      radicals. It also modulates the levels of LPO and markedly increases the 
      endogenous antioxidant enzymes level in DENA-induced hepatocellular 
      carcinogenesis.

AB  - The present study was designed to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of newly 
      isolated stigmast-4, 20 (21), 23-trien-3-one (STO) against carbon 
      tetrachloride-induced hepatic injury in Wistar albino rats. Hepatotoxicity was 
      induced by the administration of a single intraperitoneal dose of CCl4 (0.5 mL/kg 
      CCl4 in olive oil) in experimental rats. Three different doses (2.5, 5.0, and 10 
      mg/kg, p.o) of STO was administered to the test groups during whole experimental 
      protocol. Changes in the activity of serum ALT, AST, ALP, TB, and TP, 
      anti-oxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and LPO were studied in 
      CCl4-induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis. The altered levels of serum ALT, AST, 
      ALP, TB, and TP restored toward normalization significantly by STO in a dose 
      dependant manner. The biochemical observations were supplemented with 
      histopathological examination of rat liver sections. Meanwhile, it also produced 
      a significant and dose-dependent reversal of CCl4-diminished activity of 
      anti-oxidant enzymes like SOD, CAT, GPx, GST, and the reduced CCl4-elevated level 
      of LPO. STO significantly prevented the increased levels of serum markers, also 
      suppressed the free radical processes by scavenging hydroxyl radicals. It also 
      modulates the levels of LPO and markedly increases the endogenous anti-oxidant 
      enzymes level in CCl4-induced hepatic injury.

TI  - Prevalence of Red-Green Color Vision Defects among Muslim Males and Females of 
      Manipur, India.
PG  - 16-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Color blindness is a common X-linked genetic disorder. However, most 
      of color blinds remain undetected due to absence of proper screening. Our study 
      was to determine the prevalence of red-green color vision defects among Manipuri 
      Muslim males and females. The study could help in decreasing birth of children 
      with this disorder as Muslims commonly perform consanguineous marriage among 
      themselves. METHODS: Unrelated individuals of both sexes (Male-1352, Female-1302) 
      belonging to six different populations were randomly selected and screened for 
      red-green color vision defects using the Ishihara (pseudo-isochromatic plates) 
      test from the area of Imphal East and Imphal west districts of Manipur, which is 
      a small hilly state, situated in the north eastern extreme corner of India 
      sharing an international boundary with Myanmar (Burma). RESULTS: About 8.73% of 
      males and 1.69% of females were found to be color blind. Among six different 
      populations studied the males of Meitei population shows the highest frequency 
      i.e. 14.93% while Naga population shows the least frequency of 3.75%. Among 
      females, Meitei population again shows the highest frequency of 2.5% and least 
      frequency is shown by Mughal and Naga populations 0.00% as not a single female 
      color blind was found. CONCLUSION: Present study shows higher prevalence rate of 
      color blindness as compared to other reported rates of India. Deuteranomaly cases 
      occur in higher percentage than other types of color blindness. The higher 
      prevalence rate observed in Muslims may be due to the hidden effect of 
      consanguineous marriages.

TI  - Comparison of protective and curative potential of Daucus carota root extract on 
      renal ischemia reperfusion injury in rats.
PG  - 856-62
LID - 10.3109/13880209.2013.767840 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Daucus carota Linn (Apiaceae), a useful vegetable, is traditionally used 
      in treating kidney and hepatic dysfunctions. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the 
      protective and curative potential of D. carota root extract on renal ischemia 
      reperfusion injury in rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were selected with 
      8 + 8 groups (n = 6). Renal pedicles of rats were occluded for 45 min and allowed 
      for reperfusion period. In protective and curative studies, 14 days prior and 14 
      days after the induction of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R), rats received petroleum 
      ether extract (PEE 250 and 500 mg/kg), fractional methanol extract (FME 250 and 
      500 mg/kg) and direct methanol extract (DME 250 and 500 mg/kg) of Daucus carota 
      root, orally, once daily. RESULTS: PEE at a dose of 500 mg/kg significantly (p < 
      0.001) reduced the levels of serum creatinine (0.853-3.090 mg/dl), uric acid 
      (1.300-3.500 mg/dl) and urea (58.26-132.00 mg/dl) compared to disease control. 
      FME at a dose of 500 mg/kg body weight significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the 
      levels of serum creatinine (0.960-3.090 mg/dl), uric acid (1.700-3.500 mg/dl) and 
      urea (77.17-132.00 mg/dl) compared to disease control. DME at a dose of 500 mg/kg 
      body weight significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the levels of serum creatinine 
      (1.173-3.090 mg/dl), uric acid (2.267-3.500 mg/dl) and urea (84.75-132.00 mg/dl) 
      compared to disease control. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that 
      postconditioning with the D. carota root extract significantly improves kidney 
      function in I/R rats.

      activity.
PG  - 10029-41

AB  - New molecular topologies quercetin-Cu(II)-Sn2(IV) and Zn(II)-Sn2(IV)1 and 2 were 
      designed and synthesized to act as potential cancer chemotherapeutic agents. 
      Their interaction with CT DNA by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy was 
      evaluated revealing an electrostatic mode of binding. Quercetin complexes are 
      capable of promoting DNA cleavage involving both single and double strand breaks. 
      Complex 1 cleaved pBR322 DNA via an oxidative mechanism while 2 followed a 
      hydrolytic pathway, accessible to the minor groove of the DNA double helix in 
      accordance with molecular docking studies with the DNA duplex of sequence 
      d(CGCGAATTCGCG)2 dodecamer demonstrating that the complex was stabilized by 
      additional electrostatic and hydrogen bonding interactions with the DNA. ROS such 
      as OH , H2O2 and O2 (-) are the major metabolites responsible for chronic 
      diseases such as cancer, respiratory disorders, HIV, and diabetes etc., therefore 
      eliminating ROS by molecular scaffolds involving SOD enzymatic activity has 
      emerged as a potential way to develop a novel class of drugs. Therefore, in vitro 
      superoxide dismutase activity of redox active complex 1 was evaluated by using a 
      xanthine/xanthine oxidase-NBT assay which showed an IC50 value of 2.26 muM. 
      Moreover, the cytotoxicity of both the complexes were screened on a panel of 
      human carcinoma cell lines (GI50 values <8.7 muM) which revealed that 1 has a 
      better prospect of acting as a cancer chemotherapeutic agent, and to elucidate 
      the mechanism of tumor inhibition, Topo-I enzymatic activity was carried out. 
      Furthermore, molecular modeling studies were carried out to understand molecular 
      features important for drug-enzyme interactions which offer new insights into the 
      experimental model observations.

PG  - 1110-24
LID - 10.3109/13880209.2013.781194 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: For its variety of biological activities, Tamarix aucheriana (Decne.) 
      Baum. (Tamaricaceae) has an extensive history as a traditional Arab medicine. 
      OBJECTIVES: Antimitogenic and chemo-sensitizing activities of syringic acid (SA) 
      were studied against human colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Chromatographic and spectral data were used for the isolation and identification 
      of SA. MTT, flow cytometry, in vitro invasion and angiogenesis assays, 
      fluoremetry, ELISA and Real Time qPCR were used to test antimitogenic and 
      chemo-sensitizing activities of SA, cell cycle, apoptosis, proteasome and 
      NFkappaB-DNA-binding activities, cancer cell invasion and angiogenesis, and 
      expression of cell cycle/apoptosis-related genes. RESULTS: SA showed a time- and 
      dose-dependent (IC(5)(0) = 0.95-1.2 mg mL(-)(1)) antimitogenic effect against cancer 
      cells with little cytotoxicity on normal fibroblasts (</=20%). SA-altered cell 
      cycle (S/G2-M or G1/G2-M phases) in a time-dependent manner, induced apoptosis, 
      inhibited DNA-binding activity of NFkappaB (p </= 0.0001), chymotrypsin-like/PGPH 
      (peptidyl-glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing) (p </= 0.0001) and the trypsin-like 
      (p </= 0.002) activities of 26S proteasome and angiogenesis. SA also differentially 
      sensitized cancer cells to standard chemotherapies with a marked increase in 
      their sensitivity to camptothecin (500-fold), 5FU (20,000-fold), doxorubicin 
      (210-fold), taxol (3134-fold), vinblastine (1000-fold), vincristine (130-fold) 
      and amsacrine (107-fold) compared to standard drugs alone. DISCUSSION: SA exerted 
      its chemotherapeutic and chemo-sensitizing effects through an array of mechanisms 
      including cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis induction, inhibition of cell 
      proliferation, cell migration, angiogenesis, NFkappaB DNA-binding and proteasome 
      activities. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the potential of SA as an 
      antimitogenic and chemo-sensitizing agent for human colorectal cancer.

TI  - Accuracy requirements in radiotherapy treatment planning.
PG  - 418-23
AB  - Radiation therapy attempts to deliver ionizing radiation to the tumour and can 
      improve the survival chances and/or quality of life of patients. There are 
      chances of errors and uncertainties in the entire process of radiotherapy that 
      may affect the accuracy and precision of treatment management and decrease degree 
      of conformation. All expected inaccuracies, like radiation dose determination, 
      volume calculation, complete evaluation of the full extent of the tumour, 
      biological behaviour of specific tumour types, organ motion during radiotherapy, 
      imaging, biological/molecular uncertainties, sub-clinical diseases, microscopic 
      spread of the disease, uncertainty in normal tissue responses and radiation 
      morbidity need sound appreciation. Conformity can be increased by reduction of 
      such inaccuracies. With the yearly increase in computing speed and advancement in 
      other technologies the future will provide the opportunity to optimize a greater 
      number of variables and reduce the errors in the treatment planning process. In 
      multi-disciplined task of radiotherapy, efforts are needed to overcome the errors 
      and uncertainty, not only by the physicists but also by radiologists, 
      pathologists and oncologists to reduce molecular and biological uncertainties. 
      The radiation therapy physics is advancing towards an optimal goal that is 
      definitely to improve accuracy where necessary and to reduce uncertainty where 
      possible.

TI  - Clinical and descriptive genetic study of polydactyly: a Pakistani experience of 
      313 cases.
PG  - 482-6
LID - 10.1111/cge.12217 [doi]
AB  - Polydactyly, a common hereditary condition with additional digits in hands and/or 
      feet, is a very attractive model to appreciate clinical and genetic 
      heterogeneity. In order to get an insight into its phenotypic manifestations, we 
      ascertained a cohort of 313 independent families with polydactyly from Pakistan; 
      35% cases turned out to be familial while 65% were sporadic. In majority of the 
      index cases, polydactyly was presented as an isolated digit defect. Preaxial 
      polydactyly types were 48.24% and postaxial were 51.8%. Familial polydactylies 
      mainly had bilateral and symmetrical presentations, whereas sporadic cases were 
      mostly unilateral and less often symmetrical. In the 313 index subjects a total 
      of 508 limbs with additional digits were recorded. Variable expression was 
      evident as the involvement of upper limbs was more common than the lower, right 
      hand than the left, and left foot than the right. The present cohort establishes 
      interesting epidemiological attributes of polydactyly in the Pakistani population 
      and highlights its extraordinary clinical heterogeneity. Molecular analyses of 
      this cohort are anticipated to elucidate novel genetic factors involved in the 
      origin of additional digits in the growing limb and may provide clues to the role 
      of stochastic factors in the etiology of phenotypic variability in polydactyly.

TI  - Validation of 1-methyl-2-phenylindole method for estimating lipid peroxidation in 
      the third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ)Bg 
      (9.).
PG  - 94-7
LID - 10.4103/2229-4708.103883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A method using 1-methyl-2-phenylindole was developed for the 
      estimation of lipid peroxidation in third instar larvae of transgenic Drosophila 
      melanogaster (hsp70-lacZ)Bg (9). The method is specific for the estimation of 
      malonaldehyde. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The larvae were exposed to 0.0025, 0.025, 
      0.050, and 0.100 mul/ml of cyclophosphamide for 24 and 48 h. The homogenate was 
      prepared of the larvae tissue explant and the absorbance was noted at 586 nm. 
      RESULTS: A significant dose-dependent increase in the mean absorbance values was 
      observed for both 24 and 48 h of exposure as compared to the untreated group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of results obtained, it is suggested that the present 
      method is more precise, accurate, and robust for the estimation of lipid 
      peroxidation in the third instar larvae of transgenic D. melanogaster 
      (hsp70-lacZ)Bg (9).

TI  - Ectopic pregnancy: a review.
PG  - 747-57
LID - 10.1007/s00404-013-2929-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ectopic pregnancy (EP) presents a major health problem for women of 
      child-bearing age. EP refers to the pregnancy occurring outside the uterine 
      cavity that constitutes 1.2-1.4 % of all reported pregnancies. All identified 
      risk factors are maternal: pelvic inflammatory disease, Chlamydia trachomatis 
      infection, smoking, tubal surgery, induced conception cycle, and endometriosis. 
      These developments have provided the atmosphere for trials using methotrexate as 
      a non-surgical treatment for EP. The diagnosis measure of EP is serum human 
      chorionic gonadotropin, urinary hCGRP/i-hCG, progesterone measurement, 
      transvaginal ultrasound scan, computed tomography, vascular endothelial growth 
      factor, CK, disintegrin and metalloprotease-12 and hysterosalpingography. The 
      treatment option of EP involves surgical treatment by laparotomy or laparoscopy, 
      medical treatment is usually systemic or through local route, or by expectant 
      treatment. RESULTS: It was concluded that review data reflect a decrease in 
      surgical treatment and not an actual decline in EP occurrence so that further new 
      avenues are needed to explore early detection of the EP.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious causes of death due to single 
      infectious agent after HIV/AIDS. Rifampicin (RIF), Isoniazid (INH), Ethambutol 
      (EMB), Pyrazinamide (PZA) and/or their combinations are extensively prescribed to 
      treat TB. Despite several therapeutic implications, these drugs also produce 
      several toxic effects at cellular level. MTT assay and Ames test were adopted in 
      this study for the determination of cytotoxic and mutagenic potential of these 
      anti-TB drugs. Among all tested drugs, cytotoxic potential of RIF was strongest 
      with highly significant decline (p<0.001) in cell numbers at the concentration of 
      250mug/ml with LC50 at 325mug/ml, while significant decline (p<0.01) in cell count 
      was observed in INH treated group at the concentration 500mug/ml with LC50 at 
      1000mug/ml. Moreover, combination RIPE demonstrated significant reduction (p<0.01) 
      in cell number at the concentration of 25-500-500-500mug/ml with LC50 at 
      60-1200-1200-1200mug/ml. It is apparent from the data that almost all drugs 
      represented identical mutagenic pattern i.e., more significant results were 
      achieved in TA100 with metabolic activation (+S9). RIF proved to be highly 
      mutagenic of all tested drugs with significant mutagenicity (p<0.01) at 
      0.0525mug/plate against TA98 strain with S9. The combination RIPE exhibited highly 
      significant mutagenic activity (p<0.01) at concentration 0.125-3-3-3mug/plate 
      without S9, while addition of S9 resulted in similar activity at lower doses, 
      i.e., 0.0525-1-1-1mug/plate. It was concluded from the data that all anti-TB drugs 
      possess significant cytotoxic and mutagenic potential, especially in combination, 
      making TB patient more vulnerable to cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of anti-TB 
      drugs, which could produce further health complications in TB patients.

TI  - Improved antifilarial activity of ivermectin in chitosan-alginate nanoparticles 
      against human lymphatic filarial parasite, Brugia malayi.
PG  - 2933-43
LID - 10.1007/s00436-013-3466-4 [doi]
AB  - The current antifilarial treatments are not up to the mark partly due to deep 
      location of filarial parasites in the human lymphatic system. We report here on 
      the improvement in the antifilarial activity of ivermectin (IVM) using 
      chitosan-alginate nanoparticles prepared by modified complex coacervation method. 
      The nanoparticles were spherical having 155 nm size and 4.56 and 75.67% loading 
      and entrapment efficiency respectively for IVM. The delivery system maintained 
      the sustained release and significantly augmented the microfilaricidal (MIF) 
      activity at a single low dose (200 mug/kg body weight, subcutaneously) in contrast 
      to much higher dose of free ivermectin (400 mug/kg body weight, subcutaneously) 
      against human lymphatic filariid, Brugia malayi in rodent host, Mastomys coucha. 
      To substantiate increase in MIF activity, pharmacokinetics study was designed on 
      Wistar rats which revealed a greater peak plasma concentration (45.3 +/- 1.79 
      ng/ml), area under the concentration curve (298 +/- 38.7 ng d/ml) and extended mean 
      residence time (23.4 +/- 8.56 days)of IVM in chitosan-alginate nanoparticles. 
      Administration of 25 mg/kg of diethylcarbamazine following nanoparticle therapy 
      significantly improved the MIF and macrofilaricidal action of encapsulated drug 
      and was considered superior in this study.

TI  - Patient satisfaction for levonorgestrel intrauterine system and norethisterone 
      for treatment of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
PG  - 23-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a common problem with complex 
      management. It can be quite harrowing for the physicians as in most instances 
      they are unable to pinpoint the cause of abnormal bleeding even after a thorough 
      history and physical examination. Aim was to compare patient satisfaction for 
      Levonorgestrel intra uterine system (LNG-IUS) and Norethisterone for the 
      treatment of Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding (DUB). It is Descriptive case series 
      conducted in Department Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Shifa International Hospital, 
      Islamabad from September, 2011 to September, 2012. METHODS: One hundred and 
      nineteen (119) female patients of reproductive age Group with DUB were selected 
      by consecutive sampling. Informed written consent was obtained. A structural 
      patient satisfaction questionnaire (PSQ) was used to collect information 
      regarding age of patients, type of method used for treatment of DUB 
      (Levonorgestrel or Norethisterone), treatment outcome in terms of patient 
      satisfaction scale, and decrease in bleeding after 6 months. RESULTS: The mean 
      age of the patients was 41.03 +/- 4.415 year ranging from 28-60 years. The mean 
      parity of women in the study was 3.22 +/- 1.188 with a range of 1-7. The 
      satisfaction level was significantly (p < 0.05) greater (90% versus 20%) in Group 
      A (levonorgesterol-releasing intrauterine system) as compared with Group B 
      (Norethisterone). The blood loss was significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in Group 
      A (98%) as compared with Group B (80%). The preference of continuing the method 
      as well as recommendation to a friend was significantly greater in Group A as 
      compared to Group B. CONCLUSION: The levonorgesterol-releasing intrauterine 
      system (LNG-IUS) is a better choice as compared to Norethisterone, for treatment 
      of DUB with 90% patients highly satisfied.

TI  - Anticonvulsant activity of ethanol extracts of Vetiveria zizanioides roots in 
      experimental mice.
PG  - 1521-4
LID - 10.3109/13880209.2013.799710 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Vetiveria zizanioides Linn. (Gramineae), an aromatic plant commonly 
      known as vetiver, is traditionally used for various ailments. Ethanol and aqueous 
      extract of this plant found extensive use in Indian folklore medicine and used in 
      treatment of a wide range of disorders including seizure. However, the 
      anticonvulsant activity of this plant has not been studied. OBJECTIVE: To 
      evaluate anticonvulsant activity of ethanol extract of V. zizanioides (EEVZ) in 
      experimental mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anticonvulsant activity of EEVZ was 
      determined by maximal electroshock stimulation (MES) and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) 
      in mice for 8 d experimental protocol. The extract at a dose of 100, 200 and 
      400 mg/kg body weight was administered once by oral route. RESULTS: LD50 value of 
      EEVZ in mice was found at a dose of 600 mg/kg body weight. EEVZ at a dose of 
      400 mg/kg significantly (p < 0.001) reduced flexion (l5.98 to 3.73 s), extension 
      (13.73 to 0.96 s), clonus (14.07 to 4.93 s), stupor (6.29 to 1.22 s) in the MES 
      model. Further, it increases onset of clonic (88.25 to 708.32 s/30 min) and tonic 
      (139.52 to 1126.39 s/30 min) in the PTZ model. In the PTZ model, 33% normal 
      control and 83% EEVZ (100 mg/kg) animals were alive, while 100% protection was 
      achieved in standard drug phenobarbital (20 mg/kg), EEVZ (200 mg/kg) and EEVZ 
      (400 mg/kg) animals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Findings demonstrate that V. 
      zizanioides shows significant anticonvulsant activity in mice.

TI  - Personalized-detailed clinical model for data interoperability among clinical 
      standards.
PG  - 632-42
LID - 10.1089/tmj.2012.0189 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data interoperability among health information exchange (HIE) systems 
      is a major concern for healthcare practitioners to enable provisioning of 
      telemedicine-related services. Heterogeneity exists in these systems not only at 
      the data level but also among different heterogeneous healthcare standards with 
      which these are compliant. The relationship between healthcare organization data 
      and different heterogeneous standards is necessary to achieve the goal of data 
      level interoperability. We propose a personalized-detailed clinical model (P-DCM) 
      approach for the generation of customized mappings that creates the necessary 
      linkage between organization-conformed healthcare standards concepts and clinical 
      model concepts to ensure data interoperability among HIE systems. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: We consider electronic health record (EHR) standards, openEHR, and HL7 
      CDA instances transformation using P-DCM. P-DCM concepts associated with openEHR 
      and HL7 CDA help in transformation of instances among these standards. We 
      investigated two datasets: (1) data of 100 diabetic patients, including 50 each 
      of type 1 and type 2, from a local hospital in Korea and (2) data of a single 
      Alzheimer's disease patient. P-DCMs were created for both scenarios, which 
      provided the basis for deriving instances for HL7 CDA and openEHR standards. 
      RESULTS: For proof of concept, we present case studies of encounter information 
      for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and monitoring of daily routine activities 
      of an Alzheimer's disease patient. These reflect P-DCM-based customized mappings 
      generation with openEHR and HL7 CDA standards. Customized mappings are generated 
      based on the relationship of P-DCM concepts with CDA and openEHR concepts. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The objective of this work is to achieve semantic data 
      interoperability among heterogeneous standards. This would lead to effective 
      utilization of resources and allow timely information exchange among healthcare 
      systems.

AB  - Effect of Metformin in chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis was assessed in 
      Wistar rats. Intraperitoneal administration of chemical carcinogen diethyl 
      nitrosamine (DENA) (200 mg/kg) in single dose elevated the levels of serum 
      glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase 
      (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) 
      and reduced high density lipoproteins (HDL), total proteins (TPR) and blood 
      glucose level in tested animals. Histopathological examinations of the liver 
      tissue showed marked carcinogenicity of the chemical carcinogen. Food and water 
      intake, animal weights and serum albumin (ALB) were also assessed. The animals 
      exposed to DENA showed a significant decrease in the body weights and, there were 
      no significant alterations found in the total bilirubin (TBR) levels and 
      gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGTP), whereas the decreased levels of serum ALB 
      were maintained by Metformin treatment. The elevated levels of serum SGOT, SGPT, 
      ALP, AFP, TC and TG were restored by administration of Metformin in reduced dose 
      (125 mg/kg) daily for 16 weeks p.o. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed 
      the beneficial effects of Metformin in the animals exposed to DENA.

AB  - PstS1, also named 38-kDa antigen, is one of the earliest known immune-dominant 
      antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and it has been commonly used in 
      serodiagnostic tests. We constructed a truncated version, tnPstS1, by removing 96 
      and 14 amino acid residues from the N- and C-terminals, respectively of the 
      native PstS1. The native and the truncated 29.5 kDa proteins were expressed in 
      insoluble forms in Escherichia coli to levels of 15% and 25% of the total cell 
      proteins, respectively. Both the variant molecules reacted equally well with the 
      antisera raised in rabbit against the native protein. PstS1 and tnPstS1 were 
      evaluated through ELISA against plasma samples from 160 culture positive 
      tuberculosis patients and 40 healthy controls. With tnPstS1 43% of the patient 
      samples were detected positive for the antibody as compared to only 36% in the 
      case of the native PstS1. Data for the secondary structures of the native and the 
      truncated variants as obtained by circular dichroism agreed with the known 3-D 
      structure of the native protein and the predicted structure of the truncated 
      version, respectively. The results show that the truncated tnPstS1 is more 
      efficient as compared to the native PstS1 for use as a serodiagnostic agent.

TI  - Perceptive solutions to anti-filarial chemotherapy of lymphatic filariasis from 
      the plethora of nanomedical sciences.
PG  - 1-13
LID - 10.3109/1061186X.2013.832766 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Growing interest in the application of nanotechnology to treat 
      lymphatic filariasis (LF) implies that the imminent medical arsenal of this 
      interesting technology is attractive for health authorities. Currently, they are 
      completely dependent on friendly oral mass drug (anti-filarials) administration 
      to eliminate this morbid disease and are now looking for new alternatives to 
      bring about further improvements. AREAS COVERED: A plethora of issues affecting 
      the oral bioavailability of the mainstay human lymphatic filarial drugs, leading 
      to meager pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics issues in anti-filarial 
      chemotherapy are identified. Various important nanomedical drug delivery systems 
      are highlighted and their solutions provided. A conceptual resolution to strictly 
      arrest the transmission of LF in endemic areas is also presented. FUTURE 
      PERSPECTIVES: Unless the solutions for pharmacokinetic tribulations and the 
      measurement of factual pharmacodynamic endpoints for the existing anti-filarial 
      drugs are evaluated using relevant approaches, health authorities will not be 
      able to devise optimal treatment regimens for affected patients. Contemporary 
      therapeutic paradigms need to be shifted toward the upcoming schemes of 
      nanopharmaceutical sciences, which have enormous potential to advance the 
      community-directed management of this tropical disease by improving the 
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the filaricidal agents.

TI  - Combination of sulfamethoxazole and selenium in anticancer therapy: a novel 
      approach.
PG  - 279-85
LID - 10.1007/s11010-013-1811-7 [doi]
AB  - Sulfonamides have been reported to possess substantial antitumor activity as they 
      act as carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. In addition, selenium appears to have a 
      protective effect at various stages of cancer due to its antioxidant property, 
      enhanced carcinogen detoxification, inhibition of cell invasion, and by 
      inhibiting angiogenesis. Here, in the present study we aimed to evaluate and 
      synergize the cytotoxic activity of sulfonamide and selenium (SM+SE) as effective 
      therapy in the treatment of DENA-induced HCC. Hepatocarcinogeneis was induced by 
      a single intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (DENA) (200 mg/kg) in 
      phosphate buffer. 30 Male Wistar rats used in this study were divided randomly 
      into five equal groups (n = 6). DENA-administered animals showed significant 
      alteration (p < 0.001) in liver-specific enzymes-glutamate oxaloacetate 
      transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), alkaline 
      phosphatase (ALP), and Alpha fetoproteins (AFP), and also induced severe 
      histopathological changes in the hepatic tissues. Interestingly, treatment with 
      (SE+SE) (SM 30 mg/kg + SE 3 mg/kg) significantly reduced (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, 
      P < 0.001, P < 0.001) the elevated AFP, SGOT, SGPT, and ALP levels, respectively, 
      suggesting that combination therapy of SM+SE has a potential to treat 
      DENA-induced liver damage.

TI  - Therapeutic exploration of betulinic acid in chemically induced hypothyroidism.
PG  - 27-34
LID - 10.1007/s11010-013-1842-0 [doi]
AB  - Hypothyroidism is a chronic condition characterized by abnormally low thyroid 
      hormone production. The decreased serum level (>5.1 mIU/l) of thyroid-stimulating 
      hormone (TSH) in blood indicates hypothyroidism. The study was an attempt to 
      access the effect of betulinic acid on chemically induced hypothyroidism in 
      female albino rats. Betulinic acid is a naturally occurring pentacyclic 
      triterpenoid, which has antiretroviral, antimalarial, and anti-inflammatory 
      properties, as well as anticancer potential, by inhibiting topoisomerase. 
      Hypothyroidism was induced in female albino rats using propylthiouracil (PTU) at 
      a dose of 60 mug/kg body weight orally for 1 month. Induction of hypothyroidism 
      was confirmed by increased TSH level. At the end of second month, blood was 
      collected, centrifuged and serum was analyzed for TSH, T3, and T4 level and 
      protocol was terminated by killing of animals. The animals exposed to PTU were 
      treated with pure standard drug thyroxine at a dose of 10 mug/kg of body weight by 
      oral route and the test drug betulinic acid 20 mg/kg by oral route through force 
      feeding in their respective groups. Treatment was carried out for a period of 
      2 months. Group with PTU-induced hypothyroidism showed an elevation in serum TSH 
      and reduction level, which was restored by the betulinic acid in treated female 
      albino rats. Betulinic acid also reduced the damage caused in the thyroid tissues 
      by PTU, thus minimizing the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Histopathological 
      examinations of the thyroid tissue showed changes in the thyrocytes of 
      PTU-treated group while thyroxine group showed normal thyroid follicles cell 
      architecture and the group treated with betulinic acid also showed marked 
      improvement in the follicles integrity which shows that betulinic acid has some 
      protective activity. This study shows that the betulinic acid has 
      thyroid-enhancing potential by lowering down the TSH levels and reducing the 
      damage caused in the thyroid tissues, thus minimizing the symptoms of 
      hypothyroidism when used anaphylactically in rats.

TI  - Authoring tool: acquiring sharable knowledge for Smart CDSS.
PG  - 1278-81
LID - 10.1109/EMBC.2013.6609741 [doi]
AB  - Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) assist clinicians in making clinical 
      decisions by using experts' knowledge stored in the knowledge base. However, 
      sharing and reusing the knowledge is a challenging task. Many systems are 
      developed to facilitate sharing of medical knowledge and allow its reusability. 
      These systems are compliant to standard approaches such as HL7 Arden Syntax and 
      HL7 CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) to incorporate medical logic in standard 
      format. The main drawback with these systems is the complicated procedure in the 
      development of clinical knowledge by ordinary clinicians. The proposed research 
      work is focusing on developing authoring tool that creates sharable clinical 
      knowledge base using standards such as HL7 Arden Syntax, HL7 vMR and HL7 CDA. 
      Moreover, the authoring tool provides user friendly GUI to facilitate clinicians 
      in creating standard based executable clinical knowledge base. We are closely 
      working with oncologists and clinicians of a prominent cancer hospital to deploy 
      the tool for Head and Neck Cancer diagnosis and treatment recommendations.

TI  - Lipid profile of women using oral contraceptive pills.
PG  - 947-50
AB  - Oral contraceptives (OCs) are the most popular type of birth control pills. The 
      study was designed to examine the biochemical changes which occur due to the use 
      of oral contraceptive pills (OCs). The study was based on the questionnaire for 
      having the information of any reproductive history fasting, age, health, nature 
      of menstrual cycle, bleeding, disease etc and blood profiling for biochemical 
      analysis of the women includes high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low 
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides 
      (TG). Lipid profiling was carried out by using a commercially available 
      diagnostic test kits. SPSS was used to analyze the data. The results showed 
      statistically significant differences among users of OCs compared to non-users. 
      Total cholesterol (242.92 +/- 2.842 mg dL(-1)), HDL-C (58.65 +/- 1.098 mg 
      dL(-1)), LDL-C (115.84 +/- 1.266 mg dL(-1)) and triglycerides (105.56 +/- 2.341 
      mg dL(-1)) were significantly higher compared to the non-users (Total cholesterol 
      218.49 +/- 1.762, HDL-C 48.17 +/- 0.543, LDL-C 100.321 +/- 0.951 and 
      triglycerides 83.77 +/- 2.299 mg dL(-1)). The result suggests that OCs increase 
      the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG).

      hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.
PG  - 247-53
LID - 10.4103/0974-8490.118811 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bryophyllum pinnatum Lam. used in folk medicine in tropical Africa, 
      tropical America, India, China and Australia contains a wide range of active 
      compounds, well known for their haemostatic and wound-healing properties. 
      OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to evaluate the effect of Bryophyllum 
      pinnatum Lam. on N-diethylnitrosamine (DENA)-induced hepatic injury in rats. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The aerial part of B. pinnatum aqueous and ethanolic 
      extract was prepared in doses of 250 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg. Hepatic injury was 
      induced by DENA. Acute toxicity was also carried out. RESULT: Treatment with 
      different doses of ethanolic extract of B. Pinnatum (250 mg/kg, p.o.) was not 
      significantly able to treat the liver injury induced by DENA, but 500 mg/kg dose 
      of ethanolic extract of B. Pinnatum protects the liver slightly. Treatment with 
      different doses of aqueous extract of B. Pinnatum (250 and 500 mg/kg, p.o.) 
      significantly (P*<0.05; P**<0.01 and P***<0.001) treated the liver injury induced 
      by DENA. CONCLUSION: It may be inferred from the present study that the 
      hepatoprotective activities of the aqueous extract of B. Pinnatum leaves in 
      DENA-induced hepatotoxicity may involve its antioxidant or oxidative free radical 
      scavenging activities by alleviating lipid peroxidation through scavenging of 
      free radicals, or by enhancing the activity of antioxidants.

AB  - Genomic abnormalities leading to colorectal cancer (CRC) include somatic events 
      causing copy number aberrations (CNAs) as well as copy neutral manifestations 
      such as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD). We studied the 
      causal effect of these events by analyzing high resolution cytogenetic microarray 
      data of 15 tumor-normal paired samples. We detected 144 genes affected by CNAs. A 
      subset of 91 genes are known to be CRC related yet high GISTIC scores indicate 24 
      genes on chromosomes 7, 8, 18 and 20 to be strongly relevant. Combining GISTIC 
      ranking with functional analyses and degree of loss/gain we identify three genes 
      in regions of significant loss (ATP8B1, NARS, and ATP5A1) and eight in regions of 
      gain (CTCFL, SPO11, ZNF217, PLEKHA8, HOXA3, GPNMB, IGF2BP3 and PCAT1) as novel in 
      their association with CRC. Pathway and target prediction analysis of CNA 
      affected genes and microRNAs, respectively indicates TGF-beta signaling pathway to 
      be involved in causing CRC. Finally, LOH and UPD collectively affected nine 
      cancer related genes. Transcription factor binding sites on regions of >35% copy 
      number loss/gain influenced 16 CRC genes. Our analysis shows patient specific CRC 
      manifestations at the genomic level and that these different events affect 
      individual CRC patients differently.

AB  - The most common benign tumour of the oesophagus is leiomyoma. Haemopoietic 
      elements rarely infiltrate oesophageal leiomyoma. We report the case of a 
      24-year-old man with a long history of intermittent dysphagia. Endoscopy revealed 
      external compression with normal oesophageal mucosa. A barium swallow study 
      showed a defect in the oesophageal wall and a narrow oesophageal lumen. A CT scan 
      of the chest confirmed a mass in the mid-oesophagus. A tumour was excised and the 
      histology report revealed leiomyoma infiltrated with eosinophils, which is a rare 
      variant.

TI  - RNA-SSPT: RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Tools.
PG  - 873-8
LID - 10.6026/97320630009873 [doi]
AB  - The prediction of RNA structure is useful for understanding evolution for both in 
      silico and in vitro studies. Physical methods like NMR studies to predict RNA 
      secondary structure are expensive and difficult. Computational RNA secondary 
      structure prediction is easier. Comparative sequence analysis provides the best 
      solution. But secondary structure prediction of a single RNA sequence is 
      challenging. RNA-SSPT is a tool that computationally predicts secondary structure 
      of a single RNA sequence. Most of the RNA secondary structure prediction tools do 
      not allow pseudoknots in the structure or are unable to locate them. Nussinov 
      dynamic programming algorithm has been implemented in RNA-SSPT. The current 
      studies shows only energetically most favorable secondary structure is required 
      and the algorithm modification is also available that produces base pairs to 
      lower the total free energy of the secondary structure. For visualization of RNA 
      secondary structure, NAVIEW in C language is used and modified in C# for tool 
      requirement. RNA-SSPT is built in C# using Dot Net 2.0 in Microsoft Visual Studio 
      2005 Professional edition. The accuracy of RNA-SSPT is tested in terms of 
      Sensitivity and Positive Predicted Value. It is a tool which serves both 
      secondary structure prediction and secondary structure visualization purposes.

      and [C(2)(2)H(5)(8)N(6)O(1)(7)NiSnCl(2)] (4) were synthesized from their monometallic analogs

      vitro DNA binding studies of L and complexes (1-4) with CT DNA were carried out 
      by employing various biophysical and molecular docking techniques which revealed 
      that heterobimetallic complex 3 strongly binds to DNA in comparison to 4, 
      monometallic complexes (1 and 2) and the free ligand. Complex 3 cleaves pBR322 
      DNA via hydrolytic pathway (confirmed by T4 DNA ligase assay) and inhibited 
      Topo-II activity in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, complex 3 was docked 
      into the ATPase domain of human-Topo-II in order to probe the possible mechanism 
      of inhibition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (HT) are among the 
      most common non-communicable chronic diseases in developed and developing 
      countries around the world. The study reports the prevalence of DM and HT and its 
      influence from its possible risk factors. METHODS: Individuals of both sexes 
      (Male-1099, Female-669) belonging to six different populations were randomly 
      selected and screened for diabetes and hypertension following from different 
      districts of Manipur, which is a small hilly state, situated in the north eastern 
      extreme corner of India sharing an international boundary with Myanmar (Burma). 
      "Diabetes mellitus" and "hypertension" were defined by the American Diabetes 
      Association and the Joint National Committee's 7th Report guidelines, 
      respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in the 
      entire study population was found to be 16.63% and 18.16% respectively. About 
      13.8% individuals had shown co-prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension. 
      The association of Diabetes Mellitus with different risk factors such as 
      consumption of alcohol and difference in physical activities were found to be 
      statistically significant. The association of Diabetes Mellitus with different 
      populations and age groups are also statistically significant. The association 
      between Hypertension with different populations and different physical activities 
      were also found to be statistically significant.

      weight, completely eliminated filarial parasites from systemic circulation on 60 
      days post-infection in animals inflicted with B. malayi. In contrast, the 
      coadministration of nano-IVM (F5) along with standard filaricide 
      diethylcarbamazine (DEC) was found to be competent enough to suppress 
      microfilarial stage of parasites and successfully eliminated microfilaria at 45 
      days posttreatment. However, the free form of both the drugs alone or in 
      combination was unable to impart such suppression and followed by recurrence of 
      the infection. Interestingly, nano-IVM (F5) was also found to be effective 
      against adult stage parasites causing 36.67 % worm mortality and 75.89 % in 
      combination with DEC; however, female sterilization remain almost similar. Thus, 
      the combination of entrapped IVM with DEC exhibited enhanced microfilaricidal and 
      marginally better macrofilaricidal efficacy than any of the single formulation or 
      drugs combination.

TI  - Ulnar aplasia, dysplastic radius and preaxial oligodactyly: Rare longitudinal 
      limb defect in a sporadic male child.
PG  - 818-21
AB  - Ulnar hypoplasia is a rare longitudinal limb deficiency in which the ulna shows 
      various degrees of deficiency. The condition is normally associated with radial 
      defects, and in severe cases there is a reduction of postaxial/ulnar digits. 
      Ulnar deficiency is an integral part of several syndromic malformations like 
      Weyer's oligodactyly syndrome, limb/pelvis hypoplasia/aplasia syndrome, and 
      ulnar-mammary syndrome. Here, we report an isolated unilateral ulnar deficiency 
      in a boy who was a product of a consanguineous marriage. The subject demonstrated 
      mesomelic shortening of the left arm with reduced zeugopod and autopod, and 
      preaxial absence of two fingers. Additional findings in the affected limb were 
      severe flexion contracture at the elbow joint, reduced and narrow palm, 
      hypoplastic digits, and clinodactyly. Roentgenographic study revealed rudimentary 
      ulna, dysplastic and posteriorly dislocated radius, crowding of carpals, and 
      complete absence of digit rays of the thumb and index finger. Despite this 
      anomaly, the subject could manage his daily life activities well. We present 
      detailed clinical features and differential diagnosis of this rare limb 
      malformation.

AB  - Optimum culture conditions, and carbon and nitrogen sources for production of 
      water absorbing exopolysaccharide by Bacillus strain CMG1403 on local cheap 
      substrates were determined using one variable at a time approach. Carbon source 
      was found to be sole substrate for EPS biosynthesis in the presence of yeast 
      extract that supported the growth only and hence, indirectly enhanced the EPS 
      yield. Whereas, urea only coupled with carbon source could enhance the EPS 
      production but no effect on growth. The maximum yield of EPS was obtained when 
      Bacillus strain CMG1403 was grown statically in neutral minimal medium with 25% 
      volumetric aeration at 30 degrees C for 10 days. Under these optimum conditions, a 
      maximum yield of 2.71+/-0.024, 3.82+/-0.005, 4.33+/-0.021, 4.73+/-0.021, 4.85+/-0.024, and 
      5.52+/-0.016 g/L culture medium was obtained with 20 g (sugar) of sweet whey, 
      glucose, fructose, sucrose, cane molasses and sugar beet the most efficient one 
      respectively as carbon sources. Thus, the present study showed that under optimum 
      culture conditions, the local cheap substrates could be superior and efficient 
      alternatives to synthetic carbon sources providing way for an economical 
      production of water absorbing EPS by indigenous soil bacterium Bacillus strain 
      CMG1403.

AB  - Fuel pin decontamination is the process of removing particulates of radioactive 
      material from its exterior surface. It is an important process step in nuclear 
      fuel fabrication. It assumes more significance with plutonium bearing fuel known 
      to be highly radio-toxic owing to its relatively longer biological half life and 
      shorter radiological half life. Release of even minute quantity of plutonium 
      oxide powder in the atmosphere during its handling can cause alarming air borne 
      activity and may pose a severe health hazard to personnel working in the 
      vicinity. Decontamination of fuel pins post pellet loading operation is thus 
      mandatory before they are removed from the glove box for further processing and 
      assembly. This paper describes the setting up of ultrasonic decontamination 
      process, installed inside a custom built fume-hood in the production line, 
      comprising of a cleaning tank with transducers, heaters, pin handling device and 
      water filtration system and its application in cleaning of fuel pins for 
      prototype fast breeder reactor. The cleaning process yielded a typical 
      decontamination efficiency of more than 99%.

      technique in intensity modulated radiotherapy.
PG  - 101-6
LID - 10.1016/j.rpor.2012.10.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The demand of improved dose conformity of the tumor has been 
      increased in radiation therapy with the advent of recent imaging facilities and 
      efficient computer technologies. AIM: We compared the intensity modulated 
      radiotherapy (IMRT) plans delivered with the sliding window (SW IMRT) and step 
      and shoot (SS IMRT) techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients were 
      planned on 15 MV X-ray for five, seven, nine and thirteen beams direction making 
      the dose constraints analogous. Eclipse treatment planning system with Helios 
      inverse planning software, and Linear Accelerator Varian 2100 C/D with 120 
      multileaf collimators (MLCs) were used. Gamma analysis was applied to the data 
      acquired with the MapCheck 2 for different beam directions plan in the sliding 
      window and step and shoot technique to meet the 95% pass criteria at 3%/3 mm. The 
      plans were scrutinized using D mean, D max, D1%, D95%, dose uniformity index 
      (UI), dose conformity index (CI), dose homogeneity index (HI) and monitor units 
      (MUs). RESULTS: Our data show comparable coverage of the planning target volume 
      (PTV) for both the sliding window and step and shoot techniques. The volume of 
      PTV receiving the prescription dose was 99.8 +/- 0.05% and the volume of PTV 
      receiving the maximum dose was 107.6 +/- 2.5% in both techniques. Bladder and 
      rectum maximum mean doses for the sliding window and step and shoot plans were 
      38.1 +/- 2.6% and 42.9 +/- 10.7%. Homogeneity index (HI) for both techniques was 
      0.12 +/- 0.02 and 0.13 +/- 0.02, uniformity index (UI) was 1.07 +/- 0.02 and 108 +/- 0.01 
      and conformity index at 98% isodose (CI 98%) was 0.96 +/- 0.005 and 0.96 +/- 0.005 
      for the sliding window and step and shoot techniques, respectively, and MUs were 
      10 +/- 12% lower in the step and shoot compared to the sliding window technique. 
      CONCLUSION: All these factors indicate that coverage for PTV was nearly identical 
      but dose to organs-at-risk (OARs) was lower in the step and shoot technique.

PG  - 395-407
LID - 10.3109/1061186X.2013.869823 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the antifilarial, antiwolbachial 
      and DNA topoisomerase II inhibitory activity of nanocurcumin (nano-CUR). METHODS: 
      Nano-CUR formulations (F1-F6) were prepared using free radical polymerization and 
      were characterized by particle size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency and in 
      vitro release kinetics. Antifilarial potential was evaluated in vivo against 
      Brugian filariasis in an experimental rodent model, Mastomys coucha, by selecting 
      the formulation that maximized parasite elimination characteristics. Wolbachial 
      status was determined by PCR and a relaxation assay was used to estimate DNA 
      topoisomerase II inhibitory activity. RESULTS: Nano-CUR (F3) having a 60 nm 
      diameter and 89.78% entrapment efficiency showed the most favorable 
      characteristics for the elimination of filarial parasites. In vivo 
      pharmacokinetic and organ distribution studies demonstrate significantly greater 
      C(max) (86.6 +/- 2.56 ng ml(-1)), AUC0-infinity (796 +/- 89.8 ng d ml(-1)), MRT (19.5 +/- 7.82 
      days) and bioavailability of CUR (70.02%) in the organs from which the adult 
      parasites were recovered. The optimized nano-CUR (F3) (5 x 5 mg/kg, orally) 
      significantly augmented the microfilariciadal and adulticidal action of CUR over 
      free CUR (5 x 50 mg/kg, orally) or Diethylcarbamizine (50 mg/kg, orally) against 
      the Brugia malayi Mastomys coucha rodent model. The PCR results showed complete 
      elimination of wolbachia from the recovered female parasites. Interestingly, 
      nano-CUR was also found to be a novel inhibitor of filarial worm DNA 
      topoisomerase II, Setaria Cervi in vitro. CONCLUSION: This study recognizes the 
      beforehand antimicrofilarial, antimacrofilarial, anti-wolbachial activity of 
      nano-CUR (F3) over free forms and additionally its strong inhibitory action 
      against the major target filarial parasite enzyme DNA topoisomerase II in vitro.

AB  - Tracheal diverticulum is a rare benign disease also known as paratracheal air 
      cyst. Mostly these are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on radiologic 
      examination of the chest. Common symptoms are cough, recurrent respiratory tract 
      infections, and sometimes dysphagia. Herein we report a rare case of hoarseness 
      of voice caused by tracheal diverticulum. Computed tomography scan of neck 
      revealed a large tracheal diverticulum, probably compressing the recurrent 
      laryngeal nerve as bronchoscopy showed impaired right vocal cord movement. Two 
      weeks after diverticulectomy, the patient's voice returned to normal.

AB  - A study was undertaken to record gene frequencies of ABO blood groups, their 
      subtypes and Rh antigen for six different endogamous groups including a tribal 
      population. The ABO phenotypic frequency varies among six different populations 
      showing significant difference (p<0.0005). Gujjar and Bakarwal (a tribal 
      population) shows highest (42.29%) of B blood phenotypes. A1 is the highest among 
      Syeds (39.31%), O blood group frequency highest among Mughals (43.23%) and A1B 
      and A2B are rare phenotypes showing very low frequency among all populations. The 
      pattern of allele frequencies (p<0.025) is in order of I(O)>I(B)>I(A1)>I(A2), 
      except Syeds (I(O)>I(A1)>I(B)>I(A2)). The rhesus protein (Rh) phenotypic 
      frequency (p<0.01) shows significant increase in Rh(D) positive (87.86% in Syed 
      to 96.03% in Khan) among all populations. The Rh allele (p<0.05) and genotype 
      (p<0.02) frequencies shows a significant difference. Heterozygosity for Rh 
      protein is less than homozygosity among six populations. The result from this 
      study provides information on the genetic variation in blood antigens and rhesus 
      protein among human populations inhabiting Jammu and Kashmir.

AB  - New metal-based anticancer chemotherapeutic drug candidates [Cu(phen)L](NO(3))(2) (1) 
      and [Zn(phen)L](NO(3))(2) (2) were synthesized from ligand L (derived from 
      pharmacophore scaffold barbituric acid and pyrazole). In vitro DNA binding 
      studies of the L, 1 and 2 were carried out by various biophysical techniques 
      revealing electrostatic mode. Complex 1 cleaves pBR322 DNA via oxidative pathway 
      and recognizes major groove of DNA double helix. The molecular docking study was 
      carried out to ascertain the mode of action towards the molecular target DNA and 
      enzymes. The complex 1 exhibited remarkably good anticancer activity on a panel 
      of human cancer cell lines (GI(5)(0) values < 10 mug/ml), and to elucidate the 
      mechanism of cancer inhibition, Topo-I enzymatic activity was carried out.

TI  - Antidiabetic potential of triterpenoid saponin isolated from Primula denticulate.
PG  - 750-5
LID - 10.3109/13880209.2013.869759 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Primula denticulate Sm. (Primulaceae), commonly known as drumstick 
      primula, is traditionally used to treat diabetes and urinary disorders. In the 
      present study, a new triterpenoid saponin was isolated. Triterpenoids generally 
      show antidiabetic activity. Considering its traditional use and chemical nature 
      of the molecule, the present study was designed to evaluate the antidiabetic 
      activity. OBJECTIVE: Antidiabetic activity of triterpenoid saponin (TTS) isolated 
      from P. denticulate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A new TTS was isolated from the leaf 
      of P. denticulate by column chromatography on CHCl3/MeOH (8.5:1.5) fraction. It 
      was further characterized by using NMR, UV, and IR spectroscopic methods. Ethanol 
      and aqueous extracts of the leaf were also prepared. Antidiabetic study for TTS, 
      ethanol extract, and aqueous extract was carried out in streptozotocin 
      (STZ)-induced diabetic rats at doses of 200, 1000, and 1000 mg/kg body weight, 
      respectively. A toxicity study was also performed. RESULTS: Isolated new TTS 
      molecule was characterized as 
      3-O[beta-d-xylopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-alpha-l-arabinopyranosyloxy]-16alpha-hydroxy-13beta,28-epoxy-olean-30-al 
      by NMR, UV, and IR spectroscopic methods. This new TTS was found to be effective 
      in lowering blood-glucose level in the experimental rat model, thus establishing 
      its antidiabetic property (168.8   +/- 4.58) when compared with disease control 
      (258.8 +/- 0.60). Its LD50 value was found at a dose of 2000 mg/kg. The level of 
      insulin was restored by TTS and ethanol extract up to 31.49 microU/ml and 38.90 
      microU/ml, respectively, when compared with disease control (18.45 microU/ml). DISCUSSION 
      AND CONCLUSION: In conclusion, 
      3-O[beta-d-xylopyranosyl-(1 --> 2)-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-(1 --> 4)-alpha-l-arabinopyranosyloxy]-16alpha-hydroxy-3beta,28-epoxy-olean-30-al 
      possesses potential glucose lowering properties, i.e., antidiabetic potential 
      against STZ-induced diabetic rats.

TI  - Incidence of congenital heart disease among neonates in a neonatal unit of a 
      tertiary care hospital.
PG  - 175-8
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and pattern of various congenital heart 
      disease in a neonatal unit of a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: The prospective 
      study was carried out in the neonatal unit of Combined Military Hospital, 
      Rawalpindi, from September 2008 to August 2011. All 5800 neonates admitted with 
      gestational age of > 28 weeks irrespective of birthweight were included in the 
      study. Neonatologist/Paediatrician carried out the neonatal examination during 
      the first 12 hours of life. Neonates suspected of having congenital heart disease 
      were further evaluated by pulse oxymetry, X-ray chest and echocardiography to 
      ascertain final diagnosis and type of lesion. Data was collected on a predesigned 
      proforma containing information regarding gender, mode of delivery, gestational 
      age, weight at birth, family history, and associated malformations. SPSS 16 was 
      used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Of the 5800 neonates, 87 (1.5%) were 
      found to have congenital heart disease with an incidence of 15/1000. There was a 
      male preponderance. Most common lesion was ventricular septal defect 27 (31.3%), 
      followed by atrial septal defect 20 (22.9%), patent ductus arteriosus 13 
      (14.94%), tetralogy of fallot 06 (6.89%), transposition of great arteries 04 
      (4.59%), Pulmonary stenosis 05 (5.79%) and 03 (3.44%) had atrioventricular canal 
      defects. CONCLUSION: Congenital heart disease is a common congenital anomaly. Its 
      incidence varies from centre to centre due to different factors like nature of 
      the sample, method of detection and early examination by a 
      neonatologist/paediatrician. In this study a higher incidence is reported because 
      it was carried out in a tertiary care unit, which is a referral hospital and all 
      the neonates admitted in the unit were included in the study.

AB  - There is no well-established in vivo marker of nigral degeneration in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD). An ideal imaging marker would directly mirror the loss of 
      substantia nigra dopaminergic neurones, which is most prominent in sub-regions 
      called nigrosomes. High-resolution, iron-sensitive, magnetic resonance imaging 
      (MRI) at 7T allows direct nigrosome-1 visualisation in healthy people but not in 
      PD. Here, we investigated the feasibility of nigrosome-1 detection using 3T - 
      susceptibility-weighted (SWI) MRI and the diagnostic accuracy that can be 
      achieved for diagnosing PD in a clinical population. 114 high-resolution 3T - 
      SWI-scans were reviewed consisting of a prospective case-control study in 19 
      subjects (10 PD, 9 controls) and a retrospective cross-sectional study in 95 
      consecutive patients undergoing routine clinical SWI-scans (>50 years, 9 PD, 81 
      non-PD, 5 non-diagnostic studies excluded). Two raters independently classified 
      subjects into PD and non-PD according to absence or presence of nigrosome-1, 
      followed by consensus reading. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed against clinical 
      diagnosis as gold standard. Absolute inter- and intra-rater agreement was >/=94% 
      (kappa>/=0.82, p<0.001). In the prospective study 8/9 control and 8/10 PD; and in 
      the retrospective study 77/81 non-PD and all 9 PD subjects were correctly 
      classified. Diagnostic accuracy of the retrospective cohort was: sensitivity 
      100%, specificity 95%, NPV 1, PPV 0.69 and accuracy 96% which dropped to 91% when 
      including non-diagnostic scans ('intent to diagnose'). The healthy nigrosome-1 
      can be readily depicted on high-resolution 3T - SWI giving rise to a 'swallow 
      tail' appearance of the dorsolateral substantia nigra, and this feature is lost 
      in PD. Visual radiological assessment yielded a high diagnostic accuracy for PD 
      vs. an unselected clinical control population. Assessing the substantia nigra on 
      SWI for the typical 'swallow tail' appearance has potential to become a new and 
      easy applicable 3T MRI diagnostic tool for nigral degeneration in PD.

AB  - Textile effluent is one of the main contributors of water pollution and it 
      adversely affects fauna and flora. Constructed wetland is a promising approach to 
      remediate the industrial effluent. The detoxification of industrial effluent in a 
      constructed wetland system may be enhanced by applying beneficial bacteria that 
      are able to degrade contaminants present in industrial effluent. The aim of this 
      study was to evaluate the influence of inoculation of textile effluent-degrading 
      endophytic bacteria on the detoxification of textile effluent in a vertical flow 
      constructed wetland reactor. A wetland plant, Typha domingensis, was vegetated in 
      reactor and inoculated with two endophytic bacterial strains, Microbacterium 
      arborescens TYSI04 and Bacillus pumilus PIRI30. These strains possessed textile 
      effluent-degrading and plant growth-promoting activities. Results indicated that 
      bacterial inoculation improved plant growth, textile effluent degradation and 
      mutagenicity reduction and were correlated with the population of textile 
      effluent-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere and endosphere of T. domingensis. 
      Bacterial inoculation enhanced textile effluent-degrading bacterial population in 
      rhizosphere, root and shoot of T. domingensis. Significant reductions in COD 
      (79%), BOD (77%) TDS (59%) and TSS (27%) were observed by the combined use of 
      plants and bacteria within 72 h. The resultant effluent meets the wastewater 
      discharge standards of Pakistan and can be discharged into the environment 
      without any risks. This study revealed that the combined use of plant and 
      endophytic bacteria is one of the approaches to enhance textile effluent 
      degradation in a constructed wetland system.

AB  - Polymer inclusion membranes (PIM) containing TODGA (N,N,N',N'-tetra-n-octyl 
      diglycolamide) were evaluated for the separation of actinide ions such as Am(3+), 
      Pu(4+), UO2(2+) and Th(4+) from acidic feeds. The PIMs were prepared using 
      cellulose triacetate (CTA) as the polymer matrix and 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether 
      (NPOE) as the plasticizer along with the diglycolamide carrier extractants and 
      were characterized by conventional techniques such as XRD, thermal analysis and 
      AFM. The PIM composition was optimized by a series of studies which involved 
      variation in the CTA, NPOE and carrier concentration which suggested 58% TODGA, 
      30% NPOE and 12% CTA to be optimum. The uptake studies were carried out using 
      feed solutions containing varying concentrations of nitric acid and showed the 
      trend: Am(3+)>Pu(4+)>Th(4+)>UO2(2+). Transport studies were carried out in a 
      two-compartment cell where nitric acid concentration the feed was varied (1-3M) 
      while the receiver compartment contained alpha-hydroxy-iso-butyric acid (AHIBA). 
      The actinide ion transport efficiencies with TODGA containing PIMs followed the 
      same trend as seen in the uptake studies. The AFM patterns of the PIMs changed 
      when loaded with Eu(3+) carrier (used as a surrogate for Am(3+)) while the 
      regenerated membranes have displayed comparable morphologies. Diffusion 
      coefficient values were experimentally obtained from the transport studies and 
      were found to be 8.89x10(-8) cm(2)/s for Am(3+) transport.

TI  - Coeliac disease--clinical presentation and diagnosis by anti tissue 
      transglutaminase antibodies titre in children.
PG  - 437-41
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the spectrum of clinical presentation of coeliac disease and 
      the role of IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies titer in the diagnosis 
      and effect of gluten-free diet on such titers in children. METHODS: The 
      prospective study was conducted in the paediatric department of Combined Military 
      Hospital, Kharian from Sep 2011 to Sep 2012. Children of 1-12 years of age 
      presenting with chronic diarrhoea, malnutrition and failure to thrive were 
      included regardless of gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity and geographical 
      distribution. Anti-tissue transglutaminase angibodies titers were done on 
      enrolment. Patients with levels more than 30 u/ml were enrolled. They were 
      advised strict gluten-free diet for six months. These titers were repeated after 
      six months to document the effect of gluten-free diet on these titers. Paediatric 
      endoscopy and duodenal biopsy facilities were not available at the study site, so 
      the response was monitored through titers. Data was analysed using SPSS-20. 
      RESULTS: Out of 61 patients with IgA levels more than 10 u/ml, 52 (85.24%) were 
      found to have a positive (> 30u/ml) anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies 
      titers with a mean value of 42.67 +/- 7.60 U/ml. These 52 patients were then put 
      on a trial of gluten-free diet for six months after which significant reduction 
      in titer was noticed, with a mean value of 13.25 +/- 2.59 U/ml. This reduction in 
      titer was associated with marked clinical improvement and regression of symptoms. 
      Frequency of different clinical features in descending order revealed that 
      chronic diarrhoea, abdominal distension, iron deficiency anaemia, failure to 
      thrive, pallor and rickets were present in 38 (73.1%), 30 (57.7%), 29 (55.8%), 29 
      (53.8%), 28 (53.8%) patients respectively. CONCLUSION: Chronic diarrhoea, failure 
      to thrive, pallor, abdominal distention and iron deficiency anaemia were common 
      modes of presentation. The antibodies were strongly positive in most of the 
      cases. All children showed significant improvement in clinical features and 
      reduction in antibody titers after six-month trial of gluten free diet.

AB  - Bicyclic heterocyclic compounds viz. benzothiazoles are key components of 
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules and participate directly in the encoding of 
      genetic information. Benzothiazoles, therefore, represent a potent and selective 
      class of antitumor compounds. The design and synthesis of chiral antitumor 
      chemotherapeutic agents of Cu(II) and Zn(II), L- and -D benzothiazole Schiff 
      base-valine complexes 1a &b and 2a &b, respectively were carried out and 
      thoroughly characterized by spectroscopic and analytical techniques. Interaction 
      of 1a and b and 2a and b with CT DNA by employing UV-vis, florescence, circular 
      dichroic methods and cleavage studies of 1a with pBR322 plasmid, molecular 
      docking were done in order to demonstrate their enantiomeric disposition toward 
      the molecular drug target DNA. Interestingly, these studies unambiguously 
      demonstrated the greater potency of L-enantiomer in comparison to D-enantiomer.

PG  - 499-504
LID - 10.1038/ja.2014.35 [doi]
AB  - It is a well-known fact that to bring a new molecule it may take more than a 
      decade. The existing drugs, which are known for their adverse reaction or 
      toxicity, if utilized and allowed in different formulation, the new effective 
      formulation may be discovered and developed. This may help in reducing various 
      side effects, time and costs. In this study, fungal infection was inoculated 
      superficially over the skin of guinea pigs and treated with the broad-spectrum 
      antimicrobial (gatifloxacin) in combination with non-toxic and effective amount 
      of copper ions. MIC of copper (0.20%) was also determined. Concentration of 
      gatifloxacin (100 mug ml(-1)) with the combination of copper ions (MIC) at which 
      it inhibits the visible growth of fungal strains was also evaluated. 
      Hematological parameters, such as total leukocyte count and differential 
      leukocyte count, were evaluated. The results have shown increase in these 
      parameters after fungal infection, which reaches its normal value after treatment 
      with the combination of gatifloxacin and copper ions. Outcomes of the research 
      concluded that gatifloxacin 100 mug ml(-1) can be used by 0.20% of copper ions to 
      prevent growth of some fungal strains (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger), 
      which causes skin infections with more potency.

TI  - Antenatal Bartter syndrome.
PG  - S121-3
AB  - Antenatal Bartter syndrome is characterized by severe polyhydramnios in mother 
      leading to premature delivery. Antenatal treatment has proven effective to 
      prevent these problems. Postnatally newborns suffer from recurrent episodes of 
      severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance which can lead to fatal outcome. 
      These manifestations are likely to be overlooked and missed under the umbrella of 
      diagnosis of prematurity. This premature newborn with antenatal polyhydramnios 
      had severe manifestations of polyuria, recurrent dehydration, electrolyte 
      derangements and metabolic alkalosis. She was managed accordingly but 
      unfortunately could not survive beyond 4 weeks.

TI  - Combined use of alkane-degrading and plant growth-promoting bacteria enhanced 
      phytoremediation of diesel contaminated soil.
PG  - 1268-77
AB  - Inoculation of plants with pollutant-degrading and plant growth-promoting 
      microorganisms is a simple strategy to enhance phytoremediation activity. The 
      objective of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation of different 
      bacterial strains, possessing alkane-degradation and 1-amino-cyclopropane-1 
      -carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase activity, on plant growth and phytoremediation 
      activity. Carpet grass (Axonopus affinis) was planted in soil spiked with diesel 
      (1% w/w) for 90 days and inoculated with different bacterial strains, Pseudomonas 
      sp. ITRH25, Pantoea sp. BTRH79 and Burkholderia sp. PsJN, individually and in 
      combination. Generally, bacterial application increased total numbers of 
      culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere ofcarpet grass, 
      plant biomass production, hydrocarbon degradation and reduced genotoxicity. 
      Bacterial strains possessing different beneficial traits affect plant growth and 
      phytoremediation activity in different ways. Maximum bacterial population, plant 
      biomass production and hydrocarbon degradation were achieved when carpet grass 
      was inoculated with a consortium of three strains. Enhanced plant biomass 
      production and hydrocarbon degradation were associated with increased numbers of 
      culturable hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria in the rhizosphere of carpet grass. The 
      present study revealed that the combined use of different bacterial strains, 
      exhibiting different beneficial traits, is a highly effective strategy to improve 
      plant growth and phytoremediation activity.

TI  - LacR is a repressor of lacABCD and LacT is an activator of lacTFEG, constituting 
      the lac gene cluster in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
PG  - 5349-58
LID - 10.1128/AEM.01370-14 [doi]
AB  - Comparison of the transcriptome of Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39 grown in 
      the presence of either lactose or galactose with that of the strain grown in the 
      presence of glucose revealed the elevated expression of various genes and 
      operons, including the lac gene cluster, which is organized into two operons, 
      i.e., lac operon I (lacABCD) and lac operon II (lacTFEG). Deletion of the DeoR 
      family transcriptional regulator lacR that is present downstream of the lac gene 
      cluster revealed elevated expression of lac operon I even in the absence of 
      lactose. This suggests a function of LacR as a transcriptional repressor of lac 
      operon I, which encodes enzymes involved in the phosphorylated tagatose pathway 
      in the absence of lactose or galactose. Deletion of lacR did not affect the 
      expression of lac operon II, which encodes a lactose-specific phosphotransferase. 
      This finding was further confirmed by beta-galactosidase assays with PlacA-lacZ and 
      PlacT-lacZ in the presence of either lactose or glucose as the sole carbon source 
      in the medium. This suggests the involvement of another transcriptional regulator 
      in the regulation of lac operon II, which is the BglG-family transcriptional 
      antiterminator LacT. We demonstrate the role of LacT as a transcriptional 
      activator of lac operon II in the presence of lactose and CcpA-independent 
      regulation of the lac gene cluster in S. pneumoniae.

      synthesized and characterized by analytical, spectroscopic and single crystal 
      X-ray diffraction. In vitro DNA binding studies of 1 was performed by employing 
      UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopic techniques. The binding affinity towards 
      human serum albumin (HSA) was also investigated to understand the carrier role in 
      body system, as the time dependent HPLC experiment of 1 revealed that bonded drug 
      with protein releases slowly in presence of DNA. Complex 1 exhibited good 
      anti-tumor activity (GI50 values <10 mug/ml), and to elucidate the mechanism of 
      tumor inhibition, topoisomerase I enzymatic activity was carried out and further 
      validated by cell imaging studies which clearly showed its nuclear localization.

TI  - An adaptive semantic based mediation system for data interoperability among 
      Health Information Systems.

LID - 10.1007/s10916-014-0028-y [doi]
AB  - Heterogeneity in the management of the complex medical data, obstructs the 
      attainment of data level interoperability among Health Information Systems (HIS). 
      This diversity is dependent on the compliance of HISs with different healthcare 
      standards. Its solution demands a mediation system for the accurate 
      interpretation of data in different heterogeneous formats for achieving data 
      interoperability. We propose an adaptive AdapteR Interoperability ENgine 
      mediation system called ARIEN, that arbitrates between HISs compliant to 
      different healthcare standards for accurate and seamless information exchange to 
      achieve data interoperability. ARIEN stores the semantic mapping information 
      between different standards in the Mediation Bridge Ontology (MBO) using ontology 
      matching techniques. These mappings are provided by our System for Parallel 
      Heterogeneity (SPHeRe) matching system and Personalized-Detailed Clinical Model 
      (P-DCM) approach to guarantee accuracy of mappings. The realization of the 
      effectiveness of the mappings stored in the MBO is evaluation of the accuracy in 
      transformation process among different standard formats. We evaluated our 
      proposed system with the transformation process of medical records between 
      Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) and Virtual Medical Record (vMR) standards. 
      The transformation process achieved over 90 % of accuracy level in conversion 
      process between CDA and vMR standards using pattern oriented approach from the 
      MBO. The proposed mediation system improves the overall communication process 
      between HISs. It provides an accurate and seamless medical information exchange 
      to ensure data interoperability and timely healthcare services to patients.

TI  - Formulation and evaluation of sustained release matrix tablet of rabeprazole 
      using wet granulation technique.
PG  - 180-4
LID - 10.4103/0975-7406.130961 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Rabeprazole, a member of substituted benzimidazoles, inhibits the 
      final step in gastric acid secretions. This drug claims to cause fastest acid 
      separation (due to higher pKa), and more rapidly converts to the active species 
      to aid gastric mucin synthesis. The most significant pharmacological action of 
      Rabeprazole is dose dependent suppression of gastric acid secretion; without 
      anticholinergic or H2-blocking action. It completely abolishes the hydrochloric 
      acid secretion as it is powerful inhibitor of gastric acid. Rabeprazole is acid 
      labile and hence commonly formulated as an enteric coated tablet. The absorption 
      of rabeprazole occurs rapidly as soon as tablet leaves the stomach. AIM: In the 
      present study an attempt was made to formulate and evaluate Rabeprazole sustained 
      release matrix tablet using wet granulation technique incorporating various 
      polymers like HPMC-E15, Carbopol934, and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Formulated tablets were evaluated for different 
      physicochemical properties like rheological properties, weight variation, 
      thickness, hardness, % friability, in vitro release studies and drug content. 
      RESULTS: Studies revealed that all the physicochemical parameters comply with the 
      official standards. The in vitro release studies exhibits the release up to 90%, 
      over a prolonged period of time which confirms the extended release profile of 
      formulation, having better bioavailability as well as decreased dosing frequency 
      with reduced doses. CONCLUSION: The sustained release matrix tablets of 
      rabiprazole shown better bioavailability, efficacy and potency, when compared 
      with official standards.

AB  - We have developed an immunochromatographic test for the diagnosis of peste des 
      petits ruminants (PPR) under field conditions. The diagnostic assay has been 
      tested in the laboratory and also under field conditions in Ivory Coast, 
      Pakistan, Ethiopia and Uganda. The test is carried out on a superficial swab 
      sample (ocular or nasal) and showed a sensitivity of 84% relative to PCR. The 
      specificity was 95% over all nasal and ocular samples. The test detected as 
      little as 10(3) TCID50 (50% tissue culture infectious doses) of cell 
      culture-grown virus, and detected virus isolates representing all four known 
      genetic lineages of peste des petits ruminants virus. Virus could be detected in 
      swabs from animals as early as 4 days post-infection, at a time when clinical 
      signs were minimal. Feedback from field trials was uniformly positive, suggesting 
      that this diagnostic tool may be useful for current efforts to control the spread 
      of PPR.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increased effort to enhance the efficacy of 
      phytoremediation of contaminated environments by exploiting plant-microbe 
      interactions. The combined use of plants and endophytic bacteria is an emerging 
      approach for the clean-up of soil and water polluted with organic compounds. In 
      plant-endophyte partnerships, plants provide the habitat as well as nutrients to 
      their associated endophytic bacteria. In response, endophytic bacteria with 
      appropriate degradation pathways and metabolic activities enhance degradation of 
      organic pollutants, and diminish phytotoxicity and evapotranspiration of organic 
      pollutants. Moreover, endophytic bacteria possessing plant growth-promoting 
      activities enhance the plant's adaptation and growth in soil and water 
      contaminated with organic pollutants. Overall, the application of endophytic 
      bacteria gives new insights into novel protocols to improve phytoremediation 
      efficiency. However, successful application of plant-endophyte partnerships for 
      the clean-up of an environment contaminated with organic compounds depends on the 
      abundance and activity of the degrading endophyte in different plant 
      compartments. Although many endophytic bacteria have the potential to degrade 
      organic pollutants and improve plant growth, their contribution to enhance 
      phytoremediation efficiency is still underestimated. A better knowledge of 
      plant-endophyte interactions could be utilized to increase the remediation of 
      polluted soil environments and to protect the foodstuff by decreasing 
      agrochemical residues in food crops.

AB  - Excessive use of pesticides poses increased risks to non target species including 
      humans. In the developing countries, lack of proper awareness about the toxic 
      potential of pesticides makes the farmer more vulnerable to pesticide linked 
      toxicities, which could lead to diverse pathological conditions. The toxic 
      potential of a pesticide could be determined by their ability to induce genetic 
      mutations and cytotoxicity. Hence, determination of genetic mutation and 
      cytotoxicity of each pesticide is unavoidable to legislate health and safety 
      appraisal about pesticides. The objective of current investigation was to 
      determine the genotoxic and cytotoxic potential of Endosulfan (EN) and 
      Lambda-cyhalothrin (LC); individually and in combination. 
      3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay was 
      utilized to determine cytotoxicity, while two mutant histidine dependent 
      Salmonella strains (TA98, TA100) were used to determine the mutagenicity of EN 
      and LC. Moreover, mutagenicity assay was conducted with and without S9 to 
      evaluate the effects of metabolic activation on mutagenicity. Even though a dose 
      dependent increase in the number of revertant colonies was detected with EN 
      against both bacterial strains, a highly significant (p<0.05) increase in the 
      mutagenicity was detected in TA98 with S9. In comparison, data obtained from LC 
      revealed less mutagenic potential than EN. Surprisingly, the non-mutagenic 
      individual-concentrations of EN and LC showed dose dependent mutagenicity when 
      combined. Combination of EN and LC synergistically induced mutagenicity both in 
      TA98 and TA100. MTT assay spotlighted comparable dose dependent cytotoxicity 
      effects of both pesticides. Interestingly, the combination of EN and LC produced 
      increased reversion and cytotoxicity at lower doses as compared to each 
      pesticide, concluding that pesticide exposure even at sub-lethal doses can 
      produce cytotoxicity and genetic mutations, which could lead to carcinogenicity.

AB  - In this paper, the propagation and scattering of acoustic waves in a flexible 
      wave-guide involving step discontinuity at an interface is considered. The 
      emerging boundary value problem is non-Sturm-Liouville and is solved by employing 
      a hybrid mode-matching technique. The physical scattering process and attenuation 
      of duct modes versus frequency regime and change of height is studied. Moreover, 
      the mode-matching solution is validated through a series of numerical experiments 
      by testifying the power conservation identity and matching interface conditions.

      weight, and body mass index (BMI) in comparison with non-inbred children. 
      METHODS: A cohort study was conducted during April 2013 through July 2013 in 
      Jammu (North India) and a total of 1,270 children (5-15 years of age) were 
      selected in a random way both from inbred and non-inbred families of five Muslim 
      populations. The height and weight was measured using standard methods and the 
      BMI categories were employed as adapted by World Health Organization (WHO). 
      Family pedigrees were drawn to access the family history and children's inbred 
      status in terms of coefficient of inbreeding (F). RESULTS: Children of inbred 
      families showed decline in mean value for height, weight, and BMI (P < 0.0001). 
      The mean difference (95% confidence interval) in height -7.318 (5.827-8.809), 
      weight -6.590 (5.100-8.081) and BMI -2.133 (0.6419-3.624) for inbred as compared 
      with non-inbred children were found to be significant (P < 0.001). We observed an 
      increase in the difference in mean values for height, weight and BMI with the 
      increase of inbreeding coefficient and these were statistically significant 
      (P < 0.05, using post hoc tests). The frequency of underweight children was found 
      to be higher among individuals in the inbred category (<18.5 kg/m(2)  = 47.31%) 
      as compared with the non-inbred category (<18.5 kg/m(2)  = 13.41%) and subsequent 
      depression was found among the inbred children due to an increase of inbreeding 
      coefficient. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the evidence of inbreeding 
      depression on height, weight, and BMI being important in context of child health.

AB  - This study aimed at developing and assessing the fusion proteins with enhanced 
      sensitivity to detect antibodies in plasma as a diagnostic method for 
      tuberculosis. DNA fragments encoding TB16.3 and echA1 gene regions corresponding 
      to proteins TB16.3 and echA1 from Mycobacterium tuberculosis were amplified 
      through PCR. Through a series of restrictions and ligations two novel fusion 
      constructs TB16.3-echA1 and TB16.3-tnPstS1 were produced and expressed in 
      Escherichia coli. These were screened for detection of antibodies in human 
      plasma. The individual antigens TB16.3, echA1 and tnPstS1 and the fusion protein 
      TB16.3-tnPstS1 and TB16.3-echA1 showed sensitivities of 29%, 25.5%, 42.8%, 40.0% 
      and 47.2%, respectively. Lower sensitivity in case of TB16.3-tnPstS1 seems to be 
      due to the structural arrangement between the two proteins, which is likely to 
      mask several of their epitopes. The higher sensitivity of TB16.3-echA1 appears to 
      be due to lesser interaction between the two proteins thus allowing free 
      availability of epitopes for binding antibodies. 64% of TB patients were found 
      positive for either one of the two fusion proteins TB16.3-echA1 and 
      TB16.3-tnPstS1. This study indicates that the novel fusion protein TB16.3-echA1 
      has a potential in serodiagnosis of TB with improved sensitivity and reliability.

TI  - Botanicals, selective insecticides, and predators to control Diaphorina citri 
      (Hemiptera: Liviidae) in citrus orchards.
PG  - 717-26
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12173 [doi]
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri Kuwayama vectors pathogens that 
      cause huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening devastating and economically 
      important disease present in most citrus growing regions. Young citrus shoots are 
      required for psyllid reproduction and development. During winter citrus trees 
      produce little or no new growth. Overwintering adults reproduce in spring on 
      newly emerging shoots also attractive to other pests and beneficial insects. 
      Botanicals and relatively selective insecticides could help to conserve 
      beneficial insects and reduce pest resistance to insecticides. Sprays of 
      Azadirachtin (Neem), Tropane (Datura), Spirotetramat, Spinetoram, and 
      broad-spectrum Imidacloprid were evaluated to control ACP in spring and summer on 
      10-year-old "Kinow" Citrus reticulata Blanco trees producing new growth. Psyllid 
      populations were high averaging 5-9 nymphs or adults per sample before treatment 
      application. Nymphs or adults were significantly reduced to 0.5-1.5 per sample in 
      all treatments for 3 weeks, average 61%-83% reduction. No significant reduction 
      in ladybeetles Adalia bipunctata, Aneglei scardoni, Cheilomenes sexmaculata, and 
      Coccinella septempunctata was observed. Syrphids, spiders and green lacewings 
      were reduced in treated trees except with Tropane. Studies are warranted to 
      assess impact of these predators on ACP and interaction with insecticides. 
      Observed reduction in ACP populations may not be enough considering its 
      reproductive potential and role in the spread of HLB. Follow-up sprays may be 
      required to achieve additional suppression using rotations of different 
      insecticides.

AB  - New copper(II) complex with Schiff base ligand 
      4-[(2-Hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzylidene)-amino]-benzoic acid (H(2)L) was synthesized 
      and characterized by spectroscopic and analytical and single crystal X-ray 
      diffraction studies which revealed that the complex 1 exist in a distorted 
      octahedral environment. In vitro CT-DNA binding studies were performed by 
      employing different biophysical technique which indicated that the 1 strongly 
      binds to DNA in comparison to ligand via electrostatic binding mode. Complex 1 
      cleaves pBR322 DNA via hydrolytic pathway and recognizes minor groove of DNA 
      double helix. The HSA binding results showed that ligand and complex 1 has 
      ability to quench the fluorescence emission intensity of Trp 214 residue 
      available in the subdomain IIA of HSA.

AB  - Thermostable alkaline serine protease gene of Geobacillus stearothermophilus 
      B-1172 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) using pET-22b(+), 
      as an expression vector. The growth conditions were optimized for maximal 
      production of the protease using variable fermentation parameters, i.e., pH, 
      temperature, and addition of an inducer. Protease, thus produced, was purified by 
      ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange chromatography with 
      13.7-fold purification, with specific activity of 97.5 U mg(-1) , and a recovery 
      of 23.6%. Molecular weight of the purified protease, 39 kDa, was determined by 
      sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The enzyme 
      was stable at 90  degrees C at pH 9. The enzyme activity was steady in the presence of 
      EDTA indicating that the protease was not a metalloprotease. No significant 
      change in the activity of protease after addition of various metal ions further 
      strengthened this fact. However, an addition of 1% Triton X-100 or SDS 
      surfactants constrained the enzyme specific activity to 34 and 19%, respectively. 
      Among organic solvents, an addition of 1-butanol (20%) augmented the enzyme 
      activity by 29% of the original activity. With casein as a substrate, the enzyme 
      activity under optimized conditions was found to be 73.8 U mg(-1) . The effect of 
      protease expression on the host cells growth was also studied and found to 
      negatively affect E. coli cells to certain extent. Catalytic domains of serine 
      proteases from eight important thermostable organisms were analyzed through 
      WebLogo and found to be conserved in all serine protease sequences suggesting 
      that protease of G. stearothermophilus could be beneficially used as a biocontrol 
      agent and in many industries including detergent industry.

      quotient (IQ) scores and later mental health problems. Very few epidemiologic 
      studies have been done to demonstrate the relationship between familial 
      inbreeding and modest cognitive impairments in children. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to 
      estimate the effect of inbreeding on children's cognitive behavior in comparison 
      with non-inbred children. METHODOLOGY: A cohort of 408 children (6 to 15 years of 
      age) was selected from inbred and non-inbred families of five Muslim populations 
      of Jammu region. The Wechsler Intelligence Scales for Children (WISC) was used to 
      measure the verbal IQ (VIQ), performance IQ (PIQ) and full scale IQ (FSIQ). 
      Family pedigrees were drawn to access the family history and children's inbred 
      status in terms of coefficient of inbreeding (F). RESULTS: We found significant 
      decline in child cognitive abilities due to inbreeding and high frequency of 
      mental retardation among offspring from inbred families. The mean differences 
      (95% C.I.) were reported for the VIQ, being -22.00 (-24.82, -19.17), PIQ -26.92 
      (-29.96, -23.87) and FSIQ -24.47 (-27.35,-21.59) for inbred as compared to 
      non-inbred children (p<0.001) [corrected].The higher risk of being mentally 
      retarded was found to be more obvious among inbred categories corresponding to 
      the degree of inbreeding and the same accounts least for non-inbred children 
      (p<0.0001). We observed an increase in the difference in mean values for VIQ, PIQ 
      and FSIQ with the increase of inbreeding coefficient and these were found to be 
      statistically significant (p<0.05). The regression analysis showed a fitness 
      decline (depression) for VIQ (R2 = 0.436), PIQ (R2 = 0.468) and FSIQ (R2 = 0.464) 
      with increasing inbreeding coefficients (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our comprehensive 
      assessment provides the evidence for inbreeding depression on cognitive abilities 
      among children.

TI  - The action of peroxyl radicals, powerful deleterious reagents, explains why 
      neither cholesterol nor saturated fatty acids cause atherogenesis and age-related 
      diseases.

AB  - Cells respond to alterations in their membrane structure by activating hydrolytic 
      enzymes. Thus, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are liberated. Free PUFAs 
      react with molecular oxygen to give lipid hydroperoxide molecules (LOOHs). In 
      case of severe cell injury, this physiological reaction switches to the 
      generation of lipid peroxide radicals (LOO(.)). These radicals can attack nearly 
      all biomolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and 
      enzymes, impairing their biological functions. Identical cell responses are 
      triggered by manipulation of food, for example, heating/grilling and particularly 
      homogenization, representing cell injury. Cholesterol as well as diets rich in 
      saturated fat have been postulated to accelerate the risk of atherosclerosis 
      while food rich in unsaturated fatty acids has been claimed to lower this risk. 
      However, the fact is that LOO(.) radicals generated from PUFAs can oxidize 
      cholesterol to toxic cholesterol oxides, simulating a reduction in cholesterol 
      level. In this review it is shown how active LOO(.) radicals interact with 
      biomolecules at a speed transcending usual molecule-molecule reactions by several 
      orders of magnitude. Here, it is explained how functional groups are 
      fundamentally transformed by an attack of LOO(.) with an obliteration of 
      essential biomolecules leading to pathological conditions. A serious 
      reconsideration of the health and diet guidelines is required.

AB  - A comparison of crude curcuminoid extract and purified curcumin was made to 
      evaluate the immunoprotective effect of Curcuma longa (turmeric) Zingiberaceae. 
      Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) induced selective cytolytic effects among immature 
      (PNA(+)) thymocytes and peripheral helper (CD4(+)) T lymphocytes in the spleen 
      were paralleled by a significant reduction in CD25, CD71, and Con A receptor 
      expression. Treatment with curcumanoid crude extract, at two different doses, 
      showed a significant restoration of lymphocyte viability and CD25, CD71, and Con 
      A receptor expression in both immature (PNA+) thymocytes and splenic helper 
      (CD4(+)) T lymphocytes. Turmeric crude extract, at both low and high dose, was 
      found to be more efficient as compared to purified curcumin, suggesting 
      synergistic effect of curcumin with other components of the crude extract.

AB  - A natural predominant flavanone naringenin, especially abundant in citrus fruits, 
      has a wide range of pharmacological activities. The search for antiproliferative 
      agents that reduce skin carcinoma is a task of great importance. The objective of 
      this study was to analyze the anti-proliferative and apoptotic mechanism of 
      naringenin using MTT assay, DNA fragmentation, nuclear condensation, change in 
      mitochondrial membrane potential, cell cycle kinetics and caspase-3 as biomarkers 
      and to investigate the ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) initiating 
      apoptotic cascade in human epidermoid carcinoma A431 cells. Results showed that 
      naringenin exposure significantly reduced the cell viability of A431 cells 
      (p<0.01) with a concomitant increase in nuclear condensation and DNA 
      fragmentation in a dose dependent manner. The intracellular ROS generation assay 
      showed statistically significant (p<0.001) dose-related increment in ROS 
      production for naringenin. It also caused naringenin-mediated epidermoid 
      carcinoma apoptosis by inducing mitochondrial depolarization. Cell cycle study 
      showed that naringenin induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase of cell cycle and 
      caspase-3 analysis revealed a dose dependent increment in caspase-3 activity 
      which led to cell apoptosis. This study confirms the efficacy of naringenin that 
      lead to cell death in epidermoid carcinoma cells via inducing ROS generation, 
      mitochondrial depolarization, nuclear condensation, DNA fragmentation, cell cycle 
      arrest in G0/G1 phase and caspase-3 activation.

AB  - In this study, the regulatory mechanism of the ula (utilization of l-ascorbic 
      acid) operon, putatively responsible for transport and utilization of ascorbic 
      acid in Streptococcus pneumoniae strain D39, is studied. beta-Galactosidase assay 
      data demonstrate that expression of the ula operon is increased in the presence 
      of ascorbic acid as compared with the effects of other sugar sources including 
      glucose. The ula operon consists of nine genes, including a transcriptional 
      regulator UlaR, and is transcribed as a single transcriptional unit. We 
      demonstrate the role of the transcriptional regulator UlaR as a transcriptional 
      activator of the ula operon in the presence of ascorbic acid and show that 
      activation of the ula operon genes by UlaR is CcpA-independent. Furthermore, we 
      predict a 16 bp regulatory site (5'-AACAGTCCGCTGTGTA-3') for UlaR in the promoter 
      region of ulaA. Deletion of the half or full UlaR regulatory site in PulaA 
      confirmed that the UlaR regulatory site present in PulaA is functional.

AB  - Plant-bacteria partnership is a promising strategy for the remediation of soil 
      and water polluted with hydrocarbons. However, the limitation of major nutrients 
      (N, P and K) in soil affects the survival and metabolic activity of plant 
      associated bacteria. The objective of this study was to explore the effects of 
      nutrients on survival and metabolic activity of an alkane degrading 
      rhizo-bacterium. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) was grown in 
      diesel-contaminated soil and inoculated with an alkane degrading bacterium, 
      Pantoea sp. strain BTRH79, in greenhouse experiments. Two levels of nutrients 
      were applied and plant growth, hydrocarbon removal, and gene abundance and 
      expression were determined after 100 days of sowing of ryegrass. Results obtained 
      from these experiments showed that the bacterial inoculation improved plant 
      growth and hydrocarbon degradation and these were further enhanced by nutrients 
      application. Maximum plant biomass production and hydrocarbon mineralization was 
      observed by the combined use of inoculum and higher level of nutrients. The 
      presence of nutrients in soil enhanced the colonization and metabolic activity of 
      the inoculated bacterium in the rhizosphere. The abundance and expression of 
      CYP153 gene in the rhizosphere of ryegrass was found to be directly associated 
      with the level of applied nutrients. Enhanced hydrocarbon degradation was 
      associated with the population of the inoculum bacterium, the abundance and 
      expression of CYP153 gene in the rhizosphere of ryegrass. It is thus concluded 
      that the combination between vegetation, inoculation with pollutant-degrading 
      bacteria and nutrients amendment was an efficient approach to reduce hydrocarbon 
      contamination.

TI  - Potential role of phytohormones and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in 
      abiotic stresses: consequences for changing environment.
PG  - 4907-21
LID - 10.1007/s11356-014-3754-2 [doi]
AB  - Plants are sessile beings, so the need of mechanisms to flee from unfavorable 
      circumstances has provided the development of unique and sophisticated responses 
      to environmental stresses. Depending on the degree of plasticity, many 
      morphological, cellular, anatomical, and physiological changes occur in plants in 
      response to abiotic stress. Phytohormones are small molecules that play critical 
      roles in regulating plant growth and development, as well as stress tolerance to 
      promote survival and acclimatize to varying environments. To congregate the 
      challenges of salinity, temperature extremes, and osmotic stress, plants use 
      their genetic mechanism and different adaptive and biological approaches for 
      survival and high production. In the present attempt, we review the potential 
      role of different phytohormones and plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in 
      abiotic stresses and summarize the research progress in plant responses to 
      abiotic stresses at physiological and molecular levels. We emphasized the 
      regulatory circuits of abscisic acid, indole acetic acid, cytokinins, gibberellic 
      acid, salicylic acid, brassinosteroids, jasmonates, ethylene, and triazole on 
      exposure to abiotic stresses. Current progress is exemplified by the 
      identification and validation of several significant genes that enhanced crop 
      tolerance to stress in the field. These findings will make the modification of 
      hormone biosynthetic pathways for the transgenic plant generation with augmented 
      abiotic stress tolerance and boosting crop productivity in the coming decades 
      possible.

TI  - Epigenetic regulation of human hedgehog interacting protein in glioma cell lines 
      and primary tumor samples.
PG  - 2383-91
LID - 10.1007/s13277-014-2846-4 [doi]
AB  - Glioma constitutes one of the most common groups of brain tumors, and its 
      prognosis is influenced by different genetic and epigenetic modulations. In this 
      study, we demonstrated low or no expression of hedgehog interacting protein 
      (HHIP) in most of the cell lines and primary glioma tumor samples. We further 
      proceeded to promoter methylation study of this gene in the same cell lines and 
      primary tumor samples and found 87 % (7/8) HHIP methylation in glioblastoma cell 
      lines and 75 % (33/44) in primary tumor samples. These methylation pattern 
      correlates with low or unexpressed HHIP in both cell lines and primary tumor 
      samples. Our results suggest the possibility of epigenetic regulation of this 
      gene in glioma, similarly to medulloblastoma, gastric, hepatic, and pancreatic 
      cancers. Also, HHIP might be a diagnostic or prognostic marker in glioma and help 
      to the detection of these tumors in early stages of disease.

TI  - Evaluations of secondary cancer risk in spine radiotherapy using 3DCRT, IMRT, and 
      VMAT: A phantom study.

AB  - This study evaluated the secondary cancer risk from volumetric-modulated arc 
      therapy (VMAT) for spine radiotherapy compared with intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy (IMRT) and 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Computed 
      tomography images of an Radiological Physics Center spine anthropomorphic phantom 
      were exported to a treatment planning system (Pinnacle(3), version 9.4). 
      Radiation treatment plans for spine were prepared using VMAT (dual-arc), 7-field 
      IMRT (beam angles: 110 degrees , 130 degrees , 150 degrees , 180 degrees , 210 degrees , 230 degrees , and 250 degrees ), and 4-field 
      3DCRT technique. The mean and maximum doses, dose-volume histograms, and volumes 
      receiving more than 2 and 4Gy to organs at risk (OARs) were calculated and 
      compared. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to the 
      National Cancer Registry Programme Report 116. VMAT delivered the lowest maximum 
      dose to the esophagus (4.03Gy), bone (8.11Gy), heart (2.11Gy), spinal cord 
      (6.45Gy), and whole lung (5.66Gy) as compared with other techniques (IMRT and 
      3DCRT). The volumes of OAR (esophagus) receiving more than 4Gy were 0% for VMAT, 
      27.06% for IMRT, and up to 32.35% for 3DCRT. The estimated risk for secondary 
      cancer in the respective OAR is considerably lower in VMAT compared with other 
      techniques. The results of maximum doses and volumes of OARs suggest that the 
      risk of secondary cancer induction for the spine in VMAT is lower than IMRT and 
      3DCRT, whereas VMAT has the best target coverage compared with the other 
      techniques.

TI  - A comparative study of fatty acid profile and formation of biofilm in Geobacillus 
      gargensis exposed to variable abiotic stress.
PG  - 48-59
LID - 10.1139/cjm-2014-0615 [doi]
AB  - Understanding bacterial fatty acid (FA) profile has a great taxonomic 
      significance as well as clinical importance for diagnosis issues. Both the 
      composition and nature of membrane FAs change under different nutritional, biotic 
      and (or) abiotic stresses, and environmental stress. Bacteria produce both 
      odd-carbon as well as branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs). This study was designed 
      to examine the effect of abiotic pressure, including salinity, temperature, pH, 
      and oxinic stress on the growth, development, and FA profile in thermophilic 
      Geobacillus gargensis. Under these stresses, 3 parametric ratios, 2-methyl fatty 
      acids/3-methyl fatty acids (iso-/anteiso-FAs), BCFAs/straight-chain saturated 
      fatty acids (SCSFA), and SCSFAs/straight-chain unsaturated fatty acids (SCUFA), 
      in addition to total lipids affected by variable stresses were measured. Our 
      results indicate that the ratio of total iso-/anteiso-FAs increased at the acidic 
      pH range of 4.1-5.2 and decreased with increasing pH. The reverse was true for 
      salt stress when iso-/anteiso-FAs ratio increased with salt concentration. The 
      BCFAs/SCSFAs and SCSFAs/SCUFAs ratios increased at neutral and alkaline pH and 
      high salt concentration, reduced incubation time, and comparatively high 
      temperature (55-65  degrees C) of the growth medium. The bacterial total lipid percentage 
      deceased with increasing salt concentration, incubation period, but it increased 
      with temperature. The formation of extracellular polymeric substances was 
      observed under all stress conditions and with the addition of sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate (2 and 5 mmol/L) to the growth medium. The membrane phospholipid 
      composition of the bacterium was analyzed by thin-layer chromatography.

AB  - New pharmacophore organoselenium compound (1) was designed, synthesized and 
      characterized by various spectroscopic methods (IR, ESI-MS, (1)H, (13)C and 
      (77)Se NMR) and further confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Compound 1 consists 
      of two 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl units which are connected to the selenium 
      atom via the organometallic C-Se bond. In vitro DNA binding studies of 1 was 
      investigated by absorption and emission titration methods which revealed that 1 
      recognizes the minor groove of DNA in accordance with molecular docking studies 
      with the DNA duplex. Gel electrophoretic assay demonstrates the ability of 1 to 
      cleave pBR322 DNA through hydrolytic process which was further validated by T4 
      religation assay. To understand the drug-protein interaction of which ultimate 
      molecular target was DNA, the affinity of 1 towards HSA was also investigated by 
      the spectroscopic and molecular modeling techniques which showed hydrophobic 
      interaction in the subdomain IIA of HSA. Furthermore, the intracellular 
      localization of 1 was evidenced by cell imaging studies using HeLa cells.

AB  - With advanced technologies in hand, there exist potential applications and 
      services built around monitoring activities of daily living (ADL) of elderly 
      people at nursing homes. Most of the elderly people in these facilities are 
      suffering from different chronic diseases such as dementia. Existing technologies 
      are mainly focusing on non-medication interventions and monitoring of ADL for 
      addressing loss of autonomy or well-being. Monitoring and managing ADL related to 
      cognitive behaviors for non-medication intervention are very effective in 
      improving dementia patients' conditions. However, cognitive functions of patients 
      can be improved if appropriate recommendations of medications are delivered at a 
      particular time. Previously we developed the Secured Wireless Sensor Network 
      Integrated Cloud Computing for Ubiquitous-Life Care (SC(3)). SC(3) services were 
      limited to monitoring ADL of elderly people with Alzheimer's disease and 
      providing non-medication recommendations to the patient. In this article, we 
      propose a system called the Smart Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) as an 
      integral part of the SC(3) platform. Using the Smart CDSS, patients are provided 
      with access to medication recommendations of expert physicians. Physicians are 
      provided with an interface to create clinical knowledge for medication 
      recommendations and to observe the patient's condition. The clinical knowledge 
      created by physicians as the knowledge base of the Smart CDSS produces 
      recommendations to the caregiver for medications based on each patient's 
      symptoms.

AB  - To evaluate the biological preference of chiral drugs toward DNA target, new 
      metal-based chemotherapeutic agents of Cu(II) and Zn(II), 
      l-/d-fluorobenzothiazole Schiff base-valine complexes 1 &2 (a and b), 
      respectively were synthesized and thoroughly characterized. Preliminary in vitro 
      DNA binding studies of ligand L and complexes 1 &2 (a and b) were carried out in 
      Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.2 to demonstrate the chiral preference of l-enantiomeric 
      complexes over the d-analogues. The extent of DNA binding propensity was 
      ascertained quantitatively by Kb, K and Ksv values which revealed greater binding 
      propensity by l-enantiomeric Cu(II) complex 1a and its potency to act as a 
      chemotherapeutic agent. The cleavage studies with pBR322 plasmid DNA revealed 
      higher nuclease activity of 1a as compared to 2avia hydrolytic cleavage 
      mechanism. The complexes 1 &2 (a and b) were also screened for antimicrobial 
      activity which demonstrated significantly good activity for l-enantiomeric 
      complexes. Furthermore, cytotoxicity of the complexes 1a and 1b was evaluated by 
      the MTT assay on human HeLa cancer cell line which implicated that more than 50% 
      cells were viable at 15muM. These results were further validated by cell imaging 
      studies which demonstrated the nuclear blebbing.

AB  - Prosopis juliflora is characterized by distinct and profuse growth even in 
      nutritionally poor soil and environmentally stressed conditions and is believed 
      to harbor some novel heavy metal-resistant bacteria in the rhizosphere and 
      endosphere. This study was performed to isolate and characterize Cr-resistant 
      bacteria from the rhizosphere and endosphere of P. juliflora growing on the 
      tannery effluent contaminated soil. A total of 5 and 21 bacterial strains were 
      isolated from the rhizosphere and endosphere, respectively, and were shown to 
      tolerate Cr up to 3000 mg l(-1). These isolates also exhibited tolerance to other 
      toxic heavy metals such as, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn, and high concentration (174 g 
      l(-1)) of NaCl. Moreover, most of the isolated bacterial strains showed one or 
      more plant growth-promoting activities. The phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA 
      gene showed that the predominant species included Bacillus, Staphylococcus and 
      Aerococcus. As far as we know, this is the first report analyzing rhizo- and 
      endophytic bacterial communities associated with P. juliflora growing on the 
      tannery effluent contaminated soil. The inoculation of three isolates to ryegrass 
      (Lolium multiflorum L.) improved plant growth and heavy metal removal from the 
      tannery effluent contaminated soil suggesting that these bacteria could enhance 
      the establishment of the plant in contaminated soil and also improve the 
      efficiency of phytoremediation of heavy metal-degraded soils.

AB  - Different grasses and trees were tested for their growth in a crude oil 
      contaminated soil. Three grasses, Lolium perenne, Leptochloa fusca, Brachiaria 
      mutica, and two trees, Lecucaena leucocephala and Acacia ampliceps, were selected 
      to investigate the diversity of hydrocarbon-degrading rhizospheric and endophytic 
      bacteria. We found a higher number of hydrocarbon degrading bacteria associated 
      with grasses than trees and that the endophytic bacteria were taxonomically 
      different from rhizosphere associated bacteria showing their spatial distribution 
      with reference to plant compartment as well as genotype. The rhizospheric soil 
      yielded 22 (59.45 %), root interior yielded 9 (24.32 %) and shoot interior 
      yielded 6 (16.21 %) hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. These bacteria possessed 
      genes encoding alkane hydroxylase and showed multiple plant growth-promoting 
      activities. Bacillus (48.64 %) and Acinetobacter (18.91 %) were dominant genera 
      found in this study. At 2 % crude oil concentration, all bacterial isolates 
      exhibited 25 %-78 % oil degradation and Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56 degraded 
      maximum. Our study suggests that for practical application, support of potential 
      bacteria combined with the grasses is more effective approach than trees to 
      remediate oil contaminated soils.

TI  - Green tea extract therapy diminishes hepatic fibrosis mediated by dual exposure 
      to carbon tetrachloride and ethanol: A histopathological study.
PG  - 787-794
AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the hepatoprotective effect of 
      green tea extract (GTE) against the hepatic fibrosis induced by carbon 
      tetrachloride (CCl(4)), ethanol, and dual exposure to CCl(4) plus ethanol in 
      rats. In particular, an investigation of the three-dimensional architecture was 
      conducted using scanning electron microscopy. Various techniques revealed that 
      hepatic fibrosis with intermingled fibers was located between cells in the 
      CCl(4), ethanol and combined CCl(4) plus ethanol groups. The hepatic fibrosis 
      differed among the ethanol, CCl(4) and CCl(4) plus ethanol groups in terms of the 
      type, thickness and distribution of fibers. The fibrotic lesions virtually 
      disappeared in all the groups after 25 days of treatment with GTE, returning the 
      architecture of the liver tissue to its normal status. The rats were also found 
      to regain normal body weight and fur color, which had earlier been discolored due 
      to weight loss. The autopsy results also showed that the animal livers returned 
      to the normal shape and color. GTE demonstrated the same clear action in 
      attenuating the hepatofibrosis for all three inducing treatments, by impairing 
      collagen fibers, eliminating lipid peroxidation and returning the liver 
      architecture to normal. GTE presents a safe therapeutic strategy for hepatic 
      fibrosis.

AB  - In this study, we have explored the impact of ascorbic acid on the transcriptome 
      of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39. The expression of several genes and operons, 
      including the ula operon (which has been previously shown to be involved in 
      ascorbic acid utilization), the AdcR regulon (which has been previously shown to 
      be involved in zinc transport and virulence) and a PTS operon (which we denote 
      here as ula2 operon) were altered in the presence of ascorbic acid. The ula2 
      operon consists of five genes, including the transcriptional activator ulaR2. Our 
      beta-galactosidase assay data and transcriptome comparison of the ulaR2 mutant with 
      the wild-type demonstrated that the transcriptional activator UlaR2 in the 
      presence of ascorbic acid activates the expression of the ula2 operon. We further 
      predict a 16-bp regulatory site (5'-ATATTGTGCTCAAATA-3') for UlaR2 in the Pula2. 
      Furthermore, we have explored the effect of ascorbic acid on the expression of 
      the AdcR regulon. Our ICP-MS analysis showed that addition of ascorbic acid to 
      the medium causes zinc starvation in the cell which leads to the activation of 
      the AdcR regulon.

TI  - Sialic acid-mediated gene expression in Streptococcus pneumoniae and role of NanR 
      as a transcriptional activator of the nan gene cluster.
PG  - 3121-31
LID - 10.1128/AEM.00499-15 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic response of Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae D39 to sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid [Neu5Ac]). Transcriptome 
      comparison of wild-type D39 grown in M17 medium with and without sialic acid 
      revealed the elevated expression of various genes and operons, including the nan 
      gene cluster (nan operon I and nanA gene). Our microarray analysis and 
      promoter-lacZ fusion studies showed that the transcriptional regulator NanR acts 
      as a transcriptional activator of nan operon I and the nanA gene in the presence 
      of sialic acid. The putative regulatory site of NanR in the promoter region of 
      nan operon I is predicted and confirmed by promoter truncation experiments. 
      Furthermore, the role of CcpA in the regulation of the nan gene cluster is 
      demonstrated through microarray analysis and promoter-lacZ fusion studies, 
      suggesting that in the presence of sialic acid and glucose, CcpA represses the 
      expression of nan operon I while the expression of the nanA gene is CcpA 
      independent.

AB  - Fragile-X syndrome (FXS) is the most common form of inherited intellectual 
      disability (ID) and affects 0.7-3.0% of intellectually compromised population of 
      unknown etiology worldwide. It is mostly caused by repeat expansion mutations in 
      the FMR1 at chromosome Xq27.3. The present study aimed to develop molecular 
      diagnostic tools for a better detection of FXS, to assess implementation of 
      diagnostic protocols in a developing country and to estimate the prevalence of 
      FXS in a cohort of intellectually disabled subjects from Pakistan. From a large 
      pool of individuals with below normal IQ range, 395 subjects with intellectual 
      disability of unknown etiology belonging to different regions of the country were 
      recruited. Conventional-PCR, modified-PCR and Southern blot analysis methods were 
      employed for the detection of CGG repeat polymorphisms in the FMR1 gene. Initial 
      screening with conventional-PCR identified 13 suspected patients. Subsequent 
      investigations through modified PCR and Southern blot analyses confirmed the 
      presence of the FMR1 mutation, suggesting a prevalence of 3.5% and 2.8% (mean 
      3.3%) among the male and female ID patients, respectively. These diagnostic 
      methods were further customized with the in-house conditions to offer robust 
      screening of referral patients/families for diagnostics and genetic counseling. 
      Prescreening and early diagnosis are crucial for designing a prudent strategy for 
      the management of subjects with ID. Outcome of the study recommends health 
      practitioners for implementation of molecular based FXS diagnosis in routine 
      clinical practice to give a better care for patients similar to the ones included 
      in the study.

TI  - A Fast and Reliable Pipeline for Bacterial Transcriptome Analysis Case study: 
      Serine-dependent Gene Regulation in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
LID - 10.3791/52649 [doi]
LID - 52649
AB  - Gene expression and its regulation are very important to understand the behavior 
      of cells under different conditions. Various techniques are used nowadays to 
      study gene expression, but most are limited in terms of providing an overall 
      picture of the expression of the whole transcriptome. DNA microarrays offer a 
      fast and economic research technology, which gives a full overview of global gene 
      expression and have a vast number of applications including identification of 
      novel genes and transcription factor binding sites, characterization of 
      transcriptional activity of the cells and also help in analyzing thousands of 
      genes (in a single experiment). In the present study, the conditions for 
      bacterial transcriptome analysis from cell harvest to DNA microarray analysis 
      have been optimized. Taking into account the time, costs and accuracy of the 
      experiments, this technology platform proves to be very useful and universally 
      applicabale for studying bacterial transcriptomes. Here, we perform DNA 
      microarray analysis with Streptococcus pneumoniae as a case-study by comparing 
      the transcriptional responses of S. pneumoniae grown in the presence of varying 
      L-serine concentrations in the medium. Total RNA was isolated by using a Macaloid 
      method using an RNA isolation kit and the quality of RNA was checked by using an 
      RNA quality check kit. cDNA was prepared using reverse transcriptase and the cDNA 
      samples were labelled using one of two amine-reactive fluorescent dyes. Homemade 
      DNA microarray slides were used for hybridization of the labelled cDNA samples 
      and microarray data were analyzed by using a cDNA microarray data pre-processing 
      framework (Microprep). Finally, Cyber-T was used to analyze the data generated 
      using Microprep for the identification of statistically significant 
      differentially expressed genes. Furthermore, in-house built software packages 
      (PePPER, FIVA, DISCLOSE, PROSECUTOR, Genome2D) were used to analyze data.

      being used in many integrated pest management (IPM) programs to control insect 
      pests. The effect of post-treatment temperature on insecticide toxicity of a 
      spinosyn (spinosad), pyrethroid (lambda cyhalothrin), organophosphate 
      (chlorpyrifos) and new chemistry (acetamiprid) to C. carnea larvae was 
      investigated under laboratory conditions. Temperature coefficients of each 
      insecticide tested were evaluated. From 20 to 40  degrees C, toxicity of lambda 
      cyhalothrin and spinosad decreased by 2.15- and 1.87-fold while toxicity of 
      acetamiprid and chlorpyrifos increased by 2.00 and 1.79-fold, respectively. The 
      study demonstrates that pesticide effectiveness may vary according to 
      environmental conditions. In cropping systems where multiple insecticide products 
      are used, attention should be given to temperature variation as a key factor in 
      making pest management strategies safer for biological control agents. 
      Insecticides with a negative temperature coefficient may play a constructive role 
      to conserve C. carnea populations.

TI  - Prevalence and Genetic Analysis of Bitter Taste Perception for 
      Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) Among Some Muslim Populations of Uttar Pradesh, India.
PG  - 441-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The ability to taste Phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), a bitter organic 
      compound, described as a bimodal autosomal trait is widely used to know the 
      heritable trait in both genetic and anthropological studies. The present study 
      was carried out to analyze the prevalence of PTC taste sensitivity and to 
      determine the gene frequencies among some Muslim populations of Uttar Pradesh, 
      India. This study has some physiological relevance to highlight the adaptability 
      of endogamous groups to behavioral traits in the same place. METHODS: Unrelated, 
      healthy individuals of both sexes (Male-403, Female-418) belonging to different 
      populations of Uttar Pradesh, India were randomly selected with the age range of 
      16-45 years observed for phenylthiocarbamide to taste sensitivity. PTC tasting 
      ability was measured by using a serial dilution method of Harris and Kalmus. 
      RESULTS: The phenotypic frequency of tasters was higher as compared to 
      non-tasters, and the same is statistically significant (chi(2)= 11.92, df = 5, P = 
      0.036). There were more females among tasters (67.94%) than males (64.76%). This 
      observation was statistically significant (chi(2) = 14.79, df = 5, P = 0.011). 
      CONCLUSION: The frequency of PTC tasters is greater than non-tasters and the 
      females have lower non-taster pheno-types as compared to males. This type of 
      study will provide background information about genetic structure of population 
      and serves as useful interaction of genetics, food preferences and dietary 
      patterns.

TI  - Choice of the pulse sequence and parameters for improved signal-to-noise ratio in 
      T1-weighted study of MRI.
PG  - 512-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the practical impact of alteration of imaging 
      parameters on signal-to-noise ratio for the most commonly used T1-weighted 
      magnetic resonance sequences. METHODS: The study was conducted in the Department 
      of Medical Physics, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, UK, in 2007. 
      Magnetic resonance images of a tissue-equivalent material were generated with a 
      set of T1 and T2 values. Experimental variations in the imaging parameters were 
      performed in echo time and repetition time. Quantitative analysis consisted of 
      signal-to-noise ratio. RESULTS: Percentage inaccuracy in signal-to-noise ratio 
      was the result of inappropriate choice of parameters. We have investigated 
      conventional spin echo, fast spin echo and fast fluid attenuated inversion 
      recovery with one of corresponding percentage errors 28.68%, -36.65% and -40.34%, 
      respectively. Conventional spin echo presented moderately low percentage error 
      with the choice of repetition time and echo time. Factual error in fast spin echo 
      was slightly higher than conventional spin echo. Fast fluid attenuated inversion 
      recovery could create outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of high T1/T2 value 
      phantoms in T1-weighted images. CONCLUSIONS: The role of repetition time and echo 
      time in T1-weighted images was crucial to sustain the image quality.

TI  - Maltose-Dependent Transcriptional Regulation of the mal Regulon by MalR in 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae.

AB  - The maltose regulon (mal regulon) has previously been shown to consist of the mal 
      gene cluster (malMP, malXCD and malAR operons) in Streptococcus pneumoniae. In 
      this study, we have further elucidated the complete mal regulon in S. pneumoniae 
      D39 using microarray analyses and beta-galactosidase assays. In addition to the mal 
      gene cluster, the complete mal regulon of S. pneumoniae D39 consists of a 
      pullulanase (PulA), a glucosidase (DexB), a glucokinase (RokB), a PTS component 
      (PtsG) and an amylase (AmyA2). Our microarray studies and beta-galactosidase assays 
      further showed that the LacI-family transcriptional regulator MalR represses the 
      expression of the mal regulon in the absence of maltose. Furthermore, the role of 
      the pleiotropic transcriptional regulator CcpA in the regulation of the mal 
      regulon in the presence of maltose was explored. Our microarray analysis with a 
      DeltaccpA strain showed that CcpA only represses the expression of the malXCD operon 
      and the pulA gene in the presence of maltose. Hence, we extend the mal regulon 
      now consisting of pulA, dexB, rokB, ptsG and amyA2 in addition to malMP, malXCD 
      and malAR operons.

      serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB  - Serodiagnosis of tuberculosis requires detection of antibodies against multiple 
      antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, because antibody profiles differ among 
      the patients. Using fusion proteins with epitopes from two or more antigens would 
      facilitate in the detection of multiple antibodies. Fusion constructs 
      tn1FbpC1-tnPstS1 and tn2FbpC1-tnPstS1 were produced by linking truncated regions 
      of variable lengths from FbpC1 to the N-terminus of the truncated PstS1. 
      Similarly a truncated fragment of HSP was linked to the N-terminus of a truncated 
      fragment from FbpC1 to produce tnHSP-tn1FbpC1. ELISA analysis of the plasma 
      samples of TB patients against tn2FbpC1-tnPstS1 showed 72.2% sensitivity which is 
      nearly the same as the expected combined value for the two individual antigens. 
      However, the sensitivity of tn1FbpC1-tnPstS1 was lowered to 60%. tnHSP-tn1FbpC1 
      showed 67.7% sensitivity which is slightly less than the expected combined value 
      for the two individual antigens, but still significantly higher than that of each 
      of the individual antigen. Data for secondary structure analysis by CD 
      spectrometry was in reasonable agreement with the X-ray crystallographic data of 
      the native proteins and the predicted structure of the fusion proteins. 
      Comparative molecular modeling suggests that the epitopes of the constituent 
      proteins are better exposed in tn2FbpC1-tnPstS1 as compared to those in 
      tn1FbpC1-tnPstS1. Therefore, removal of the N-terminal non-epitopic region of 
      FbpC1 from 34-96 amino acids seems to have unmasked at least some of the 
      epitopes, resulting in greater sensitivity. The high level of sensitivity of 
      tn2FbpC1-tnPstS1 and tnHSP-tn1FbpC1, not reported before, shows that these fusion 
      proteins have great potential for use in serodiagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB  - High toxicity, bioaccumulation factor and widespread dispersal of persistent 
      organic pollutants (POPs) cause environmental and human health hazards. The 
      combined use of plants and bacteria is a promising approach for the remediation 
      of soil and water contaminated with POPs. Plants provide residency and nutrients 
      to their associated rhizosphere and endophytic bacteria. In return, the bacteria 
      support plant growth by the degradation and detoxification of POPs. Moreover, 
      they improve plant growth and health due to their innate plant growth-promoting 
      mechanisms. This review provides a critical view of factors that affect 
      absorption and translocation of POPs in plants and the limitations that plant 
      have to deal with during the remediation of POPs. Moreover, the synergistic 
      effects of plant-bacteria interactions in the phytoremediation of organic 
      pollutants with special reference to POPs are discussed.

LID - 10.1159/000377724 [doi]
AB  - In this study, we explore the impact of fucose on the transcriptome of S. 
      pneumoniae D39. The expression of various genes and operons, including the fucose 
      uptake PTS and utilization operon (fcs operon) was altered in the presence of 
      fucose. By means of quantitative RT-PCR and beta-galactosidase analysis, we 
      demonstrate the role of the transcriptional regulator FcsR, present upstream of 
      the fcs operon, as a transcriptional activator of the fcs operon. We also predict 
      a 19-bp putative FcsR regulatory site (5'-ATTTGAACATTATTCAAGT-3') in the promoter 
      region of the fcs operon. The functionality of this predicted FcsR regulatory 
      site was further confirmed by promoter-truncation experiments, where deletion of 
      half of the FscR regulatory site or full deletion led to the abolition of 
      expression of the fcs operon.

PG  - 151-61
LID - 10.1007/s10787-015-0236-1 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing body of evidence that plant polyphenols such as resveratrol, 
      anthocyanins, catechins, and terpenes like taxol are effectively used in the 
      treatment of chronic conditions including cancer, Alzheimer, Parkinsonism, 
      diabetes, aging, etc. The link between oxidative stress and inflammation is well 
      accepted. Thus, the mechanism of action of these natural products is partly 
      believed to be through their significant antioxidant properties. The main 
      constituent of green tea, with clinical significance, is epigallocatechin gallate 
      (EGCG). It has been associated with antitumor, anti-Alzheimer, and anti-aging 
      properties, improve redox status at the tissue level possibly preventing system 
      level structural damage. This review focuses on EGCG and its potential 
      therapeutic role in health and disease.

AB  - For effective remediation of contaminants, plant-endophyte partnership is a 
      promising field to be explored. Generally endophytic bacteria assist their host 
      plant by withstanding the stress induced by the contaminants. The objective of 
      this study was to explore the suitability of plant-bacterial partnership for 
      chlorpyrifos (CP) remediation using ryegrass and a CP degrading endophyte, 
      Mesorhizobium sp. HN3 which belongs to plant growth promoting rhizobia. The 
      inoculated yfp-tagged Mesorhizobium sp. HN3 efficiently colonized in the 
      rhizosphere, enhanced plant growth and degradation of CP and its metabolite 3,5,6 
      trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCP). Significantly lower CP residues were observed in the 
      roots and shoots of plants vegetated in inoculated soil which might be attributed 
      to the efficient root colonization of HN3yfp. These results suggest the 
      involvement of Mesorhizobium sp. HN3yfp in CP degradation inside the roots and 
      rhizosphere of plants and further emphasize on the effectiveness of endophytic 
      bacteria in stimulating the remediation of pesticide contaminants. This is the 
      first report which demonstrates the efficacy of bacterial endophyte for 
      degradation of CP residues taken up by the plant and enhanced remediation of 
      chlorpyrifos contaminated soil.

TI  - Knowledge-Based Query Construction Using the CDSS Knowledge Base for Efficient 
      Evidence Retrieval.
PG  - 21294-314
LID - 10.3390/s150921294 [doi]
AB  - Finding appropriate evidence to support clinical practices is always challenging, 
      and the construction of a query to retrieve such evidence is a fundamental step. 
      Typically, evidence is found using manual or semi-automatic methods, which are 
      time-consuming and sometimes make it difficult to construct knowledge-based 
      complex queries. To overcome the difficulty in constructing knowledge-based 
      complex queries, we utilized the knowledge base (KB) of the clinical decision 
      support system (CDSS), which has the potential to provide sufficient contextual 
      information. To automatically construct knowledge-based complex queries, we 
      designed methods to parse rule structure in KB of CDSS in order to determine an 
      executable path and extract the terms by parsing the control structures and logic 
      connectives used in the logic. The automatically constructed knowledge-based 
      complex queries were executed on the PubMed search service to evaluate the 
      results on the reduction of retrieved citations with high relevance. The average 
      number of citations was reduced from 56,249 citations to 330 citations with the 
      knowledge-based query construction approach, and relevance increased from 1 term 
      to 6 terms on average. The ability to automatically retrieve relevant evidence 
      maximizes efficiency for clinicians in terms of time, based on feedback collected 
      from clinicians. This approach is generally useful in evidence-based medicine, 
      especially in ambient assisted living environments where automation is highly 
      important.

      streptokinase in public sector hospitals.
PG  - 821-6
LID - 10.12669/pjms.314.6803 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the psychosocial risk factors of myocardial 
      infarction and time related adverse effects of administration of streptokinase on 
      short-term morbidity and mortality in patients with ST-segment-elevation 
      myocardial infarction (STEMI). METHODS: One hundred patients with STEMI treated 
      with streptokinase in the hospital setting were prospectively enrolled in the 
      study. The primary outcome parameter was the incidence of major adverse cardiac 
      events. During hospital stay the psychosocial and demographic risk factors were 
      also investigated. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was similar in both groups 
      and it was not significant. (5.7% vs 14.5%; P = 0.18). The number of recurrent 
      chest pain was significantly higher in the group 2 compared to the group 1 (25% 
      vs 62.5%; P = .01). The number of hypotesion was significantly higher in the 
      group 1 as compared to the group 2 (30.7% vs 6.2%; P = .009). The demographic and 
      psychosocial risk factors were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The early intravenous 
      administration of streptokinase in the hospital setting leads to a reduced rate 
      of major cardiovascular events compared to delayed administration beyond 2 hours. 
      However, mortality rates were not significantly affected. Secondary prevention 
      should be targeted on modifiable demographic, dietary, and psychosocial risk 
      factors of STEMI.

TI  - Transcriptional profiling of UlaR-regulated genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
PG  - 57-9
LID - 10.1016/j.gdata.2015.02.004 [doi]
AB  - The transcriptional regulator UlaR belongs to the family of PRD-containing 
      transcriptional regulators, which are mostly involved in the regulation of 
      carbohydrate metabolism. The role of the transcriptional regulator UlaR in 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae has recently been described [1]. Here, we report 
      detailed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of UlaR-regulated genes in S. 
      pneumoniae D39 and its ∆ulaR derivative, either in the presence of 10 mM ascorbic 
      acid in M17 medium using microarray analysis. 10 mM concentration of ascorbic 
      acid was supplemented to the M17 medium because our lacZ-fusion studies indicated 
      that UlaR acts as a transcriptional activator of its targets in the presence of 
      ascorbic acid and the expression of the ula operon was maximal at a 10 mM 
      ascorbic acid concentration [1]. All transcriptional profiling data of 
      UlaR-regulated genes was deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
      under accession number GSE61649.

AB  - We explored the regulatory mechanism of Leloir pathway genes in Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae D39. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of galKT is galactose 
      dependent. By microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR, we further show the 
      role of the transcriptional regulator GalR, present upstream of galKT, as a 
      transcriptional activator of galKT in the presence of galactose. Moreover, we 
      predict a 19-bp regulatory site (5'-GATAGTTTAGTAAAATTTT-3') for the 
      transcriptional regulator GalR in the promoter region of galK, which is also 
      highly conserved in other streptococci. Growth comparison of D39 DeltagalK with the 
      D39 wild type grown in the presence of galactose shows that galK is required for 
      the proper growth of S. pneumoniae on galactose.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to help a team of physicians and 
      knowledge engineers acquire clinical knowledge from existing practices datasets 
      for treatment of head and neck cancer, to validate the knowledge against 
      published guidelines, to create refined rules, and to incorporate these rules 
      into clinical workflow for clinical decision support. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A 
      team of physicians (clinical domain experts) and knowledge engineers adapt an 
      approach for modeling existing treatment practices into final executable clinical 
      models. For initial work, the oral cavity is selected as the candidate target 
      area for the creation of rules covering a treatment plan for cancer. The final 
      executable model is presented in HL7 Arden Syntax, which helps the clinical 
      knowledge be shared among organizations. We use a data-driven knowledge 
      acquisition approach based on analysis of real patient datasets to generate a 
      predictive model (PM). The PM is converted into a refined-clinical knowledge 
      model (R-CKM), which follows a rigorous validation process. The validation 
      process uses a clinical knowledge model (CKM), which provides the basis for 
      defining underlying validation criteria. The R-CKM is converted into a set of 
      medical logic modules (MLMs) and is evaluated using real patient data from a 
      hospital information system. RESULTS: We selected the oral cavity as the intended 
      site for derivation of all related clinical rules for possible associated 
      treatment plans. A team of physicians analyzed the National Comprehensive Cancer 
      Network (NCCN) guidelines for the oral cavity and created a common CKM. Among the 
      decision tree algorithms, chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) was 
      applied to a refined dataset of 1229 patients to generate the PM. The PM was 
      tested on a disjoint dataset of 739 patients, which gives 59.0% accuracy. Using a 
      rigorous validation process, the R-CKM was created from the PM as the final 
      model, after conforming to the CKM. The R-CKM was converted into four candidate 
      MLMs, and was used to evaluate real data from 739 patients, yielding efficient 
      performance with 53.0% accuracy. CONCLUSION: Data-driven knowledge acquisition 
      and validation against published guidelines were used to help a team of 
      physicians and knowledge engineers create executable clinical knowledge. The 
      advantages of the R-CKM are twofold: it reflects real practices and conforms to 
      standard guidelines, while providing optimal accuracy comparable to that of a PM. 
      The proposed approach yields better insight into the steps of knowledge 
      acquisition and enhances collaboration efforts of the team of physicians and 
      knowledge engineers.

TI  - Plant species affect colonization patterns and metabolic activity of associated 
      endophytes during phytoremediation of crude oil-contaminated soil.
PG  - 6188-96

AB  - Plants coupled with endophytic bacteria hold great potential for the remediation 
      of polluted environment. The colonization patterns and activity of inoculated 
      endophytes in rhizosphere and endosphere of host plant are among the primary 
      factors that may influence the phytoremediation process. However, these 
      colonization patterns and metabolic activity of the inoculated endophytes are in 
      turn controlled by none other than the host plant itself. The present study aims 
      to determine such an interaction specifically for plant-endophyte systems 
      remediating crude oil-contaminated soil. A consortium (AP) of two oil-degrading 
      endophytic bacteria (Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      strain BRRI54) was inoculated to two grasses, Brachiaria mutica and Leptochloa 
      fusca, vegetated in crude oil-contaminated soil. Colonization patterns and 
      metabolic activity of the endophytes were monitored in the rhizosphere and 
      endosphere of the plants. Bacterial augmentation enhanced plant growth and crude 
      oil degradation. Maximum crude oil degradation (78%) was achieved with B. mutica 
      plants inoculated with AP consortium. This degradation was significantly higher 
      than those treatments, where plants and bacteria were used individually or L. 
      fusca and endophytes were used in combination. Moreover, colonization and 
      metabolic activity of the endophytes were higher in the rhizosphere and 
      endosphere of B. mutica than L. fusca. The plant species affected not only 
      colonization pattern and biofilm formation of the inoculated bacteria in the 
      rhizosphere and endosphere of the host plant but also affected the expression of 
      alkane hydroxylase gene, alkB. Hence, the investigation revealed that plant 
      species can affect colonization patterns and metabolic activity of inoculated 
      endophytic bacteria and ultimately the phytoremediation process.

AB  - By using a transcriptomic approach, we have elucidated the effect of Ni(2+) on 
      the global gene expression of S. pneumoniae D39 by identifying several 
      differentially expressed genes/operons in the presence of a high extracellular 
      concentration of Ni(2+). The genes belonging to the AdcR regulon (adcRCBA, 
      adcAII-phtD, phtA, phtB, and phtE) and the PsaR regulon (pcpA, prtA, and psaBCA) 
      were highly upregulated in the presence of Ni(2+). We have further studied the 
      role of Ni(2+) in the regulation of the AdcR regulon by using ICP-MS analysis, 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transcriptional lacZ-reporter studies, 
      and demonstrate that Ni(2+) is directly involved in the derepression of the AdcR 
      regulon via the Zn(2+)-dependent repressor AdcR, and has an opposite effect on 
      the expression of the AdcR regulon compared to Zn(2+).

AB  - A wellness system provides wellbeing recommendations to support experts in 
      promoting a healthier lifestyle and inducing individuals to adopt healthy habits. 
      Adopting physical activity effectively promotes a healthier lifestyle. A physical 
      activity recommendation system assists users to adopt daily routines to form a 
      best practice of life by involving themselves in healthy physical activities. 
      Traditional physical activity recommendation systems focus on general 
      recommendations applicable to a community of users rather than specific 
      individuals. These recommendations are general in nature and are fit for the 
      community at a certain level, but they are not relevant to every individual based 
      on specific requirements and personal interests. To cover this aspect, we propose 
      a multimodal hybrid reasoning methodology (HRM) that generates personalized 
      physical activity recommendations according to the user׳s specific needs and 
      personal interests. The methodology integrates the rule-based reasoning (RBR), 
      case-based reasoning (CBR), and preference-based reasoning (PBR) approaches in a 
      linear combination that enables personalization of recommendations. RBR uses 
      explicit knowledge rules from physical activity guidelines, CBR uses implicit 
      knowledge from experts׳ past experiences, and PBR uses users׳ personal interests 
      and preferences. To validate the methodology, a weight management scenario is 
      considered and experimented with. The RBR part of the methodology generates goal, 
      weight status, and plan recommendations, the CBR part suggests the top three 
      relevant physical activities for executing the recommended plan, and the PBR part 
      filters out irrelevant recommendations from the suggested ones using the user׳s 
      personal preferences and interests. To evaluate the methodology, a baseline-RBR 
      system is developed, which is improved first using ranged rules and ultimately 
      using a hybrid-CBR. A comparison of the results of these systems shows that 
      hybrid-CBR outperforms the modified-RBR and baseline-RBR systems. Hybrid-CBR 
      yields a 0.94% recall, a 0.97% precision, a 0.95% f-score, and low Type I and 
      Type II errors.

TI  - Rutin Attenuates Carfilzomib-Induced Cardiotoxicity Through Inhibition of NF-kappaB, 
      Hypertrophic Gene Expression and Oxidative Stress.
PG  - 58-66

AB  - Carfilzomib is a proteasome inhibitor, commonly used in multiple myeloma, but its 
      clinical use may be limited due to cardiotoxicity. This study was aimed to 
      evaluate the influence of rutin in carfilzomib-induced cardiotoxicity in rats. 
      Wistar albino male rats weighing 200-250 g (approximately 10 weeks old) were 
      taken for this study. Animals were divided into four groups of six animals each. 
      Group 1 served as normal control (NC), received normal saline; group 2 animals 
      received carfilzomib (dissolved in 1 % DMSO) alone; group 3 animals received 
      rutin (20 mg/kg) + carfilzomib; and group 4 animals received rutin 
      (40 mg/kg) + carfilzomib. Hematological changes, biochemical changes, oxidative 
      stress, hypertrophic gene expression, apoptotic gene expression, NFkappaB and IkappaB-alpha 
      protein expression and histopathological evaluation were done to confirm the 
      finding of carfilzomib-induced cardiotoxicity. Treatment with rutin decreased the 
      carfilzomib-induced changes in cardiac enzymes such as lactate dehydrogenase, 
      creatine kinase (CK) and CK-MB. For the assessment of cardiotoxicity, we further 
      evaluated cardiac hypertrophic gene and apoptotic gene expression such as alpha-MHC, 
      beta-MHC and BNP and NF-kappaB and p53 gene expression, respectively, using RT-PCR. 
      Western blot analysis showed that rutin treatment prevented the activation of 
      NF-kappaB by increasing the expression of IkappaB-alpha. Rutin also attenuated the effects of 
      carfilzomib on oxidant-antioxidant including malondialdehyde and reduced 
      glutathione. Histopathological study clearly confirmed that rutin attenuated 
      carfilzomib-induced cardiotoxicity in rats.

TI  - Clinical role of HER2 gene amplification and chromosome 17: a study on 154 
      IHC-equivocal cases of invasive breast carcinoma patients.
PG  - 8665-72
LID - 10.1007/s13277-015-4657-7 [doi]
AB  - Accurate evaluation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status is 
      quite crucial for invasive breast tumor patients in order to select anti-HER2 
      therapy for effective clinical outcomes. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay is 
      routinely used to evaluate the HER2 oncoprotein overexpression but is unable to 
      explain the chromosomal and genetic alterations and has been considered as a hot 
      issue in IHC-equivocal cases. We investigated these molecular aberrations in 
      correlation with prognostic factors. A cohort of 154 IHC-equivocal (+2) cases was 
      selected and retrospectively analyzed by dual-probe fluorescence in situ 
      hybridization (FISH) assay by using locus-specific HER2 and centromere 
      enumeration probes (CEP17) for the identification of HER2 proto-oncogene 
      amplification and chromosomal copy number per cell, respectively. The data were 
      analyzed by SPSS 16.0 version using chi-square test (p < 0.05). We identified 36 
      out of 154 cases (23.4 %) showing HER2 gene amplification (average HER2 gene 
      copies per cell >4 or <4 with HER2/CEP17 ratio >2) in concordance with HER2 
      oncoprotein overexpression, and significant correlation was observed with 
      prognostic parameters including histological type, tumor grade II to III, 
      histology and pathological type, lymphatic invasion, ductal carcinoma in situ 
      (DCIS), and estrogen-positive and progesterone-negative receptors. Of the 154 
      cases, 18 cases (11.7 %) showed polysomy 17 with CEP17 probe signals per cell >/=3 
      and 22 cases (14.3 %) presented monosomy 17 (CEP17 probe signals per cell </=1). 
      Our data indicate that the use of anti-HER2 therapy should not be suggested 
      unless true evaluation of HER2 protein expression is made regarding gene 
      amplification essentially in IHC-ambiguous invasive breast tumors.

TI  - Patient-reported outcomes and their predictors at 2- and 3-year follow-up after 
      immediate latissimus dorsi breast reconstruction and adjuvant treatment.
PG  - 524-36
LID - 10.1002/bjs.10102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to estimate the impact 2 and 3 years after 
      surgery of implant-assisted latissimus dorsi (LDI) and autologous latissimus 
      dorsi (ALD) flap breast reconstructions on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), and, 
      secondarily, to determine whether baseline characteristics can predict PROs. 
      METHODS: This was a multicentre prospective cohort study. The European 
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Core 
      Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and breast cancer module (QLQ-BR23), Functional 
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast (FACT-B), and Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale (HADS) PROs were completed before surgery and at 2 and 3 years 
      after breast reconstruction. The effects of LDI and ALD, adjusted for baseline 
      clinicodemographic characteristics, were estimated with multiple linear 
      regressions. Effect sizes above 0.5 were considered clinically important. 
      RESULTS: Some 206 patients (LDI 93, ALD 113) were recruited in 2007-2013; 66.5 
      per cent were node-negative and 34.6 per cent received radiotherapy. Women with 
      adverse clinicopathological factors were more likely to have received 
      radiotherapy and to undergo ALD. Patients in both surgical groups showed 
      clinically important effects at 2 and 3 years, including improvements in 
      emotional scales, but worse physical functioning, social well-being, body image 
      and anxiety. Radiotherapy adversely affected social functioning at 2 years 
      (P = 0.002). Women undergoing ALD reconstruction had significantly improved 
      sexual functioning at 3 years (P = 0.003) relative to those who had LDI 
      procedures, even after adjusting for case mix (P = 0.007). At 3 years, younger 
      women experienced worse physical well-being than older women (P = 0.006), and 
      chemotherapy was associated with worse arm symptoms (P = 0.005). CONCLUSION: 
      Clinically important changes occurred in physical functioning, breast symptoms, 
      body image and psychological distress. These results will guide selections of key 
      PRO domains and sample-size calculation of future studies.

AB  - Nickel nanomaterials are promising in the biomedical field, especially in cancer 
      diagnostics and targeted therapy, due to their distinctive chemical and physical 
      properties. In this experiment, the toxicity of nickel nanotubes (Ni NTs) were 
      tested in an in vitro cervical cancer model (HeLa cell line) to optimize the 
      parameters of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for their greatest effectiveness. Ni NTs 
      were synthesized by electrodeposition. Morphological analysis and magnetic 
      behavior were examined using a Scanning electron microscope (SEM), an energy 
      dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX) and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) 
      analysis. Phototoxic and cytotoxic effects of nanomaterials were studied using 
      the Ni NTs alone as well as in conjugation with aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA); this 
      was performed both in the dark and under laser exposure. Toxic effects on the 
      HeLa cell model were evaluated by a neutral red assay (NRA) and by detection of 
      intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Furthermore, 10-200 nM of 
      Ni NTs was prepared in solution form and applied to HeLa cells in 96-well plates. 
      Maximum toxicity of Ni NTs complexed with 5-ALA was observed at 100 J/cm2 and 200 
      nM. Up to 65-68% loss in cell viability was observed. Statistical analysis was 
      performed on the experimental results to confirm the worth and clarity of 
      results, with p-values = 0.003 and 0.000, respectively. Current results pave the 
      way for a more rational strategy to overcome the problem of drug bioavailability 
      in nanoparticulate targeted cancer therapy, which plays a dynamic role in 
      clinical practice.

TI  - Increased cardiovascular risks associated with familial inbreeding: a 
      population-based study of adolescent cohort.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity 
      among humans worldwide. We aimed to estimate the effect of familial inbreeding on 
      cardiovascular risks. METHODS: The study was conducted during April 2014 through 
      June 2014, and a total of 587 adolescent subjects (male = 270, female = 317; 
      11-18 years of age) were recruited from five Muslim populations viz., Gujjar and 
      Bakarwal (n = 130), Mughal (n = 111), Malik (n = 114), Syed (n = 108), and Khan 
      (n = 124). Wright's path relationship method was used for calculating the 
      coefficient of inbreeding (F). Anthropometric and physiological parameters were 
      estimated using standard methods. RESULTS: We observed higher mean values for 
      major physiological traits among the inbred subjects in comparison with the 
      non-inbred groups of five different populations. Our study suggests that 
      inbreeding and sex are the key factors affecting cardiovascular profile. 
      Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed inbreeding as a major source of 
      variation for cardiovascular risks, dominating over other factors causing greater 
      variability in the physiological traits. The magnitude of cardiovascular risks 
      shows an increase with the increase in the values of coefficient of inbreeding 
      (i.e., from F = 0.00 to F = 0.125). The abnormal levels of systolic blood 
      pressure (SBP; range 140-159 mm Hg) and fasting blood glucose (FBG; 
      range 101-126 mg per dL) show persuasive increase with an upsurge in the 
      homozygosity level (i.e., coefficient of inbreeding). CONCLUSIONS: Our 
      comprehensive assessment presents the deleterious consequence of inbreeding on 
      cardiovascular profile. This study can be used as fact-sheet for framing the 
      heath policies and hence can play a vital role in genetic counseling strategies 
      for transforming the public opinion regarding the practice of consanguinity and 
      its associated risks.

      photosynthetic capacity of maize (Zea mays L.) plants.
PG  - 18320-31
LID - 10.1007/s11356-016-6976-7 [doi]
AB  - Maize tolerance potential to oil pollution was assessed by growing Zea mays in 
      soil contaminated with varying levels of crude oil (0, 2.5 and 5.0 % v/w basis). 
      Crude oil contamination reduced soil microflora which may be beneficial to plant 
      growth. It was observed that oil pollution caused a remarkable decrease in 
      biomass, leaf water potential, turgor potential, photosynthetic pigments, quantum 
      yield of photosystem II (PSII) (Fv/Fm), net CO2 assimilation rate, leaf nitrogen 
      and total free amino acids. Gas exchange characteristics suggested that reduction 
      in photosynthetic rate was mainly due to metabolic limitations. Fast chlorophyll 
      a kinetic analysis suggested that crude oil damaged PSII donor and acceptor sides 
      and downregulated electron transport as well as PSI end electron acceptors 
      thereby resulting in lower PSII efficiency in converting harvested light energy 
      into biochemical energy. However, maize plants tried to acclimate to moderate 
      level of oil pollution by increasing root diameter and root length relative to 
      its shoot biomass, to uptake more water and mineral nutrients.

AB  - New copper(II)-based complex (1) was synthesized and characterized by analytical, 
      spectroscopic and single crystal X-ray diffraction. The in vitro binding studies 
      of complex 1 with CT DNA and HSA have been investigated by employing biophysical 
      techniques to examine the binding propensity of 1 towards DNA and HSA. The 
      results showed that 1 avidly binds to CT DNA via electrostatic mode along with 
      the hydrogen bonding interaction of NH2 and CN groups of Schiff base ligand with 
      the base pairs of DNA helix, leads to partial unwinding and destabilization of 
      the DNA double helix. Moreover, the CD spectral studies revealed that complex 1 
      binds through groove binding interaction that stabilizes the right-handed B-form 
      of DNA. Complex 1 showed an impressive photoinduced nuclease activity generating 
      single-strand breaks in comparison with the DNA cleavage activity in presence of 
      visible light. The mechanistic investigation revealed the efficiency of 1 to 
      cleave DNA strands by involving the generation of reactive oxygen species. 
      Furthermore, the time dependent DNA cleavage activity showed that there was 
      gradual increase in the amount of NC DNA on increasing the photoexposure time. 
      However, the interaction of 1 and HSA showed that the change of intrinsic 
      fluorescence intensity of HSA was induced by the microenvironment of Trp residue.

TI  - Fenugreek a multipurpose crop: Potentialities and improvements.
PG  - 300-10
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2015.09.015 [doi]
AB  - Fenugreek is one of the oldest medicinal plants with exceptional medicinal and 
      nutritional profile. Fenugreek seeds contain a substantial amount of fiber, 
      phospholipids, glycolipids, oleic acid, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, choline, 
      vitamins A, B1, B2, C, nicotinic acid, niacin, and many other functional 
      elements. It may grow well under diverse and a wide range of conditions; it is 
      moderately tolerant to drought and salinity, and can even be grown on marginal 
      lands in profitable way. Owing to these characteristics and heavy metal 
      remediation potential, fenugreek may well fit several cropping systems. In 
      addition to its medicinal uses, it may serve as an excellent off-season fodder 
      and animal food supplement. However, efforts should be initiated to develop 
      strategies for improving its biomass production; genetic diversity among 
      different accessions may be mapped, breeding and crop improvement programs may be 
      initiated to improve the biomass and nutritional and functional elements. This 
      review highlights the morphology, adaptability, nutritional constituents and 
      associated functionality and medicinal significance of fenugreek; its 
      ethno-historical uses, pharmacological assumptions have also been discussed. 
      Researchable areas are also indicated to improve its production and adaptability.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of medicinal plants in modern medicine for the prevention and 
      treatment of cancer is an important aspect. For this reason, it is important to 
      identify antitumor promoting agents present in medicinal plants commonly used by 
      the human population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used in vivo and in vitro methods 
      using chromosomal aberrations (CAs), sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and 
      replication index (RI) as markers, exposed by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) as 
      well as alcoholic extract of Alstonia scholaris in five increasing concentrations 
      (200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 mg/kg body weight for in vivo and 150, 200, 250 and 
      300 mug/ml of culture) and of three different durations of 24, 48 and 72 h in the 
      presence as well absence of S9 mix. RESULTS: Extracts of Alstonia reduces the 
      total aberrant cells ranges from 10.0% to 41.84% and frequencies of aberration in 
      the aberrant cells ranges from 220 to 124 against 290 aberrations causes due to 
      MMS in vivo. Similarly in the in vitro, it reduces CAs (39.62%, 32.83%, and 
      38.48%) and (45.31%, 44.46%, and 38.34%) at 24, 48, and 72 h of exposure 
      respectively; in the absence as well as presence of liver S9 fraction. It also 
      reduces SCE from 7.70 to 4.20 per cell and enhances RI from 1.45 to 1.64. 
      CONCLUSION: Extracts of Alstonia significantly reduces the number of aberrant 
      cells and frequency of aberration per cell at each concentration and duration of 
      exposure in vivo; and CAs and SCE in vitro and enhances RI.

TI  - ROLE OF DIAGNOSTIC LAPAROSCOPY IN EVALUATION AND TREATMENT OF CHRONIC ABDOMINAL 
      PAIN IN CHILDREN.
PG  - 35-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic abdominal Pain in children is a very common cause of hospital 
      admission. Many of them are discharged without a diagnosis even after battery of 
      investigations. Laparoscopy plays a significant role in diagnosis and management 
      of many causes of acute and chronic abdominal pain. The purpose of this study was 
      to determine the efficacy of laparoscopy as an efficient diagnostic and 
      management tool in children with chronic abdominal pain. METHODS: A descriptive, 
      prospective case series was collected in the department of Paediatric surgery 
      Mayo's Hospital Lahore, over the period of 5 years between Jan 2007-Dec 2013. The 
      data of consecutive 50 patients, who were admitted in the department with the 
      diagnosis of chronic abdominal pain, was recorded. All patients who had 2-3 
      admissions in hospital for last 2 months and failed to establish a definitive 
      diagnosis after clinical examination and base line investigations underwent 
      laparoscopy. The details of associated symptoms, finding of laparoscopy, 
      laparoscopic procedures done, definitive diagnosis, histopathology, complications 
      and relief of symptoms were collected and analysed and results were evaluated 
      using SPSS-17. RESULTS: Out of 50 patients studies, 27/50 (54%) were male, 23/50 
      (46%) were female. Age ranged from 2-12 years, with the mean age of 7.24 year. 
      Tuberculosis abdomen, adhesions, mesenteric lymphadenitis, appendicitis and 
      cholecystitis were the final diagnosis. Five abdomens were found normal on 
      laparoscopy. Complete pain relief was achieved in 30/50 (60%), reduced intensity 
      of pain was gained in 12/50 (24%) cases while 16% (8/50) still complained of 
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopy is an efficient diagnostic and treatment tool in 
      children with chronic unexplained abdominal pain. It avoids serial examinations; 
      prolong admission, battery of investigations and unnecessary surgeries.

AB  - About 3.6 million Pashtun and over 1.5 million immigrants from Afghanistan live 
      in the federally administered tribal areas (FATA) on the border between 
      Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province and southern Afghanistan. Although malaria 
      cases are common in FATA, no detailed studies have yet been performed to reveal 
      the actual status of malaria in the local population and epidemiological data are 
      insufficient to elucidate the actual incidence. A malariometric survey of 691 
      patients of all ages and genders in seven agencies (districts) in FATA was 
      carried out in 2013 using whole blood samples. Microscopically confirmed positive 
      species were subjected to nested-PCR for the reconfirmation and detection of four 
      species of Plasmodium causing human malaria. Of the 626 PCR positive cases, 81.1% 
      were P. vivax, 13.8% P. falciparum and 4.9% mixed species containing both P. 
      vivax and P. falciparum. P. malariae and P. ovale and were not found in any 
      analysis. Sixty-five microscopic positive samples were identified as negative by 
      PCR. The incidence of P. vivax ranged from 10.4% in Orakzai Agency to 22.8% in 
      North Waziristan Agency. The prevalence of P. falciparum ranged from 1.3% in 
      Orakzai Agency to 4.7% in North Waziristan, and Khyber Agency had the highest 
      prevalence of 1.7% of mixed species. In FATA, P. vivax and P. falciparum are the 
      main causative agents of malaria, while mixed species infections are also 
      prevalent with varying transmission intensities. In addition, Estimates of 
      malaria incidence shows that variation in the incidence, frequency and species 
      composition of malarial parasites is high.

LID - 76
AB  - BACKGROUND: The provision of health and wellness care is undergoing an enormous 
      transformation. A key element of this revolution consists in prioritizing 
      prevention and proactivity based on the analysis of people's conducts and the 
      empowerment of individuals in their self-management. Digital technologies are 
      unquestionably destined to be the main engine of this change, with an increasing 
      number of domain-specific applications and devices commercialized every year; 
      however, there is an apparent lack of frameworks capable of orchestrating and 
      intelligently leveraging, all the data, information and knowledge generated 
      through these systems. METHODS: This work presents Mining Minds, a novel 
      framework that builds on the core ideas of the digital health and wellness 
      paradigms to enable the provision of personalized support. Mining Minds embraces 
      some of the most prominent digital technologies, ranging from Big Data and Cloud 
      Computing to Wearables and Internet of Things, as well as modern concepts and 
      methods, such as context-awareness, knowledge bases or analytics, to holistically 
      and continuously investigate on people's lifestyles and provide a variety of 
      smart coaching and support services. RESULTS: This paper comprehensively 
      describes the efficient and rational combination and interoperation of these 
      technologies and methods through Mining Minds, while meeting the essential 
      requirements posed by a framework for personalized health and wellness support. 
      Moreover, this work presents a realization of the key architectural components of 
      Mining Minds, as well as various exemplary user applications and expert tools to 
      illustrate some of the potential services supported by the proposed framework. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Mining Minds constitutes an innovative holistic means to inspect 
      human behavior and provide personalized health and wellness support. The 
      principles behind this framework uncover new research ideas and may serve as a 
      reference for similar initiatives.

AB  - We report "smart" nickel oxide nanoparticles (NOPs) as multimodal cancer therapy 
      agent. Water-dispersible and light-sensitive NiO core was synthesized with folic 
      acid (FA) connected bovine serum albumin (BSA) shell on entrapped doxorubicin 
      (DOX). The entrapped drug from NOP-DOX@BSA-FA was released in a sustained way (64 
      hours, pH=5.5, dark conditions) while a robust release was found under red light 
      exposure (in 1/2 hour under lambdamax=655 nm, 50 mW/cm(2), at pH=5.5). The cell 
      viability, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and diphenylisobenzofuran 
      assays conducted under light and dark conditions revealed a high photodynamic 
      therapy potential of our construct. Furthermore, we found that the combined 
      effect of DOX and NOPs from NOP-DOX@BSA-FA resulted in cell death approximately 
      eightfold high compared to free DOX. We propose that NOP-DOX@BSA-FA is a 
      potential photodynamic therapy agent and a collective drug delivery system for 
      the systemic administration of cancer chemotherapeutics resulting in combination 
      therapy.

AB  - Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) have the potential to be used 
      as multimodal imaging and cancer therapy agents due to their excellent magnetism 
      and ability to generate reactive oxygen species when exposed to light. We report 
      the synthesis of highly biocompatible SPIONs through a facile green approach 
      using fruit peel extracts as the biogenic reductant. This green synthesis 
      protocol involves the stabilization of SPIONs through coordination of different 
      phytochemicals. The SPIONs were functionalized with polyethylene glycol 
      (PEG)-6000 and succinic acid and were extensively characterized by X-ray 
      diffraction analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, 
      energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, Rutherford 
      backscattering spectrometry, diffused reflectance spectroscopy, fluorescence 
      emission, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, ultraviolet-visible 
      spectroscopy, and magnetization analysis. The developed SPIONs were found to be 
      stable, almost spherical with a size range of 17-25 nm. They exhibited excellent 
      water dispersibility, colloidal stability, and relatively high R 2 relaxivity 
      (225 mM(-1) s(-1)). Cell viability assay data revealed that PEGylation or 
      carboxylation appears to significantly shield the surface of the particles but 
      does not lead to improved cytocompatibility. A highly significant increase of 
      reactive oxygen species in light-exposed samples was found to play an important 
      role in the photokilling of human cervical epithelial malignant carcinoma (HeLa) 
      cells. The bio-SPIONs developed are highly favorable for various biomedical 
      applications without risking interference from potentially toxic reagents.

TI  - Detection of Peste des Petits Ruminants Viral RNA in Fecal Samples of Goats after 
      an Outbreak in Punjab Province of Pakistan: A Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 1486824
LID - 10.1155/2016/1486824 [doi]
LID - 1486824
AB  - Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious viral disease of domestic 
      and wild small ruminants and thus has serious socioeconomic implications. In 
      Pakistan, during the year 2012-2013, estimated losses due to PPR were worth Rs. 
      31.51 billions. Close contact between infected and susceptible animals is an 
      important route of transmission of PPR. Therefore, carrier animals play an 
      important role in unnoticed transmission of PPR. The objective of the study was 
      to investigate the detection of PPR virus in goats recovered from PPR. A 
      suspected PPR outbreak was investigated and confirmed as PPR after analysing 
      appropriate samples collected from infected animals using rRT-PCR. A longitudinal 
      study was conducted over the period of 16 weeks to ascertain the detection of PPR 
      virus (PPRV) in faecal samples of recovered goats. Ninety-six (96) faecal samples 
      from each sampling were collected at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after the outbreak. 
      Faecal samples were analysed using rRT-PCR. Of 96 from each sampling a total of 
      46, 37, 29, and 25 samples were positive for PPR viral genome at 4, 8, 12, and 16 
      weeks, respectively, after recovery. Attempts were made for the isolation of PPR 
      virus on Vero cells, but results were negative. These results indicated the 
      detection of PPR viral RNA up to 16 weeks after infection. Therefore, these 
      results may help in the future epidemiology of PPR virus shedding and possible 
      role as source of silent infection for healthy animals especially when there is 
      no history of any outbreak in nearby flock or area.

TI  - Two-Spotted Ladybeetle Adalia bipunctata L. (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae): A 
      Commercially Available Predator to Control Asian Citrus Psyllid Diaphorina citri 
      (Hemiptera: Liviidae).
PG  - e0162843

LID - e0162843
AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama (Hemiptera: Liviidae) is an 
      economically important pest of citrus because it serves as a vector of the causal 
      pathogens of huanglongbing (HLB) also known as citrus greening disease. The 
      increased use of insecticides for control of D. citri negatively impacts several 
      natural enemies including some effective ladybeetle species which are not 
      available commercially. The two-spotted ladybeetle, Adalia bipunctata 
      (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) is found in some crop and forest ecosystems of Asia, 
      Europe and North America and available commercially. It is known to attack aphids 
      and mealybugs but there are no published records of feeding on psyllids. We 
      evaluated suitability and preference of A. bipunctata for nymphs of D. citri 
      compared to corn leaf aphid Rhopalosiphum maidis (Hemiptera: Aphididae) a global 
      pest of cereal crops and prey for many predaceous insects. We also compared 
      development and reproduction of A. bipunctata on these two species with frozen 
      eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae) 
      at 25 degrees C. Initially, more D. citri than R. maidis nymphs were consumed in the 
      no-choice tests although final consumption by larva and adult of A. bipunctata 
      did not differ in the choice and no-choice tests. Larval development was 
      prolonged by one day on D. citri compared to R. maidis nymphs but did not differ 
      between either of these diets and E. kuehniella. Larval survival to adult 
      averaged 93-100% and was not impacted by diet. Adult life span did not differ 
      between diets although those on D. citri and R. maidis nymphs weighed less and 
      produced fewer but more fertile eggs than on E. kuehniella eggs. Significant 
      reduction of D. citri nymphs averaging 54% was observed in colonies caged with 
      adult A. bipunctata on field planted citrus. R degrees  (net reproductive rate) was least 
      for beetles fed R. maidis, but otherwise there were no significant differences in 
      demographic parameters. Successful feeding, development and reproductive 
      performance of A. bipunctata suggest its usefulness as biological control agent 
      of D. citri as well as aphid species exemplified by R. maidis.

      cross-sectional study from Northern India.
PG  - 18-26
LID - 10.1038/pr.2016.177 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to understand the relationship between 
      consanguineous marriages and reproductive outcomes. METHODS: A total of 999 
      families were recruited from five Muslim populations of Jammu region. Family 
      pedigrees were drawn to access the family history and inbreeding status in terms 
      of coefficient of inbreeding (F). Fertility, mortality, secondary sex ratio, 
      selection intensity, and lethal equivalents were measured using standard methods. 
      RESULTS: The significant differences for gross fertility was found to be higher 
      among inbred groups as compared to the unrelated families (P < 0.05) and higher 
      mortality rates were observed among consanguineous families of all populations in 
      comparison with the non-consanguineous family groups. Moreover, the prenatal and 
      postnatal child mortality rates (i.e., U5MR and U18MR) have presented a 
      persuasive increase with an upsurge in the homozygosity level. The mortality rate 
      was found to be maximum among families with the highest value of coefficient of 
      inbreeding (F). The selection intensity (SI) also showed inflations among 
      families with respect to their increasing inbreeding coefficients. The greater 
      values of lethal equivalents per gamete (LEs/gamete) were observed for autosomal 
      inheritance in comparison with sex-linked inheritance. CONCLUSION: Our conclusive 
      assessment brings out the deleterious consequence of consanguineous marriages on 
      reproductive outcomes.

AB  - In this study, Paclitaxel (PTX) containing, bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
      nanoparticles were fabricated via a simple approach. Folic acid (FA) was 
      conjugated to chitosan (CS)/carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) through an 
      esterification reaction to produce BSA-CS-FA or BSA-CMC-FA conjugates. 
      NiFe(2)O(4) noncore (NFs) and PTX were loaded through a heat treatment and by a 
      diffusion process. NFs-BSA-CS and NFs-BSA-CMC-FA with size of about 80nm, showed 
      superior transversal R(2) relaxation rate of 349 (mM)(-1)s(-1) along with folate 
      receptor-targeted and magnetically directed functions. NFs-BSA-CS-FA or 
      NFs-BSA-CS-FA were found stable and biocompatible. Application of an external 
      magnetic field effectively enhanced the PTX release from PTX-NFs-BSA-CS-FA or 
      PTX-NFs-BSA-CS-FA and hence tumor inhibition rate. This study validate that 
      NFs-BSA-CS-FA or NFs-BSA-CMC-FA and PTX-NFs-BSA-CS-FA or PTX-NFs-BSA-CS-FA are 
      suitable systems for tumor diagnosis and therapy.

TI  - Dosimetric and radiobiological characterizations of prostate intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy and volumetric-modulated arc therapy: A single-institution review of 
      ninety cases.
PG  - 162-8
LID - 10.4103/0971-6203.189479 [doi]
AB  - This study reviewed prostate volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans with 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) plans after prostate IMRT technique was 
      replaced by VMAT in an institution. Characterizations of dosimetry and 
      radiobiological variation in prostate were determined based on treatment plans of 
      40 prostate IMRT patients (planning target volume = 77.8-335 cm(3)) and 50 VMAT 
      patients (planning target volume = 120-351 cm(3)) treated before and after 2013, 
      respectively. Both IMRT and VMAT plans used the same dose-volume criteria in the 
      inverse planning optimization. Dose-volume histogram, mean doses of target and 
      normal tissues (rectum, bladder and femoral heads), dose-volume points (D99% of 
      planning target volume; D30%, D50%, V30 Gy and V35 Gy of rectum and bladder; D5%, 
      V14 Gy, V22 Gy of femoral heads), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), 
      gradient index (GI), prostate tumor control probability (TCP), and rectal normal 
      tissue complication probability (NTCP) based on the Lyman-Burman-Kutcher 
      algorithm were calculated for each IMRT and VMAT plan. From our results, VMAT 
      plan was found better due to its higher (1.05%) CI, lower (0.83%) HI and (0.75%) 
      GI than IMRT. Comparing doses in normal tissues between IMRT and VMAT, it was 
      found that IMRT mostly delivered higher doses of about 1.05% to the normal 
      tissues than VMAT. Prostate TCP and rectal NTCP were found increased (1%) for 
      VMAT than IMRT. It is seen that VMAT technique can decrease the dose-volume 
      evaluation criteria for the normal tissues. Based on our dosimetric and 
      radiobiological results in treatment plans, it is concluded that our VMAT 
      implementation could produce comparable or slightly better target coverage and 
      normal tissue sparing with a faster treatment time in prostate radiotherapy.

TI  - Fusion Molecules of Heat Shock Protein HSPX with Other Antigens of Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis Show High Potential in Serodiagnosis of Tuberculosis.
PG  - e0163349

LID - e0163349
AB  - Variable individual response against the antigens of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
      necessitates detection of multiple antibodies for enhancing reliability of 
      serodiagnosis of tuberculosis. Fusion molecules consisting of two or more 
      antigens showing high sensitivity would be helpful in achieving this objective. 
      Antigens of M. tuberculosis HSPX and PE35 were expressed in a soluble form 
      whereas tnPstS1 and FbpC1 were expressed as inclusion bodies at 37 degrees C. Heat shock 
      protein HSPX when attached to the N-termini of the antigens PE35, tnPstS1 and 
      FbpC1, all the fusion molecules were expressed at high levels in E. coli in a 
      soluble form. ELISA analysis of the plasma samples of TB patients against 
      HSPX-tnPstS1 showed 57.7% sensitivity which is nearly the same as the expected 
      combined value obtained after deducting the number of plasma samples (32) 
      containing the antibodies against both the individual antigens. Likewise, the 
      54.4% sensitivity of HSPX-PE35 was nearly the same as that expected from the 
      combined values of the contributing antigens. Structural analysis of all the 
      fusion molecules by CD spectroscopy showed that alpha-helical and beta-sheet contents 
      were found close to those obtained through molecular modeling. Molecular modeling 
      studies of HSPX-tnPstS1 and HSPX-PE35 support the analytical results as most of 
      the epitopes of the contributing antigens were found to be available for binding 
      to the corresponding antibodies. Using these fusion molecules in combination with 
      other antigenic molecules should reduce the number of antigenic proteins required 
      for a more reliable and economical serodiagnosis of tuberculosis. Also, HSPX 
      seems to have potential application in soluble expression of heterologous 
      proteins in E. coli.

      Streptococcus pneumoniae.
PG  - 101
LID - 101
AB  - Here, we analyze the transcriptomic response of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 to 
      N-acetylgalactosamine (NAGa). Transcriptome comparison of S. pneumoniae D39 grown 
      in NAGaM17 (0.5% NAGa + M17) to that grown in GM17 (0.5% Glucose + M17) revealed 
      the elevated expression of various carbon metabolic genes/operons, including a 
      PTS operon (denoted here as the aga operon), which is putatively involved in NAGa 
      transport and utilization, in the presence of NAGa. We further studied the role 
      of a GntR-family transcriptional regulator (denoted here as AgaR) in the 
      regulation of aga operon. Our transcriptome and RT-PCR data suggest the role of 
      AgaR as a transcriptional repressor of the aga operon. We predicted a 20-bp 
      operator site of AagR (5'-ATAATTAATATAACAACAAA-3') in the promoter region of the 
      aga operon (PbgaC), which was further verified by mutating the AgaR operator site 
      in the respective promoter. The role of CcpA in the additional regulation of the 
      aga operon was elucidated by further transcriptome analyses and confirmed by 
      quantitative RT-PCR.

TI  - Methylferulate from Tamarix aucheriana inhibits growth and enhances 
      chemosensitivity of human colorectal cancer cells: possible mechanism of action.
PG  - 384
LID - 384
AB  - BACKGROUND: Natural products are valuable sources for anticancer agents. In the 
      present study, methylferulate (MF) was identified for the first time from Tamarix 
      aucheriana. Spectral data were used for identification of MF. The potential of MF 
      to control cell growth, cell cycle, apoptosis, generation of reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS), cancer cell invasion, nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) DNA-binding 
      activity and proteasomal activities, as well as the enhancement of 
      chemosensitivity in human colorectal cancer cells, were evaluated. The possible 
      molecular mechanism of MF's therapeutic efficacy was also assessed. METHODS: 
      Column chromatography and spectral data were used for isolation and 
      identification of MF. MTT, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, in vitro invasion, 
      fluoremetry, EIA and Real time qPCR were used to measure antiproliferative, 
      chemo-sensitizing effects and other biochemical parameters. RESULTS: MF showed a 
      dose-dependent anti-proliferative effect on colorectal cancer cells 
      (IC(50) = 1.73 - 1.9 mM) with a nonsignificant cytotoxicity toward normal human 
      fibroblast. Colony formation inhibition (P </= 0.001, 0.0001) confirmed the growth 
      inhibition by MF. MF arrested cell cycle progression in the S and G2/M phases; 
      induced apoptosis and ROS generation; and inhibited NF-kB DNA-binding activity, 
      proteasomal activities and cell invasion in colorectal cancer cells. MF 
      up-regulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p19 (INK4D), p21(WAF1/CIP1), 
      p27(KIP1)), pro-apoptotic gene expression (Bax, Bad, Apaf1, Bid, Bim, Smac) and 
      caspases (caspase 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9). Moreover, MF down-regulated cyclin-dependent 
      kinases (Cdk1, Cdk2) and anti-apoptotic gene expression (c-IAP-1, c-IAP-2, 
      Bcl2,FLIP). In addition, MF differentially potentiated the sensitivity of 
      colorectal cancer cells to standard chemotherapeutic drugs. CONCLUSION: MF showed 
      a multifaceted anti-proliferative and chemosensitizing effects. These results 
      suggest the chemotherapeutic and co-adjuvant potential of MF.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of electronic health records (EHRs), there is 
      a growing need to expand the utilization of EHR data to support clinical 
      research. The key challenge in achieving this goal is the unavailability of smart 
      systems and methods to overcome the issue of data preparation, structuring, and 
      sharing for smooth clinical research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a 
      robust analysis system called the smart extraction and analysis system (SEAS) 
      that consists of two subsystems: (1) the information extraction system (IES), for 
      extracting information from clinical documents, and (2) the survival analysis 
      system (SAS), for a descriptive and predictive analysis to compile the survival 
      statistics and predict the future chance of survivability. The IES subsystem is 
      based on a novel permutation-based pattern recognition method that extracts 
      information from unstructured clinical documents. Similarly, the SAS subsystem is 
      based on a classification and regression tree (CART)-based prediction model for 
      survival analysis. RESULTS: SEAS is evaluated and validated on a real-world case 
      study of head and neck cancer. The overall information extraction accuracy of the 
      system for semistructured text is recorded at 99%, while that for unstructured 
      text is 97%. Furthermore, the automated, unstructured information extraction has 
      reduced the average time spent on manual data entry by 75%, without compromising 
      the accuracy of the system. Moreover, around 88% of patients are found in a 
      terminal or dead state for the highest clinical stage of disease (level IV). 
      Similarly, there is an  approximately 36% probability of a patient being alive if at least one 
      of the lifestyle risk factors was positive. CONCLUSION: We presented our work on 
      the development of SEAS to replace costly and time-consuming manual methods with 
      smart automatic extraction of information and survival prediction methods. SEAS 
      has reduced the time and energy of human resources spent unnecessarily on manual 
      tasks.

AB  - Relocation of a bioactive photosensitizer, namely phenosafranin (PSF), from the 
      phenazinium family, has been demonstrated from non-ionic micellar carrier to the 
      DNA. For the purpose, interaction of micelle-bound PSF with calf thymus DNA 
      (ctDNA) has been investigated vividly exploiting various spectroscopic techniques 
      like absorption, steady state and time resolved emission, fluorescence 
      anisotropy, circular dichroism etc. Experimental outcomes reveal that PSF binds 
      strongly with both the micelle as well as the DNA. In the presence of DNA, 
      however, relocation of the micelle-carried PSF occurs from the micelle to the 
      DNA. Competitive binding of the probe between micelle and the DNA is assigned 
      responsible for this relocation. Circular dichroism spectral measurements reflect 
      that the DNA conformation remains intact in the presence of the micelle 
      advocating that the non-ionic micelles can safely be used for the drug delivery 
      purpose. The work is expected to encourage development of newer carriers for DNA 
      targeted drug delivery.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In the study area, the traditional knowledge and 
      cultural practices of utilizing medicinal plants in the human healthcare is 
      primarily restricted to the old age members of the community, while younger 
      generation is mostly unaware of the natural wealth usage. AIM OF THE STUDY: We 
      provide the first ever ethno medicinal insights into the management of dental 
      disorders in Pakistan. The prime objective of the study was to explore novel 
      knowledge of these local and remote community members and share it with rest of 
      the world in documented form. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Field surveys were arranged 
      for collection and documentation of medicinal plants of Manoor valley during 
      2015. Total 71 local inhabitants were interviewed randomly through questionnaire. 
      The data obtained were quantitatively analyzed using the use value (UVi), 
      relative frequency citations (RFCs), fidelity level index (FL%) and consensus 
      index (CI%). For novel uses all plants were thoroughly checked with previously 
      published articles on the same disorder and analyzed through Jaccard index (JI) 
      and Sorensen's similarity index (QS). The collected specimens after confirmation 
      were submitted to the Herbarium, Department of Botany, Hazara University, 
      Mansehra, Pakistan (HUP). RESULTS: In present study 25 plants belonging to 17 
      families are reported, these plants were used commonly as ethno medicine. There 
      were herbs (64%), shrubs (20%) and trees (16%) whereas, Lamiaceae with 4 species 
      was the leading family. Majority of medicinal plant species were used in 
      treatment of toothache (38%), wound healing (19%), gum infections (16%) whereas 
      and lowest percentage of species were used for mouth ulcer as well as teeth 
      powder (3%). Leaves were the most widely part used plant part in the treatment of 
      different diseases (36%). Dominated medicinal plants with high used values were 
      Juglans regia (UVi=0.94), Rumex dentatus (0.89) and Indigofera heterantha (0.88). 
      Based on the RFC values, the most valuable and cited medicinal plant species used 
      by the traditional drivers are Juglans regia having (RFCs=0.69) and Rumex 
      dentatus (0.58). CI results show that most respondents percentage was for Juglans 
      regia having CI%=69%, followed by Rumex dentatus (57.7%). Medicinal plants with 
      high fidelity level and reported for one dental disorder were Berberis lycium, 
      Geranium wallichianum, Lathyrus aphaca, Platanus orientalis, Sedum spp. and 
      Urtica dioica for toothache. Further, new medicinal uses of Abies pindrow, Ajuga 
      integrifolia, Berberis lycium, Urtica dioica, Indigofera heterantha were recorded 
      for the first time from Pakistan and Astragalus grahamianus, Corydalis cornuta, 
      Prunella vulgaris, Ranunculus muricatus, Rumex hastatus, Stellaria media, Tagetes 
      minuta, Taraxacum officinale and Lathyrus aphaca, across the world for the 
      current reported medicinal uses. All mentioned plant species are reported for the 
      first time ever for dental disorders from Manoor Valley. Nonetheless, this is a 
      novel study as no single ethno medicinal study on dental disorder up-till now has 
      been reported from Pakistan. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first ever 
      documentation of ethno medicinal practices aiming at the dental disorders in 
      Pakistan, which resulted in 64% of medicinal uses new claims. So, the reported 
      species of remote valley should be further evaluated for proper experimentation 
      and pharmacological activities to authenticate their current traditional usage. 
      Field observation revealed vegetation of the area was generally threatened due to 
      its unwise use by the local communities. Trends like deforestation, over grazing, 
      habitat fragmentation and introduction of the exotic taxa were the visible 
      threats. So conservation of such an important natural God gifted treasure is 
      mandatory.

TI  - Endogenous Activation-Induced Delivery of a Bioactive Photosensitizer from a 
      Micellar Carrier to Natural DNA.
PG  - 11492-11501
AB  - The photophysics of phenosafranin (PSF), a member of the photosensitizer 
      phenazinium family, has been explored in nonionic Triton X-165 (TX-165) micelle, 
      calf thymus DNA (ctDNA), and a composite environment consisting of both micelle 
      and DNA, using diverse spectroscopic techniques of both steady-state and 
      time-resolved natures, to divulge the binding interactions of the probe with 
      different hosts. The vivid experimental results demonstrate that PSF binds with 
      both micelle and DNA; however, the binding affinity of the probe is much higher 
      toward the DNA. When micelle-carried PSF comes in proximity to ctDNA, PSF gets 
      released from the micellar environment and intercalates with the DNA base pairs. 
      Endogenous activation, in terms of a higher binding affinity of PSF toward ctDNA 
      relative to that toward the micelle, is ascribed to be responsible for this 
      transfer. Thus, this article demonstrates endogenous transfer of a bioactive 
      molecular probe from a micellar nanocarrier to natural DNA. As the carrier 
      micelle (TX-165) does not perturb the structure of the DNA, this work proposes 
      that it can be used promisingly for the purpose of safe delivery of drugs. The 
      study is expected to stimulate the generation of and/or search for advanced 
      micelle-based carrier systems for delivery of bioactive molecular systems to 
      biological targets like DNA.

TI  - Frequency of different types of gastric varices in patients with cirrhosis due to 
      chronic hepatitis C.
PG  - 1462-1465
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of different types of gastric varices in 
      patients with hepatitis C virus-related cirrhosis. METHODS: The observational 
      cross-sectional study was conducted from August 2014 to August 2015 at Aziz 
      Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital, Gujrat, Pakistan, using non-probability 
      consecutive sampling. Patients having liver cirrhosis only due to chronic 
      hepatitis C virus, portal vein diameter >12mm or spleen size >12cm in long axis 
      and ascites with no previous history of variceal banding were included. Patients 
      having cirrhosis due to other causes were excluded. Data was collected using a 
      proforma that was filled by taking history, laboratory studies, abdominal 
      ultrasound and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastric varices were classified 
      using Sarin classification. SPSS 20 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: 
      Out of 205 patients undergoing esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, 122(59.5%) were male 
      and 83(40.5%) were female with an overall mean age of 49.5+/-7.49 years. Gastric 
      varices were present in 30(14.6%) patients. Among them, type 1 was present in 
      23(76.71%), type 2 in 6(19.86%) and isolated gastric varices type 1 in 
      3(10.27%).Isolated gastric varices type 2 was not present in any patient. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Gastric varices were present in minority of patients undergoing 
      esophago-gastroduodenoscopy, and among them, gastroesophageal varices type 1 was 
      the most common, while isolated gastric varices type 2 was not present in any 
      patient.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nanocomposites (integrating the nano and composite technologies) for 
      advanced fuel cells (NANOCOFC) demonstrate the great potential to reduce the 
      operational temperature of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) significantly in the low 
      temperature (LT) range 300-600 masculineC. NANOCOFC has offered the development of 
      multi-functional materials composed of semiconductor and ionic materials to meet 
      the requirements of low temperature solid oxide fuel cell (LTSOFC) and green 
      energy conversion devices with their unique mechanisms. DESCRIPTION: This work 
      reviews the recent developments relevant to the devices and the patents in 
      LTSOFCs from nanotechnology perspectives that reports advances including 
      fabrication methods, material compositions, characterization techniques and cell 
      performances. CONCLUSION: Finally, the future scope of LTSOFC with nanotechnology 
      and the practical applications are also discussed.

TI  - Remediation of sewage and industrial effluent using bacterially assisted floating 
      treatment wetlands vegetated with Typha domingensis.
PG  - 2192-2201
AB  - This investigation reports the quantitative assessment of endophyte-assisted 
      floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) for the remediation of sewage and industrial 
      wastewater. Typha domingensis was used to vegetate FTWs that were subsequently 
      inoculated with a consortium of pollutant-degrading and plant growth-promoting 
      endophytic bacteria. T. domingensis, being an aquatic species, holds excellent 
      potential to remediate polluted water. Nonetheless, investigation conducted on 
      Madhuana drain carrying industrial and sewage water from Faisalabad City revealed 
      the percentage reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD) and biochemical oxygen 
      demand (BOD(5)) to be 87% and 87.5%, respectively, within 96 h on coupling the 
      plant species with a consortium of bacterial endophytes. With the endophytes 
      surviving in plant tissue, maximal reduction was obtained in not only the 
      aforementioned pollution parameters but for other major environmental quality 
      parameters including nutrients (N and P), ions (Na(+) and K(+)), Cl(-), and 
      SO(4)(2-) as well, which showed percentage reductions up to 90%, 39%, 77%, 91.8%, 
      40%, and 60%, respectively. This significant improvement in polluted wastewater 
      quality treated with the proposed method render it safe to be discharged freely 
      in larger water bodies as per the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) 
      of Pakistan or to be reused safely for irrigation purposes; thus, FTWs provide a 
      sustainable and affordable approach for in situ remediation of sewage and 
      industrial wastewater.

TI  - Genetics of consanguinity and inbreeding in health and disease.
PG  - 99-107
LID - 10.1080/03014460.2016.1265148 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Inbreeding increases the level of homozygotes for autosomal recessive 
      disorders and is the major objective in clinical studies. The prevalence of 
      consanguinity and the degree of inbreeding vary from one population to another 
      depending on ethnicity, religion, culture and geography. Global epidemiological 
      studies have revealed that consanguineous unions have been significantly 
      associated with increased susceptibility to various forms of inherited diseases. 
      OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to determine the role of consanguinity in human health 
      and to highlight the associated risks for various diseases or disorders. METHODS: 
      PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were used to explore the published 
      literature on consanguinity and its associated risks using the key words 
      "consanguinity", "prevalence", "inbreeding depression", "coefficient of 
      inbreeding", "child health", "mortality", "human health", "homozygosity" and 
      "complex diseases" in different combinations. The studies were screened for 
      eligibility on the basis of their epidemiological relevance. RESULTS: This 
      comprehensive assessment highlights the deleterious consequences in populations 
      with a higher prevalence of consanguinity among different countries worldwide. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To avoid the inbreeding load there is the need to improve 
      socioeconomic and educational status and to increase public awareness of 
      reproductive health and anticipated deleterious effects. Pre-marital and 
      pre-conception counselling of consanguineous populations should be an integral 
      part of health policy to train people and make people aware of its harmful 
      consequences. Furthermore, runs of homozygosity (ROH) and whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES) are useful tools in exploring new genomic signatures for the cause of 
      inbreeding depression.

TI  - N-acetylglucosamine-Mediated Expression of nagA and nagB in Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae.
PG  - 158
LID - 158
AB  - In this study, we have explored the transcriptomic response of Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae D39 to N-acetylglucosamine (NAG). Transcriptome comparison of S. 
      pneumoniae D39 wild-type grown in chemically defined medium (CDM) in the presence 
      of 0.5% NAG to that grown in the presence of 0.5% glucose revealed elevated 
      expression of many genes/operons, including nagA, nagB, manLMN, and nanP. We have 
      further confirmed the NAG-dependent expression of nagA, nagB, manLMN, and nanP by 
      beta-galactosidase assays. nagA, nagB and glmS are putatively regulated by a 
      transcriptional regulator NagR. We predicted the operator site of NagR (dre site) 
      in PnagA, PnagB, and PglmS, which was further confirmed by mutating the predicted 
      dre site in the respective promoters (nagA, nagB, and glmS). Growth comparison of 
      DeltanagA, DeltanagB, and DeltaglmS with the D39 wild-type demonstrates that nagA and nagB 
      are essential for S. pneumoniae D39 to grow in the presence of NAG as a sole 
      carbon source. Furthermore, deletion of ccpA shows that CcpA has no effect on the 
      expression of nagA, nagB, and glmS in the presence of NAG in S. pneumoniae.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the transcriptomic response of Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae D39 to cysteine. Transcriptome comparison of the D39 wild-type grown 
      at a restricted concentration of cysteine (0.03 mM) to one grown at a high 
      concentration of cysteine (50 mM) in chemically-defined medium (CDM) revealed 
      elevated expression of various genes/operons, i.e., spd-0150, metQ, spd-0431, 
      metEF, gshT, spd-0618, fhs, tcyB, metB-csd, metA, spd-1898, yvdE, and cysK, 
      likely to be involved in the transport and utilization of cysteine and/or 
      methionine. Microarray-based data were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. 
      Promoter lacZ-fusion studies and quantitative RT-PCR data showed that the 
      transcriptional regulator CmbR acts as a transcriptional repressor of spd-0150, 
      metEF, gshT, spd-0618, tcyB, metA, and yvdE, putatively involved in cysteine 
      uptake and utilization. The operator site of CmbR in the promoter regions of 
      CmbR-regulated genes is predicted and confirmed by mutating or deleting CmbR 
      operator sites from the promoter regions of these genes.

AB  - The green lacewing, Chrysoperla carnea Stephens (Neuroptera: Chrysopidae) is a 
      major generalist predator employed in integrated pest management (IPM) plans for 
      pest control on many crops. Nitenpyram, a neonicotinoid insecticide has widely 
      been used against the sucking pests of cotton in Pakistan. Therefore, a field 
      green lacewing strain was exposed to nitenpyram for five generations to 
      investigate resistance evolution, cross-resistance pattern, stability, realized 
      heritability, and mechanisms of resistance. Before starting the selection with 
      nitenpyram, a field collected strain showed 22.08-, 23.09-, 484.69- and 
      602.90-fold resistance to nitenpyram, buprofezin, spinosad and acetamiprid, 
      respectively compared with the Susceptible strain. After continuous selection for 
      five generations (G1-G5) with nitenpyram in the laboratory, the Field strain 
      (Niten-SEL) developed a resistance ratio of 423.95 at G6. The Niten-SEL strain at 
      G6 showed no cross-resistance to buprofezin and acetamiprid and negative 
      cross-resistance to spinosad compared with the Field strain (G1). For resistance 
      stability, the Niten-SEL strain was left unexposed to any insecticide for four 
      generations (G6-G9) and bioassay results at G10 showed that resistance to 
      nitenpyram, buprofezin and spinosad was stable, while resistance to acetamiprid 
      was unstable. The realized heritability values were 0.97, 0.16, 0.03, and -0.16 
      to nitenpyram, buprofezin, acetamiprid and spinosad, respectively, after five 
      generations of selection. Moreover, the enzyme inhibitors (PBO or DEF) 
      significantly decreased the nitenpyram resistance in the resistant strain, 
      suggesting that resistance was due to microsomal oxidases and esterases. These 
      results are very helpful for integration of green lacewings in IPM programs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A wealth of clinical data exists in clinical documents in the form of 
      electronic health records (EHRs). This data can be used for developing 
      knowledge-based recommendation systems that can assist clinicians in clinical 
      decision making and education. One of the big hurdles in developing such systems 
      is the lack of automated mechanisms for knowledge acquisition to enable and 
      educate clinicians in informed decision making. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 
      automated knowledge acquisition methodology with a comprehensible knowledge model 
      for cancer treatment (CKM-CT) is proposed. With the CKM-CT, clinical data are 
      acquired automatically from documents. Quality of data is ensured by correcting 
      errors and transforming various formats into a standard data format. Data 
      preprocessing involves dimensionality reduction and missing value imputation. 
      Predictive algorithm selection is performed on the basis of the ranking score of 
      the weighted sum model. The knowledge builder prepares knowledge for 
      knowledge-based services: clinical decisions and education support. RESULTS: Data 
      is acquired from 13,788 head and neck cancer (HNC) documents for 3447 patients, 
      including 1526 patients of the oral cavity site. In the data quality task, 160 
      staging values are corrected. In the preprocessing task, 20 attributes and 106 
      records are eliminated from the dataset. The Classification and Regression Trees 
      (CRT) algorithm is selected and provides 69.0% classification accuracy in 
      predicting HNC treatment plans, consisting of 11 decision paths that yield 11 
      decision rules. CONCLUSION: Our proposed methodology, CKM-CT, is helpful to find 
      hidden knowledge in clinical documents. In CKM-CT, the prediction models are 
      developed to assist and educate clinicians for informed decision making. The 
      proposed methodology is generalizable to apply to data of other domains such as 
      breast cancer with a similar objective to assist clinicians in decision making 
      and education.

TI  - Evaluation of foot and mouth vaccination for yak (Bos grunniens) in Pakistan.
PG  - 691-695
LID - 10.1007/s11250-017-1245-4 [doi]
AB  - In northern Pakistan, many farming communities rely on domestic yak (Bos 
      grunniens) as a principle source of income. A 2006 participatory disease 
      surveillance report from this region indicated that foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) 
      is the most prevalent annual disease of yak. Our objectives of this study were to 
      determine exposure levels of yak to FMD virus; implement a vaccination program 
      based on current, regional FMD virus serotypes and subtypes; and quantify immune 
      responses following vaccination. Blood samples were used to determine 
      pre-vaccination exposure of animals to FMD virus by antibody presence to 
      non-structural proteins of FMD virus using a 3-ABC trapping indirect ELISA. 
      Vaccine used consisted of FMD serotypes 'O' (PanAsia-2), 'A' (Iran-05), and 
      'Asia-1' (Shamir), but changed later during the study to match newly circulating 
      viruses in the country ('O'-PanAsia-2; 'A'-Turk-06 and Asia-1-Sindh-08). Three 
      hundred sixty-three blood samples were tested from selected villages to determine 
      pre-vaccination FMD virus exposure in yak with an average of 37.7%. Immune 
      responses from initial vaccination and booster dose 30 days later showed clear 
      protective levels (as mean percent inhibition) of antibodies against structural 
      proteins of serotypes 'O,' 'A,' and 'Asia-1.' These responses remained above 
      threshold positive level even at day 210 following initial vaccination. Results 
      of sero-surveillance and anecdotal information of repeated FMD outbreaks 
      demonstrate the persistence of FMD virus of yak in northern Pakistan. Laboratory 
      results and field observations clearly indicated that yak can be protected 
      against FMD with a good quality vaccine with FMD serotype(s) matching current, 
      regionally circulating FMD virus.

AB  - Aspirin or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a medicine used to treat pain, fever, 
      and inflammation. Here, we for the very first time reported the genome-wide 
      transcriptional profiling of aspirin-regulated genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      in the presence of 5 mM aspirin in chemically-defined medium (CDM) using 
      microarray analysis. Our results showed that expression of several genes was 
      differentially expressed in the presence of aspirin. These genes were further 
      grouped into COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) functional categories based on 
      the putative functions of the corresponding proteins. Most of affected genes 
      belong to COG category E (Amino acid transport and metabolism), G (Carbohydrate 
      transport and metabolism), J (Translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis), 
      and I (Lipid transport and metabolism). Transcriptional profiling data of 
      aspirin-regulated genes was deposited to Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database 
      under accession number GSE94514.

AB  - The combined use of plants and bacteria is a promising approach for the 
      remediation of polluted soil. In the current study, the potential of bacterial 
      endophytes in partnership with Leptochloa fusca (L.) Kunth was evaluated for the 
      remediation of uranium (U)- and lead (Pb)-contaminated soil. L. fusca was 
      vegetated in contaminated soil and inoculated with three different endophytic 
      bacterial strains, Pantoea stewartii ASI11, Enterobacter sp. HU38, and 
      Microbacterium arborescens HU33, individually as well as in combination. The 
      results showed that the L. fusca can grow in the contaminated soil. Bacterial 
      inoculation improved plant growth and phytoremediation capacity: this manifested 
      in the form of a 22-51% increase in root length, 25-62% increase in shoot height, 
      10-21% increase in chlorophyll content, and 17-59% more plant biomass in U- and 
      Pb-contaminated soils as compared to plants without bacterial inoculation. 
      Although L. fusca plants showed potential to accumulate U and Pb in their root 
      and shoot on their own, bacterial consortia further enhanced metal uptake 
      capacity by 53-88% for U and 58-97% for Pb. Our results indicate that the 
      combination of L. fusca and endophytic bacterial consortia can effectively be 
      used for the phytostabilization of both U- and Pb-contaminated soils.

AB  - NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide) biosynthesis is vital for bacterial 
      physiology and plays an important role in cellular metabolism. A naturally 
      occurring vitamin B complex, niacin (nicotinic acid), is a precursor of coenzymes 
      NAD and NADP. Here, we study the impact of niacin on global gene expression of 
      Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 and elucidate the role of NiaR as a transcriptional 
      regulator of niaX, nadC, and pnuC. Transcriptome comparison of the D39 wild-type 
      grown in chemically defined medium (CDM) with 0 to 10 mM niacin revealed elevated 
      expression of various genes, including niaX, nadC, pnuC, fba, rex, gapN, pncB, 
      gap, adhE, and adhB2 that are putatively involved in the transport and 
      utilization of niacin. Niacin-dependent expression of these genes is confirmed by 
      promoter lacZ-fusion studies. Moreover, the role of transcriptional regulator 
      NiaR in the regulation of these genes is explored by DNA microarray analysis. Our 
      transcriptomic comparison of D39 DeltaniaR to D39 wild-type revealed that the 
      transcriptional regulator NiaR acts as a transcriptional repressor of niaX, pnuC, 
      and nadC. NiaR-dependent regulation of niaX, nadC, and pnuC is further confirmed 
      by promoter lacZ-fusion studies. The putative operator site of NiaR 
      (5'-TACWRGTGTMTWKACASYTRWAW-3') in the promoter regions of niaX, nadC, and pnuC 
      is predicted and further confirmed by promoter mutational experiments.

AB  - This study investigated the transcriptomic response of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      D39 to methionine. Transcriptome comparison of the S. pneumoniae D39 wild-type 
      grown in chemically defined medium with 0-10 mM methionine revealed the elevated 
      expression of various genes/operons involved in methionine synthesis and 
      transport (fhs, folD, gshT, metA, metB-csd, metEF, metQ, tcyB, spd-0150, spd-0431 
      and spd-0618). Furthermore, beta-galactosidase assays and quantitative RT-PCR 
      studies demonstrated that the transcriptional regulator, CmhR (SPD-0588), acts as 
      a transcriptional activator of the fhs, folD, metB-csd, metEF, metQ and spd-0431 
      genes. A putative regulatory site of CmhR was identified in the promoter region 
      of CmhR-regulated genes and this CmhR site was further confirmed by promoter 
      mutational experiments.

TI  - Piperine Triggers Apoptosis of Human Oral Squamous Carcinoma Through Cell Cycle 
      Arrest and Mitochondrial Oxidative Stress.
PG  - 791-799
LID - 10.1080/01635581.2017.1310260 [doi]
AB  - Piperine is a nitrogenous pungent substance exhibiting multifunctional 
      pharmacological properties. However, the mechanism underlying its anticancer 
      potential is not well elucidated in human oral squamous carcinoma (KB) cell line. 
      The anticancer potential of piperine was evaluated through potent biomarkers viz. 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS), cellular apoptosis, and loss of mitochondrial 
      membrane potential (MMP). In addition, cell cycle kinetics and caspases-3 
      activity were also carried out to confirm anticancer activity of piperine. 
      Results showed that various concentrations (25-300 muM) of piperine exposure 
      reduced the cell viability of KB cells significantly (P < 0.01). Piperine induced 
      significant (P < 0.01) dose-related increment in ROS production and nuclear 
      condensation. Moreover, piperine stimulated cell death by inducing loss of MMP, 
      and caspase-3 activation. Cell cycle study revealed that piperine arrested the 
      cells in G2/M phase and decreased the DNA content. Findings of this study suggest 
      the efficacy of piperine in inducing cell death via the decrease in MMP and ROS 
      liberation followed by caspase-3 activation and cell cycle arrest. Further 
      assessment of the anticancer potency of piperine is needed for anticancer drug 
      development.

AB  - Present study, was an effort to scrutinize the molecular and biochemical role of 
      ibuprofen and thiamine combination in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC in 
      Wistar rats. Single intraperitoneal injection of DEN (200 mg/kg) was used for 
      induction of HCC in rats. The rats were divided into eight various groups. DEN 
      induced rats were treated with pure ibuprofen (40 mg/kg) and thiamine in 
      combination for the period of 12th weeks. The protocol was terminated after the 
      16th week. Exposure of DEN up-regulated the levels of different serum biochemical 
      parameters, antioxidant enzyme level, Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and reduced the 
      level of High density lipoprotein (HDL) in Wistar rats along with the alteration 
      in pro-inflammatory cytokines viz., interlukin-6 (IL-6), Tumor necrosis factor 
      (TNF-alpha) and Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) with decrease in body weight. Macroscopic 
      evaluation, revealed DEN group rats confirmed the expansion of hepatic nodules, 
      which were reduced by the individual treatment of ibuprofen and thiamine, but the 
      synergistic treatment of ibuprofen and thiamine confirm the significant reduction 
      of hepatic nodules. Further, this combination possesses the significant 
      chemoprotective effect in DEN-induced HCC by restoring the hepatic enzymes and 
      other biomarkers along with an alteration in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The 
      above result concludes that ibuprofen and thiamine combination possess potent 
      anti-cancerous activity.

      cm(2) ) using a PTW 31006 ionization chamber and a scanning water tank. By 
      comparing the calculated and measured PDD results, it was seen that for larger 
      field sizes the deviation between the calculated and measured PDD was smaller. 
      Deviations between the calculated and measured results were found to be higher in 
      the build-up regions of the 6 and 15 MV photon beams. For the statistical 
      analyses, t-tests were performed using the measured and calculated PDDs for each 
      field size but showed insignificant deviations for the 6 and 15 MV photon beams. 
      The mean t-test values are 0.952 and 0.970 for the 6 and 15 MV photon beams, 
      respectively. The difference between the calculated and measured PDD is within 
      the acceptable range according to the ICRU reports (ICRU Report No. 24, 1976). We 
      conclude that accurate calculation of the PDD using the measured TMR data is 
      possible, which is useful as the PDD cannot be measured directly.

TI  - Poster - Thur Eve - 60: Physical and dynamic wedges in radiotherapy for rectal 
      cancer: A dosimetric comparison.
PG  - 4636
LID - 10.1118/1.4740168 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the dosimetry of the physical wedge (PW) and 
      enhanced dynamic wedge (EDW) in radiotherapy of rectal cancer. Two wedge angles 
      of 45 degrees  and 60 degrees  were used in the comparison due to the size of the pelvis contour. 
      6 and 15 MV photon beams produced from a Varian 21 CD linear accelerator were 
      used. Thirty rectum patients were investigated using the three-field technique. 
      Treatment plans using the PWs and EDWs were created using the Eclipse treatment 
      planning system. Monitor units, plan normalization value, maximum and minimum 
      doses in the planning target volume (PTV), dose conformity index, dose 
      homogeneity index and uniformity index were determined for each treatment plan. 
      The average dose coverage for the PTV with EDW and PW plans were compared. The 
      PTV received prescription doses of 100.9+/-0.74%, 101.01+/-1.63% for the EDW (45 degrees , 
      60 degrees ) compared to 101.2+/-1.65%, 101.3+/-1.33% for the PW (45 degrees , 60 degrees ). Homogeneity 
      indices were (0.11+/-0.02%, 0.11+/-0.05%) for the EDW (45 degrees , 60 degrees ), and (0.15+/-0.1%, 
      0.16+/-0.11%) for the PW (45 degrees , 60 degrees ), respectively. The EDW at 45 degrees  had better target 
      coverage with higher conformity index value of 0.98 +/- 0.01 compared to the other 
      wedges. A statistically significant (p < 0.01) change in plan normalization 
      values and fewer monitor units were found using the EDW at 45 degrees . We conclude that 
      the EDW at 45 degrees  results in an improvement to the plan evaluation parameters 
      presented and thus increases dose efficacy for radiotherapy of rectal cancer.

AB  - Tuberculosis is one of the top ten causes of deaths worldwide. The cause of 
      tuberculosis is a bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has been surviving 
      for centuries. Immunological tests based on detecting the presence of antibodies 
      in the sera of active TB patients against various antigens of M. tuberculosis are 
      useful for diagnosis of TB and offer simple, rapid and cost effective methods 
      most suitable for poor and developing countries. Several recombinant antigens 
      have been reported so far with varying sensitivity individually, yet none had 
      shown sensitivity higher enough to be used in a commercial test. There is a trend 
      of utilizing recombinant DNA technology to make polypeptide chain with two or 
      more different antigenic regions, in order to increase the diagnostic efficiency. 
      In this review, we have made an attempt to combine current studies on the 
      usefulness of the multi-component Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens in 
      serological tests for the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

AB  - Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; MIM-212780) is a rare autosomal recessive 
      limb malformation characterized by complete osseous fusion of all fingers and 
      toes, disorganization of phalangeal elements and severe shortening of the radius 
      and ulna. It is occasionally associated with renal hypoplasia, oro-facial 
      defects, scoliosis of the thoracic spine, hearing loss, and genital anomalies. 
      Here we describe a consanguineous Pakistani kindred with a severe form of CLSS 
      characterized by complete syndactyly and disorganization of fingers, 
      oligo-syndactyly of toes, shortening of limbs, frontal bossing, and 
      hypoplasia/agenesis of left kidney. The affected individuals were additionally 
      presented with short stature, cleft-lip and hypoplastic shoulder joint with 
      restricted upper limb movement. A novel splice variant in LRP4 (c.316+1G > A) 
      segregated with the phenotype in a five generations family. The mutation is 
      predicted to add 29 non-native amino acids with a premature termination, 
      resulting in approximately 90% length reduction of the wild-type transcript. 
      These findings not only further expand the phenotypic variability of CLSS but 
      also indicate that early truncated and loss-of-function mutations in LRP4 lead to 
      a more severe CLSS phenotype.

BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Septic or suppurative thrombophlebitis (STP) is defined by the presence of an 
      endovascular thrombus in the setting of associated bacterial or fungal infection. 
      Venous infections can arise from an associated intravenous catheter, skin 
      breakdown, or by invasion from adjacent nonvascular structures. Although this 
      process can occur in both superficial and deep vessels of the body, it is seen 
      most commonly in venous structures (e.g., peripheral veins, pelvic veins, 
      superior vena cava, internal jugular vein, portal veins or dural sinuses). The 
      patient presentation may vary from a mild infection of the superficial veins to a 
      severe, systemic infection. Once STP is present, several complications related to 
      the hematogenous bacterial spread and septic thromboembolism may develop, such as 
      endocarditis, septic arthritis, and even septic uveitis. The morbidity and 
      mortality of STP if not treated, is high, although the risk of significant 
      morbidity and mortality depends on the location of the thrombus.

AB  - The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) is a promising approach for the remediation 
      of wastewater. The present study aims to develop a plant-bacteria system within 
      CWs for the efficient remediation of tannery effluent. In a vertical-flow CW 
      vegetated with Leptochloa fusca (Kallar grass), a consortium of three different 
      endophytic bacteria, Pantoea stewartii ASI11, Microbacterium arborescens HU33, 
      and Enterobacter sp. HU38, was used for bioaugmentation. CWs vegetated with only 
      L. fusca had the potential to remediate tannery effluent, but augmentation with 
      endophytic bacteria enhanced the growth of L. fusca while aiding in the removal 
      of both organic and inorganic pollutants from the tannery effluent. Moreover, the 
      bacterial augmentation decreased toxicity in the effluent as well. A higher 
      number of chromium (Cr)-resistant bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere and 
      endosphere of L. fusca inoculated with the endophytes than from uninoculated 
      plants. Due to promising bioremediation and detoxification potential of L. fusca, 
      it is reported for the first time as a potential candidate to develop effective 
      CWs for the remediation of polluted effluents in combination with 
      pollutant-degrading endophytic bacteria.

TI  - Progressive SCAR14 with unclear speech, developmental delay, tremor, and

      homology domain.
PG  - 2494-2499
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.38332 [doi]
AB  - We report on nine members of a consanguineous Pakistani family with primary 
      presentation of intellectual disability, developmental delay, limb and gait 
      ataxia, behavioral and speech problems, and tremor. By linkage mapping and exome 
      sequencing we identified novel homozygous splicing variant c.6375-1G>C in SPTBN2. 
      To date, only two other SPTBN2 mutations with recessive pattern of inheritance 
      causing SCAR14 (spinocerebellar ataxia, autosomal recessive 14) that manifest 
      with developmental ataxia and cognitive impairment, or cerebellar ataxia, mental 
      retardation, and pyramidal signs have been reported. The mutation we identified 
      is predicted to lead to the deletion of just the pleckstrin homology domain; 
      thus, the earlier onset and more progressive nature of the disease in the 
      presented family, as compared to earlier reports, were unexpected. No other 
      mutation that could possibly explain the features that were unusual for 
      SCAR14-arched palate, limb hypotonia, climacophobia, and behavioral problems-was 
      identified. The disease was more severe in males than females. Our findings 
      expand the recessive SPTBN2 mutation phenotype. We also review SPTBN2 mutation 
      phenotypes. The gene encodes beta-III spectrin, which forms tetramers with 
      alpha-II spectrin. The manifestations of this third recessive mutation suggest 
      that for recessive mutations either no mutant protein is synthesized because the 
      transcript is subject to nonsense-mediated decay or the mutant protein does not 
      bind membrane proteins and, thus, does not exert a negative effect in 
      heterozygotes, whereas the dominant mutations causing SCA5 form defective 
      tetramers that compete with the native tetramers in binding membrane proteins, 
      but are unable to anchor them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic subdural haematoma (CSDH) is one of the most commonly treated 
      condition in neurosurgery. It affects elderly populations who often have 
      significant medical co-morbidities resulting in poor prognosis. The study aimed 
      at identifying clinical factors influencing the survival following surgical 
      management of CSDH. METHODS: Retrospective study included 267 cases that 
      underwent surgery for CSDH and followed over 5-year period (2010-2015); data 
      retrieved with reference to operation details, radiology reports and discharge. 
      Using logistic and Cox regression analysis, the patient survival data was 
      analysed with respect to patient demographics, type of surgery, co-morbidities, 
      anticoagulation treatment, and discharge destination. RESULTS: The overall 
      survival in the cohort was 37.0months (IQR: 20.0-60.0). The median age of the 
      patients was 76years (IQR: 66-82) and the median length of hospital stay was 
      10days (range 1-126days; IQR: 6-17days). The recurrence rate was 6.37% (n=17). 
      Fifty-three (19.85%) patients recorded deceased on the IPM database as of October 
      2016 and of those 11 died in hospital. Univariate Cox-regression analysis 
      revealed increased age (HR: 1.80; 95%CI: 1.04-3.11), length of hospital stay (HR: 
      2.50; 95%CI: 1.41-4.41) and number of co-morbidities (HR: 2.19; 95%CI: 1.26-3.79) 
      were associated with poor prognosis. Glasgow coma scale (GCS) at discharge was 
      found to be significantly associated with survival whilst anticoagulation 
      treatment did not. Multivariate analysis confirmed similar findings significant 
      statistically. CONCLUSION: Age at admission, median length of hospital stay, 
      number of co-morbidities, GCS at discharge and discharge destination have been 
      found to influence survival significant statistically.

AB  - Processing huge repository of medical literature for extracting relevant and 
      high-quality evidences demands efficient evidence support methods. We aim at 
      developing methods to automate the process of finding quality evidences from a 
      plethora of literature documents and grade them according to the context (local 
      condition). We propose a two-level methodology for quality recognition and 
      grading of evidences. First, quality is recognized using quality recognition 
      model; second, context-aware grading of evidences is accomplished. Using 10-fold 
      cross-validation, the proposed quality recognition model achieved an accuracy of 
      92.14 percent and improved the baseline system accuracy by about 24 percent. The 
      proposed context-aware grading method graded 808 out of 1354 test evidences as 
      highly beneficial for treatment purpose. This infers that around 60 percent 
      evidences shall be given more importance as compared to the other 40 percent 
      evidences. The inclusion of context in recommendation of evidence makes the 
      process of evidence-based decision-making "situation-aware."

AB  - Lipase (E.C.3.1.1.3) belongs to the hydrolases and is also known as fat 
      splitting, glycerol ester hydrolase or triacylglycerol acylhydrolase. Lipase 
      catalyzes the hydrolysis of triglycerides converting them to glycerol and fatty 
      acids in an oil-water interface. These are widely used in food, dairy, flavor, 
      pharmaceuticals, biofuels, leather, cosmetics, detergent, and chemical 
      industries. Lipases are of plant, animal, and microbial origin, but microbial 
      lipases are produced at industrial level and represent the most widely used class 
      of enzymes in biotechnological applications and organic chemistry. Phylogenetic 
      analysis and comparison of residues around GxSxG motif provided an insight to the 
      diversity among bacterial lipases. A variety of para-Nitrophenyl (p-NP) esters 
      having C(2) to C(16) (p-NP acetate to p-NP palmitate) in their fatty acid side 
      chain can be hydrolyzed by bacterial lipases. Large heterogeneity has been 
      observed in molecular and catalytic characteristics of lipases including 
      molecular mass; 19-96 kDa, K(m); 0.0064-16.58 mM, K(cat); 0.1665-1.0 x 10(4) 
      s(-1) and K(cat)/K(m); 26.02-7377 s(-1)/mM. Optimal conditions of their working 
      temperature and pH have been stated 15-70  degrees C and 5.0-10.8, respectively and are 
      strongly associated with the type and growth conditions of bacteria. Surface 
      hydrophobicity, enzyme activity, stability in organic solvents and at high 
      temperature, proteolytic resistance and substrate tolerance are the properties of 
      bacterial lipases that have been improved by engineering. Bacterial lipases have 
      been extensively studied during last decade. However, their wider applications 
      demand a detailed review on purification, catalytic characterization and 
      applications of lipases.

TI  - Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of meniscal surgery compared 
      with exercise and patient education for treatment of meniscal tears in young 
      adults.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Arthroscopic surgery is a very common orthopaedic procedure. While 
      several trials have investigated the effect of knee arthroscopy for middle-aged 
      and older patients with meniscal tears, there is a paucity of trials comparing 
      meniscal surgery with non-surgical treatment for younger adults. The aim of this 
      randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to investigate if early arthroscopic surgery 
      is superior to exercise therapy and education, with the option of later surgery 
      if needed, in improving pain, function and quality of life in younger adults with 
      meniscal tears. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a multicentre, 
      parallel-group RCT conducted at six hospitals across all five healthcare regions 
      in Denmark. 140 patients aged 18-40 years with a clinical history and symptoms 
      consistent with a meniscal tear, verified on MRI, found eligible for meniscal 
      surgery by an orthopaedic surgeon will be randomly allocated to one of two groups 
      (1:1 ratio). Participants randomised to surgery will undergo either arthroscopic 
      partial meniscectomy or meniscal repair followed by standard postsurgical care, 
      while participants allocated to exercise and education will undergo a 12-week 
      individualised, supervised neuromuscular and strengthening exercise programme and 
      patient education. The primary outcome will be difference in change from baseline 
      to 12 months in the mean score on four Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome 
      Score subscales, covering pain, symptoms, function in sports and recreation and 
      quality of life (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS(4))) 
      supported by the individual subscale scores allowing clinical interpretation. 
      Alongside, the RCT an observational cohort will follow patients aged 18-40 years 
      with clinical suspicion of a meniscal tear, but not fully eligible or declining 
      to participate in the trial. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Results will be presented 
      in peer-reviewed journals and at international conferences. This study is 
      approved by the Regional Committees on Health Research Ethics for Southern 
      Denmark. REGISTRATION DETAILS: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02995551).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Technologically integrated healthcare environments can be realized if 
      physicians are encouraged to use smart systems for the creation and sharing of 
      knowledge used in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). While CDSSs are 
      heading toward smart environments, they lack support for abstraction of 
      technology-oriented knowledge from physicians. Therefore, abstraction in the form 
      of a user-friendly and flexible authoring environment is required in order for 
      physicians to create shareable and interoperable knowledge for CDSS workflows. 
      Our proposed system provides a user-friendly authoring environment to create 
      Arden Syntax MLM (Medical Logic Module) as shareable knowledge rules for 
      intelligent decision-making by CDSS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Existing systems are 
      not physician friendly and lack interoperability and shareability of knowledge. 
      In this paper, we proposed Intelligent-Knowledge Authoring Tool (I-KAT), a 
      knowledge authoring environment that overcomes the above mentioned limitations. 
      Shareability is achieved by creating a knowledge base from MLMs using Arden 
      Syntax. Interoperability is enhanced using standard data models and 
      terminologies. However, creation of shareable and interoperable knowledge using 
      Arden Syntax without abstraction increases complexity, which ultimately makes it 
      difficult for physicians to use the authoring environment. Therefore, physician 
      friendliness is provided by abstraction at the application layer to reduce 
      complexity. This abstraction is regulated by mappings created between legacy 
      system concepts, which are modeled as domain clinical model (DCM) and decision 
      support standards such as virtual medical record (vMR) and Systematized 
      Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). We represent these 
      mappings with a semantic reconciliation model (SRM). RESULTS: The objective of 
      the study is the creation of shareable and interoperable knowledge using a 
      user-friendly and flexible I-KAT. Therefore we evaluated our system using 
      completeness and user satisfaction criteria, which we assessed through the 
      system- and user-centric evaluation processes. For system-centric evaluation, we 
      compared the implementation of clinical information modelling system requirements 
      in our proposed system and in existing systems. The results suggested that 82.05% 
      of the requirements were fully supported, 7.69% were partially supported, and 
      10.25% were not supported by our system. In the existing systems, 35.89% of 
      requirements were fully supported, 28.20% were partially supported, and 35.89% 
      were not supported. For user-centric evaluation, the assessment criterion was 
      'ease of use'. Our proposed system showed 15 times better results with respect to 
      MLM creation time than the existing systems. Moreover, on average, the 
      participants made only one error in MLM creation using our proposed system, but 
      13 errors per MLM using the existing systems. CONCLUSION: We provide a 
      user-friendly authoring environment for creation of shareable and interoperable 
      knowledge for CDSS to overcome knowledge acquisition complexity. The authoring 
      environment uses state-of-the-art decision support-related clinical standards 
      with increased ease of use.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Lantana camara is a popular invasive weed 
      utilized in the management of ulcer in different part of world. Study of specific 
      compound present in this plant responsible for their antulcer activity is main 
      topic of concern. Current study designed for evaluation of the antiulcer activity 
      of oleane-12-en-3beta-ol-28-oic acid 3beta-D-glucopyranoside (OAG) from Lantana camara 
      L. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiulcer activity was carried out on NSAID's (Aspirin) 
      and ethanol induced ulcer model. The efficacy of the OAG on ulcer index, 
      percentage protection and gastric acid secretion were evaluated. RESULTS: Ulcer 
      protection percentage (38.37%) was significant (P < 0.001) higher in the groups 
      treated with the higher OAG dose (50mg/kg), it also recover the mucosa with no 
      redness, no inflammation, mild dilation of blood vessels. OAG significantly (P < 
      0.01 and P < 0.001) reduce acidity, free acidity and gastric acid volume. It also 
      significantly (P < 0.01) increases the pH of stomach. CONCLUSION: On the basis of 
      results, it can be concluded that OAG shows significant gastroprotective activity 
      by gastric acid secretion inhibition and afford protection against gastric 
      mucosal damage. Further increase of prostaglandin E2 level establishes the 
      mechanism of antiulcer activity of OAG.

AB  - We report the laboratory analysis of 125 clinical samples from suspected cases of 
      foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in cattle and Asian buffalo collected in Pakistan 
      between 2008 and 2012. Of these samples, 89 were found to contain viral RNA by 
      rRT-PCR, of which 88 were also found to contain infectious FMD virus (FMDV) by 
      virus isolation (VI), with strong correlation between these tests (kappa = 0.96). 
      Samples that were VI-positive were serotyped by antigen detection ELISA 
      (Ag-ELISA) and VP1 sequence acquisition and analysis. Sequence data identified 
      FMDV serotypes A (n = 13), O (n = 36) and Asia-1 (n = 41), including three 
      samples from which both serotypes Asia-1 and O were detected. Serotype A viruses 
      were classified within three different Iran-05 sublineages: HER-10, FAR-11 and 
      ESF-10. All serotype Asia-1 were within Group VII (Sindh-08 lineage), in a 
      genetic clade that differs from viruses isolated prior to 2010. All serotypes O 
      were classified as PanAsia-2 within two different sublineages: ANT-10 and BAL-09. 
      Using VP1 sequencing as the gold standard for serotype determination, the overall 
      sensitivity of Ag-ELISA to correctly determine serotype was 74%, and 
      serotype-specific sensitivity was 8% for serotype A, 88% for Asia-1 and 89% for 
      O. Serotype-specific specificity was 100% for serotype A, 93% for Asia-1 and 94% 
      for O. Interestingly, 12 of 13 serotype A viruses were not detected by Ag-ELISA. 
      This study confirms earlier accounts of regional genetic diversity of FMDV in 
      Pakistan and highlights the importance of continued validation of diagnostic 
      tests for rapidly evolving pathogens such as FMDV.

TI  - Child Abuse and Neglect.

AB  - Child maltreatment, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), includes 
      physical, emotional, or sexual abuse, as well as neglect and exploitation, that 
      can harm or threaten a child's health, development, or dignity. These acts occur 
      within relationships characterized by responsibility, trust, or power. Abuse 
      is considered an act of commission, while neglect is an act of omission in the 
      care of a child, potentially leading to actual harm.  A comprehensive approach to 
      understanding child abuse involves examining its risk factors, epidemiology, 
      diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, while highlighting the critical role of the 
      interprofessional healthcare team in managing this adverse childhood experience, 
      which can have lifelong physical and psychological consequences. As abuse and 
      neglect may be perpetrated by parents, family members, acquaintances, teachers, 
      coaches, clergy, and other adults, the term "caregiver" will be used to refer to 
      adults responsible for a child's welfare. Caring for abused and neglected 
      children presents a significant challenge for clinicians, but advocating for 
      these children can save lives and reduce the risk of associated complications. 
      Healthcare providers must remain vigilant and maintain a high index of suspicion 
      to ensure the early and accurate detection of child neglect or abuse. Neglect is 
      the most prevalent form of child maltreatment, substantiated in over half of 
      confirmed cases. This accounts for nearly 3-quarters of child fatalities 
      resulting from maltreatment, including incidents like drowning, home fires, and 
      being left unattended in hot vehicles. Neglect involves the failure to provide 
      adequate healthcare, supervision, protection from environmental hazards, and 
      basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. Emotional neglect occurs 
      when children are exposed to family or intimate partner violence or substance 
      abuse. Educational neglect is evident through truancy or failure to comply with 
      school enrollment requirements. Physical abuse includes actions such as beating, 
      shaking, burning, and biting. The distinction between corporal punishment and 
      abuse often remains ambiguous and may vary with cultural norms. Rib fractures are 
      the most common injuries associated with physical abuse, but the spectrum of 
      injuries includes severe abdominal and head injuries, which may be fatal. 
      Psychological or emotional abuse involves repeated behavioral patterns that 
      humiliate, demean, or frighten a child, potentially leading to lifelong 
      psychological disorders. The absence of physical findings makes detection more 
      challenging than with physical abuse, and its identification may depend on 
      interpretation and context. The distinction between suboptimal parenting and 
      abuse can be unclear, making it difficult to determine when it crosses into 
      abuse. Sexual abuse is defined as "the involvement of dependent, developmentally 
      immature children and adolescents in sexual activities that they do not fully 
      comprehend, to which they are unable to give consent, or that violate the social 
      taboos of family roles." Sexual abuse does not necessarily involve oral, anal, or 
      vaginal penetration. This includes exposure to sexually explicit materials, 
      oral-genital contact, genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and 
      genital fondling. Sexual abuse is an underreported public health issue that can 
      potentially lead to long-term medical and psychological consequences. The Centers 
      for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 
      boys may experience sexual abuse. In 90% of cases, the perpetrator is known to 
      the family. Confirming sexual abuse can be challenging, as a normal or negative 
      physical examination does not rule out its occurrence. Please see StatPearls 
      companion resource, "Child Sexual Abuse and Neglect," for more information.

AB  - Evaluation of diphenhydramine in talc induced type 2 diabetes mellitus was done 
      in Wistar rats. Oral administration of Talc (10mg/kg)carried out for 21days 
      increased the levels of serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT), glutamate 
      oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT), serum creatinine, blood glucose, urea, uric 
      acid and triglycerides (TGs), but when the animals were treated with 
      diphenhydramine (DPH), the levels of the aforementioned biochemical parameters 
      decreased significantly (p<0.0001). The level of serum cholesterol and high 
      density lipoprotein (HDL) was found to be reduced in Diabetes Mellitus (DM) 
      control and when it was treated with DPH control animals, these makers increased 
      significantly. The study done on DM and Diphenhydramine suggests that Talc 
      increases the blood glucose level at a dose of 10mg/kg (0.14gm) and 
      Diphenhydramine (1mg/kg)reduces the increased blood glucose level. These finding 
      simply that diphenhydramine may be useful in the management of talc induced 
      diabetes.

TI  - International validation of the European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
      of Cancer QLQ-BRECON23 quality-of-life questionnaire for women undergoing breast 
      reconstruction.
PG  - 209-222
LID - 10.1002/bjs.10656 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim was to carry out phase 4 international field-testing of the 
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) breast 
      reconstruction (BRECON) module. The primary objective was finalization of its 
      scale structure. Secondary objectives were evaluation of its reliability, 
      validity, responsiveness, acceptability and interpretability in patients with 
      breast cancer undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction. METHODS: The EORTC module 
      development guidelines were followed. Patients were recruited from 28 centres in 
      seven countries. A prospective cohort completed the QLQ-BRECON15 before 
      mastectomy and the QLQ-BRECON24 at 4-8 months after reconstruction. The 
      cross-sectional cohort completed the QLQ-BRECON24 at 1-5 years after 
      reconstruction, and repeated this 2-8 weeks later (test-retest reliability). All 
      participants completed debriefing questionnaires. RESULTS: A total of 438 
      patients were recruited, 234 in the prospective cohort and 204 in the 
      cross-sectional cohort. A total of 414 reconstructions were immediate, with a 
      comparable number of implants (176) and donor-site flaps (166). Control groups 
      comprised patients who underwent two-stage implant procedures (72, 75 per cent) 
      or delayed reconstruction (24, 25 per cent). Psychometric scale validity was 
      supported by moderate to high item-own scale and item-total correlations (over 
      0.5). Questionnaire validity was confirmed by good scale-to-sample targeting, and 
      computable scale scores exceeding 50 per cent, except nipple cosmesis (over 40 
      per cent). In known-group comparisons, QLQ-BRECON24 scales and items 
      differentiated between patient groups defined by clinical criteria, such as type 
      and timing of reconstruction, postmastectomy radiotherapy and surgical 
      complications, with moderate effect sizes. Prospectively, sexuality and surgical 
      side-effects scales showed significant responsiveness over time (P < 0.001). 
      Scale reliability was supported by high Cronbach's alpha coefficients (over 0.7) and 
      test-retest (intraclass correlation more than 0.8). One item (finding a well 
      fitting bra) was excluded based on high floor/ceiling effects, poor test-retest 
      and weak correlations in factor analysis (below 0.3), thus generating the 
      QLQ-BRECON23 questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The QLQ-BRECON23 is an internationally 
      validated tool to be used alongside the EORTC QLQ-C30 (cancer) and QLQ-BR23 
      (breast cancer) questionnaires for evaluating quality of life and satisfaction 
      after breast reconstruction.

TI  - Homozygous mutation in CEP19, a gene mutated in morbid obesity, in Bardet-Biedl 
      syndrome with predominant postaxial polydactyly.
PG  - 189-197
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104758 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy with extensive phenotypic 
      variability and genetic heterogeneity. We aimed to discover the gene mutated in a 
      consanguineous kindred with multiple cases of a BBS phenotype. METHODS: SNP 
      genotype data were used for linkage analysis and exome sequencing to identify 
      mutations. Modelling and in silico analysis were performed to predict mutation 
      severity. RESULTS: Patients had postaxial polydactyly plus variable other 
      clinical features including rod-cone dystrophy, obesity, intellectual disability, 
      renal malformation, developmental delay, dental anomalies, speech disorder and 
      enlarged fatty liver. The 4.57 Mb disease locus harboured homozygous, truncating 
      CEP19 c.194_195insA (p.Tyr65*) mutation. We also found glioma-associated oncogene 
      homolog 1(GLI1) c.820G>C (p.Gly274Arg) in the homozygous state in most patients. 
      In silico modelling strongly suggests that it is damaging. Also, different 
      combinations of four possible modifier alleles in BBS-related genes were 
      detected. Two are known modifier alleles for BBS, splicing variant CCDC28B 
      c.330C>T and missense MKKS/BBS6 p.Ile339Val, and the others are C8ORF37/BBS21 
      p.Ala178Val and TMEM67/BBS14 modifier p.Asp799Asp. Some patients carry all those 
      five known/possible modifier alleles. Such variants are highly significantly more 
      abundant in our patients than in a control group. CONCLUSION: CEP19 encodes a 
      centrosomal and ciliary protein, as all BBS genes do. Another truncating mutation 
      p.Arg82* has been reported as responsible for morbid obesity in a family; 
      however, in the family we present, not all homozygotes are obese, although some 
      are severely obese. The variant in GLI1, encoding a transcription factor that 
      localises to the primary cilium and nucleus and is a mediator of the sonic 
      hedgehog pathway, possibly exacerbates disease severity when in the homozygous 
      state.

TI  - Acoustic Wave-Driven Functionalized Particles for Aptamer-Based Target 
      Biomolecule Separation.
PG  - 13313-13319
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.7b03474 [doi]
AB  - We developed a hybrid microfluidic device that utilized acoustic waves to drive 
      functionalized microparticles inside a continuous flow microchannel and to 
      separate particle-conjugated target proteins from a complex fluid. The 
      acoustofluidic device is composed of an interdigitated transducer that produces 
      high-frequency surface acoustic waves (SAW) and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
      microfluidic channel. The SAW interacted with the sample fluid inside the 
      microchannel and deflected particles from their original streamlines to achieve 
      separation. Streptavidin-functionalized polystyrene (PS) microparticles were used 
      to capture aptamer (single-stranded DNA) labeled at one end with a biotin 
      molecule. The free end of the customized aptamer15 (apt15), which was attached to 
      the microparticles via streptavidin-biotin linkage to form the PS-apt15 
      conjugate, was used to capture the model target protein, thrombin (th), by 
      binding at exosite I to form the PS-apt15-th complex. We demonstrated that the 
      PS-apt15 conjugate selectively captured thrombin molecules in a complex fluid. 
      After the PS-apt15-th complex was formed, the sample fluid was pumped through a 
      PDMS microchannel along with two buffer sheath flows that hydrodynamically 
      focused the sample flow prior to SAW exposure for PS-apt15-th separation from the 
      non-target proteins. We successfully separated thrombin from mCardinal2 and human 
      serum using the proposed acoustofluidic device.

AB  - A 32-year-old female presented to the emergency department with complaints of 
      diplopia, followed by dyspnea, chest tightness, congestion, and dysphagia. The 
      patient was resuscitated and initial investigations were done. Within a few hours 
      of the admission, she started developing signs of respiratory failure and was 
      intubated and placed on the mechanical ventilator. The patient denied any 
      ingestion of exotic food, shellfish, raw meat, or raw fish. The patient also 
      denied traveling to any exotic place or recent camping trips. The 
      edrophonium tensilon test and lumbar puncture came out to be negative. The 
      botulinum toxin test was positive, the patient was started on botulinum 
      antitoxin, and the rest of symptomatic treatment was continued. The Centre for 
      Disease Control (CDC) tracked the events related to the presentation and found 
      she had eaten nacho cheese from a gas station the day before the appearance of 
      the symptoms. A total of 10 cases were associated with this source within days 
      and one death was reported.

TI  - An effective and doable interventional strategy to enhance vaccination coverage - 
      are we ready to change?
PG  - 1719-1722
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of patient reminder calls on improvement of 
      routine vaccination coverage. METHODS: This prospective, interventional study was 
      conducted at Rawal Institute of Health Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, from 
      December 2014 to August 2016, and comprised babies enrolled at the time of 1st 
      vaccination. Babies who were given bacillus Calmette-Guerin, oral polio vaccine 
      were included. Mobile phone numbers of parents were noted. The 1st reminder call 
      was given after 7 days if a baby did not report on the scheduled date. Similarly, 
      2nd and 3rd reminder calls were made after waiting for 7 days each time in case 
      of non-reporting. Record of reporting and reminder calls was reviewed daily till 
      all the enrolled babies crossed 15 months of age (scheduled time for 2nd dose of 
      measles) plus 4 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 150 babies were enrolled at the time 
      of 1st vaccination. Reporting without call within 01 week of scheduled date 
      ranged from 52(34.66%) to 99(66%) for different vaccines. The 1st reminder call 
      showed maximum improvement in reporting rate. The range of vaccination rate 
      reached from 91(60.66%) to 132(88%). The 2nd call improved coverage rate range 
      from 108(71.99%) to 140(93.33%). The 3rd call improved coverage rate from 
      113(75.32%) to 144(96%). Overall coverage rate achieved ranged from 112.5(75%) to 
      144(96%). CONCLUSIONS: Patient reminder calls showed significant effect in 
      improvement of vaccination coverage rate of all antigens.

TI  - Diagnosis of hepatitis C in pregnant mothers and its transfer pattern in 
      neonates.
PG  - 2253-2257
AB  - Hepatitis is the most common liver diseases in the Pakistan caused by blood-borne 
      infection of HCV. Viral transmission is frequent through blood contact. Vertical 
      transmission is transfer of disease from mother to infant. The women who are 
      infected with hepatitis C virus RNA are at high risk of infecting their babies. 
      Actual transmission occurs during labor and at time of delivery when blood of 
      both mother and neonate is in contact with each other. Vertical transmission rate 
      is lowered when mother is HCV RN A negative. The project was designed to 
      determine the percentage of transmission and prevalence of Hepatitis C virus from 
      mother to neonates. Assessment of the quantitative analysis of RNA levels in 
      mother blood and viraemic status from the early postpartum period onwards of 
      children born to HCV infected mothers. For the diagnosis of hepatitis C in 
      mothers, blood samples of fifty HCV pregnant women between 23-41 years old were 
      taken. The blood samples were centrifuged at 8,000 rpm and serum was separated 
      and stored at 40C. The values of the Alanine Aminotransferase was determined at 
      2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy. After extraction HCVRN Awere transcribed and 
      amplified by PCR. The samples were further authenticated through the Agarose Gel 
      Electrophoresis system and bands were obtained. Nested reverse transcription PCR 
      (RT-PCR) was conducted for the quantitative analysis of HCV-RNA. The results 
      showed that in 66% cases, the mothers had high level of ALT at 2nd trimester of 
      pregnancy. Their ALT level was decreased in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy. PCR 
      results showed that 40% pregnant women had quantity of HCV-RNA in the range of 
      1000-10,000 IU/mL and in 18% women were above 100000 The results of 
      spectrophotometer showed that 80% infants had the antibodies against HCV-RNA 
      while only 20% of the neonates did not have antibody right after birth. The 29% 
      babies got HCV-RNA in their serum and became positive for HCV-RNA.

TI  - Oxyphenbutazone promotes cytotoxicity in rats and Hep3B cellsvia suppression of 
      PGE(2) and deactivation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway.
PG  - 187-196

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth leading cause of death and is 
      generally typified by elevated liver enzyme biomarkers, antioxidants, and chronic 
      inflammation of hepatocytes. Although currently available drugs have shown 
      remarkable alleviation of the cancerous condition, but at the same time they 
      present a more severe challenge of toxic effects due to chemotherapy. Therefore, 
      in order to bring more patient-compliant therapy, we aimed to refurbish the use 
      of a COX inhibitor, oxyphenbutazone (OPB), with low dose of methotrexate (MTX) to 
      treat diethyl nitrosamine (DENA)-induced HCC in Wistar rats and in Hep3B cells. 
      Hep3B cells were subjected to assays like in vitro cytotoxicity, DNA synthesis, 
      and caspase activity. The combination index was also evaluated, succeeding the 
      cytotoxicity assay, to analyze the possible synergism. For in vivo study, Wistar 
      strain male rats were given single intraperitoneal dose of DENA (200 mg/kg) and 
      were supplied with sodium phenobarbital (0.1% in tap water) for promoting 
      tumorigenesis throughout the study. MTX (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg/week, ip) and OPB 
      (70 mg/kg/week, po in two divided doses) were administered to the treatment 
      groups from 3rd week till the termination of study. Several biochemical 
      parameters including biomarkers of liver function, antioxidant enzymes, and 
      histopathological examination of liver cells were tested. Significant synergism 
      was witnessed in the cytotoxicity assay when Hep3B cells received varied dose 
      combination treatment of MTX (0.25, 0.5, or 1.0 micromol/L) and OPB (2.5, 5.0, or 
      7.5 micromol/L). MTX (0.5 and 1.0 micromol/L) in combination with OPB (5.0 or 7.5 micromol/L) 
      inhibited the cell proliferation as BrdU incorporation was quite low in DNA 
      synthesis analysis, as well as caspase-9/-3 cascade was activated which led to 
      apoptosis of cancer cells. Co-treatment with MTX and OPB exerted potential 
      anticancer activity in rats than either of the drugs alone. Administration of 
      combination therapy harmonized the DENA-induced elevation of serum biochemical 
      parameters, including but not limited to, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), alanine- and 
      aspartate-aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, vascular endothelial growth 
      factor (VEGF), and antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase 
      (CAT), and lipid per oxidation (LPO). All these results were optimally 
      substantiated by histopathological examination. As evident COX-2 catalyzes the 
      synthesis of PGE(2), needed in the activation of Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, which in 
      turn is responsible for activating the transcriptional proteins required for 
      higher degree of cell division and thence growth. Therefore, inhibition of COX-2 
      by our novel combination infers that even low doses of MTX can elucidate 
      noticeable anticancer activity when paired with OPB.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Expert opinion recommends performing exercise testing with initiation 
      of Class Ic antiarrhythmic medication. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the rate and reason 
      for discontinuation of Ic agent within the first year of follow up, with 
      particular attention to rate of proarrhythmia and the value of routine treadmill 
      testing. METHODS: This is a single center retrospective cohort study including 
      consecutive patients with atrial arrhythmias who were initiated on a Class Ic 
      agent from 2011 to 2016. Data was collated from chart review and pharmacy 
      database. RESULTS: The study population included 300 patients (55% male, mean age 
      61; mean ejection fraction, 56%) started on flecainide (n = 153; 51%) and 
      propafenone (n = 147; 49%). Drug initiation was completed while hospitalized on 
      telemetry and the staff electrophysiologists directed dosing. There was one 
      proarrhythmic event during initiation (0.3%). The primary reason for not being 
      discharged on Ic agent was due to detection of proarrhythmia (n = 15) or ischemia 
      (n = 1) with treadmill testing (5.3%). Exercise testing was the single 
      significant variable to affect the decision to discontinue Ic drug, p < 0.0001 
      (95% CI: 1.89-6.08%). During follow up, the primary reason for discontinuation of 
      Ic agent was lack of efficacy, 32%. CONCLUSIONS: With proper screening, 
      initiation of Class Ic agent is associated with very low rate of proarrhythmia. 
      Treadmill testing is of incremental value and should be completed in all patients 
      after loading Class Ic antiarrhythmic.

TI  - Augmentation with potential endophytes enhances phytostabilization of Cr in 
      contaminated soil.

AB  - The contamination of soil with heavy metals is a major environmental problem 
      worldwide. The combined use of plants and their associated microbes has gained 
      popularity in recent years for their potential to remediate heavy 
      metal-contaminated soil. In the current study, the effect that augmentation of 
      soil with plant growth-promoting endophytes has on the phytostabilization of 
      chromium (Cr)-contaminated soil was investigated. Three potential endophytic 
      bacterial strains (Enterobacter sp. HU38, Microbacterium arborescens HU33, and 
      Pantoea stewartii ASI11) were inoculated individually as well as in combination 
      to Leptochloa fusca and Brachiaria mutica vegetated in Cr-contaminated soil. The 
      accumulation of Cr in the root and shoot of the plants was determined. Moreover, 
      bacterial persistence in the rhizosphere and endosphere was determined. 
      Augmentation with potential endophytes significantly increased root length 
      (24-45%), shoot height (39-64%), chlorophyll content (20-55%), and the overall 
      biomass (32-61%) of the plants. Although L. fusca and B. mutica showed potential 
      to accumulate Cr in their root and shoot, endophytic augmentation increased 
      uptake, translocation, and accumulation of Cr in the roots and shoots of both 
      plant species. However, L. fusca showed more potential to phytostabilize Cr as 
      compared to B. mutica. Furthermore, the potential endophytes showed more survival 
      and persistence within the roots than in the rhizosphere and shoot interior. This 
      study provides useful evidence of endophyte-assisted phytoremediation to be the 
      most sustainable and affordable approach for in situ remediation of 
      Cr-contaminated soil.

AB  - We report a novel strategy for the fabrication of lecithin-coated gold 
      nanoflowers (GNFs) via single-step design for CT imaging application. 
      Field-emission electron microscope confirmed flowers like morphology of the 
      as-synthesized nanostructures. Furthermore, these show absorption peak in 
      near-infrared (NIR) region at lambda(max) 690 nm Different concentrations of GNFs are 
      tested as a contrast agent in CT scans at tube voltage 135 kV and tube current 
      350 mA. These results are compared with same amount of iodine at same CT scan 
      parameters. The results of in vitro CT scan study show that GNFs have good 
      contrast enhancement properties, whereas in vivo study of rabbits CT scan shows 
      that GNFs enhance the CT image clearly at 135 kV as compared to that of iodine. 
      Cytotoxicity was studied and blood profile show minor increase of white blood 
      cells and haemoglobin, whereas decrease of red blood cells and platelets.

TI  - Ellagic acid mitigates arsenic-trioxide-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and 
      cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.
LID - 10.1002/jbt.22024 [doi]
AB  - In the current study, neuroprotective significance of ellagic acid (EA, a 
      polyohenol) was explored by primarily studying its antioxidant and antiapoptotic 
      potential against arsenic trioxide (As(2) O(3) )-induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y 
      human neuroblastoma cell lines. The mitigatory effects of EA with particular 
      reference to cell viability and cytotoxicity, the generation of reactive oxygen 
      species, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dynamics were studied. Pretreatment of 
      SH-SY5Y cells with EA (10 and 20 muM) for 60 min followed by exposure to 2 muM 
      As(2) O(3) protected the SH-SY5Y cells against the harmful effects of the second. 
      Also, EA pre-treated groups expressed improved viability, repaired DNA, reduced 
      free radical generation, and maintained altered mitochondrial membrane potential 
      than those exposed to As(2) O(3) alone. EA supplementation also inhibited As(2) 
      O(3) -induced cytochrome c expression that is an important hallmark for 
      determining mitochondrial dynamics. Thus, the current investigations are more 
      convinced for EA as a promising candidate in modulating As(2) O(3) -induced 
      mitochondria-mediated neuronal toxicity under in vitro system.

TI  - Current status and future possibilities of molecular genetics techniques in 
      Brassica napus.
PG  - 479-492
LID - 10.1007/s10529-018-2510-y [doi]
AB  - As PCR methods have improved over the last 15 years, there has been an upsurge in 
      the number of new DNA marker tools, which has allowed the generation of 
      high-density molecular maps for all the key Brassica crop types. Biotechnology 
      and molecular plant breeding have emerged as a significant tool for molecular 
      understanding that led to a significant crop improvement in the Brassica napus 
      species. Brassica napus possess a very complicated polyploidy-based genomics. The 
      quantitative trait locus (QTL) is not sufficient to develop effective markers for 
      trait introgression. In the coming years, the molecular marker techniques will be 
      more effective to determine the whole genome impairing desired traits. Available 
      genetic markers using the single-nucleotide sequence (SNP) technique and 
      high-throughput sequencing are effective in determining the maps and genome 
      polymorphisms amongst candidate genes and allele interactions. High-throughput 
      sequencing and gene mapping techniques are involved in discovering new alleles 
      and gene pairs, serving as a bridge between the gene map and genome evaluation. 
      The decreasing cost for DNA sequencing will help in discovering full genome 
      sequences with less resources and time. This review describes (1) the current use 
      of integrated approaches, such as molecular marker technologies, to determine 
      genome arrangements and interspecific outcomes combined with cost-effective 
      genomes to increase the efficiency in prognostic breeding efforts. (2) It also 
      focused on functional genomics, proteomics and field-based breeding practices to 
      achieve insight into the genetics underlying both simple and complex traits in 
      canola.

AB  - A new series of 1-phenyl-3-(4-(pyridin-3-yl)phenyl)urea derivatives were 
      synthesized and subjected to in vitro antiproliferative screening against 
      National Cancer Institute (NCI)-60 human cancer cell lines of nine different 
      cancer types. Fourteen compounds 5a-n were synthesized with three different 
      solvent exposure moieties (4-hydroxylmethylpiperidinyl and trimethoxyphenyloxy 
      and 4-hydroxyethylpiperazine) attached to the core structure. Substituents with 
      different pi and sigma values were added on the terminal phenyl group. Compounds 5a-e 
      with a 4-hydroxymethylpiperidine moiety showed broad-spectrum antiproliferative 
      activity with higher mean percentage inhibition values over the 60-cell line 
      panel at 10 microM concentration. Compound 5a elicited lethal rather than inhibition 
      effects on SK-MEL-5 melanoma cell line, 786-0, A498, RXF 393 renal cancer cell 
      lines, and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. Two compounds, 5a and 5d showed 
      promising mean growth inhibitions and thus were further tested at five-dose mode 
      to determine median inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values. The data revealed 
      that urea compounds 5a and 5d are the most active derivatives, with significant 
      efficacies and superior potencies than paclitaxel in 21 different cancer cell 
      lines belonging particularly to renal cancer and melanoma cell lines. Moreover, 
      5a and 5d had superior potencies than gefitinib in 38 and 34 cancer cell lines, 
      respectively, particularly colon cancer, breast cancer and melanoma cell lines.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of plant-bacterial 
      synergism in floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) for efficient remediation of an 
      oil field wastewater. Two plants, Brachiara mutica and Phragmites australis, were 
      vegetated on floatable mats to develop FTWs, and inoculated with bacterial cons 
      which were then inoculated with a consortium of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria 
      (Bacillus subtilis strain LORI66, Klebsiella sp. strain LCRI87, Acinetobacter 
      Junii strain TYRH47, Acinetobacter sp. strain LCRH81). Both plants successfully 
      removed organic and inorganic pollutants from wastewater, but bioaugmentation of 
      P. australis significantly enhanced the plant's efficiency to reduce oil content 
      (97%), COD (93%), and BOD (97%), in wastewater. Analysis of alkane-degrading gene 
      (alkB) abundance and its expression profile further validated a higher microbial 
      growth and degradation activity in water around P. australis as well as its roots 
      and shoots. This study provides insight into the available phytotechnology for 
      remediation of crude oil-contaminated water and introduces a wetland macrophyte, 
      P. australis, with tailor-made bacterial consortium as an effective tool for 
      improved phytoremediation efficiency of FTWs.

TI  - Emphysema.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Pulmonary emphysema, a progressive lung disease, is a form of chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD). The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung 
      Disease (GOLD) has defined COPD as "a common, preventable, and treatable disease 
      that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation 
      that is due to airway or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant 
      exposure to noxious particles or gases."  COPD is the third leading cause of 
      death worldwide. COPD encompasses patients with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. 
      Although these conditions are identified as separate entities, most patients with 
      COPD have features of both. COPD often coexists with comorbidities that can 
      impact the progression and management of the disease. Emphysema, specifically, is 
      a pathological diagnosis that affects the air spaces distal to the terminal 
      bronchiole. It is characterized by abnormal and permanent enlargement of lung air 
      spaces, the destruction of the air space walls without fibrosis, and a loss of 
      elasticity in the lung parenchyma.

TI  - Vancomycin Infusion Reaction.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Vancomycin infusion reaction, formerly known as red man syndrome, is one of two 
      types of hypersensitivity reactions that can occur with 
      vancomycin administration- the other being anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is an 
      allergic immunoglobulin E (IgE) immune-mediated reaction, whereas vancomycin 
      infusion reaction is an anaphylactoid hypersensitivity response triggered by 
      the rapid infusion of vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic.  Vancomycin infusion 
      reaction occurs due to the release of histamine from the degranulation of mast 
      cells and basophils, a nonimmune-mediated process. The amount of histamine 
      released is typically related to the dose of vancomycin and the infusion rate. 
      Although vancomycin infusion reaction is typically associated with rapid infusion 
      rates (for example, <1 h), it has been reported with slower rates, even several 
      days after vancomycin administration. Vancomycin infusion reaction has rarely 
      been reported with topical application and oral administration, typically when 
      treating Clostridiodes difficile. The condition manifests as a 
      pruritic, erythematous rash on the face, neck, and upper torso, which may involve 
      the extremities to a lesser degree and angioedema. Symptoms of vancomycin 
      infusion reaction may include weakness, chest and back pain, hypotension, shock, 
      and even cardiac arrest. Differentiation must be made from vancomycin-induced 
      anaphylaxis, an IgE-mediated response that requires prior exposure to vancomycin. 
      Treatment typically involves stopping the infusion and re-administering 
      vancomycin at a slower rate.

AB  - Liquid effluent produced from tanning industries is loaded with organic and 
      inorganic contaminants, particularly heavy metals, which may cause severe damage 
      to the ecosystem. Constructed wetland (CW) is a promising product of the research 
      in the field of ecological engineering which helps to overcome aquatic pollution. 
      This investigation aims to develop a plant-endophyte synergism in CW for the 
      efficient remediation of tannery effluent. In a vertical flow CW, Brachiaria 
      mutica was vegetated and augmented with three endophytic bacterial strains. 
      Results showed a reduction of 82% in COD, 94% in BOD(5), and 95% in Cr by 
      plant-endophyte synergism in CWs and it was significantly higher than the use of 
      plants alone. Similarly, nutrients (N and P), lipids, ion content, SO(4)(2-), and 
      Cl(-) showed similar reduction by the combined action of endophytes and B. mutica 
      in CWs. The endophytes inoculation enhanced bacterial population in different 
      compartments of the plants vegetated in CWs and the maximum was observed in the 
      roots. This study revealed that plant-endophyte synergism in CWs can enhance the 
      remediation of industrial wastewater.

AB  - Due to the critical role of cellular enzymes necessary for cell proliferation by 
      deciphering topological hurdles in the process of DNA replication, topoisomerases 
      have been one of the major targets in the anticancer drug development area. A 
      need, therefore, arises for new metallodrugs that specifically recognizes DNA and 
      inhibits the activity of topoisomerase enzymes, herein, we report the synthesis 
      and characterization of new metal-based glycoconjugate entities containing 
      heterobimetallic core Cu(II)-Sn(IV) (1) and Ni(II)-Sn(IV) (2) derived from 
      N-glycoside ligand (L). The optimized structure of complex 1 and other 
      significant vibrational modes have been explained using dispersion corrected 
      B3LYP/DFT calculations. In vitro DNA binding profile of the L and both the 
      complexes 1 and 2 were done by various biophysical studies. Complex 1 breaks 
      pBR322 DNA via a hydrolytic means which was validated by T4 DNA enzymatic assay. 
      To get a mechanistic insight of mode of action topoisomerase I (Topo I) 
      inhibition assay was carried out. Also, we have taken the help of molecular 
      modeling studies in accordance with experimental findings. In vitro cytotoxicity 
      of the complex 1 was evaluated against a panel of cancer cells which exhibited 
      remarkably good anticancer activity (GI(50) values <10 mug/ml). Moreover, 
      intracellular localization of the complex 1 was visualized by confocal microscopy 
      against HeLa cells.

AB  - HCC has been reported to be immensely occurring carcinoma worldwide. Recent days 
      the mortality occurred due to liver cancer has also been found to be increased at 
      an alarming speed affecting mostly the young patients. The aim of the current 
      study was to decipher the role of calcium and vitamin K3 in the treatment of 
      chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis in the male Wistar rats. Liver cancer was 
      induced via a subnecrogenic dose of 160 mg/kg body weight, diethylnitrosamine 
      (DENA) when associated with fasting/refeeding in male Wistar rats. It elevated 
      the serum glutamate oxaloacetate (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase 
      (SGPT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, total cholesterol (CH), 
      triglycerides (TG), alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) and reduced high-density lipoprotein 
      (HDL). Histopathological examination of liver tissue showed marked 
      carcinogenicity of the chemical carcinogen. Food, water intake and animal weights 
      were also assessed, respectively. The animals exposed to DENA showed a 
      significant decrease in the body weight. The elevated levels of serum SGOT, SGPT, 
      ALP, AFP, TC and TG were restored by administration of calcium and Vit K (ad 
      libitum) combination at higher dose than the normal dietary requirement (3 mg/kg) 
      daily for 12 weeks p.o. Physiological and biochemical analysis showed the 
      beneficial effects of calcium and vitamin K3 combination in the animals exposed 
      to DENA. The results deciphered the beneficial effects of calcium and vitamin K3 
      in combination.

AB  - The current study was designed to evaluate bioactive compounds under the 
      influence of biotic stress on seedlings of Peganum harmala. Biologically active 
      compounds were determined by using different techniques. The HPLC and GC-MS 
      analyses detected the significant amount of phenolic acids and active biological 
      compound. Total protein content, activity of proteases, alpha-amylases, catalases and 
      peroxidases were observed to be accelerated under fungal stress. The seedling 
      extracts exhibited prominent antifungal and antimicrobial activity against 
      selected strains. The present study showed that P. harmala is a good candidate to 
      be used in natural therapies and medicine.

AB  - Arsenic is a pervasive environmental pollutant that is found in ground waters 
      globally and is related to numerous morbidities in the high-risk population areas 
      in countries including Bangladesh, India, and the USA. Arsenic exposure has been 
      ubiquitously reported for exacerbating free radical generation, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, and apoptosis by interfering with the mPTP functioning. Over the 
      past decades, nutraceuticals with antioxidant properties have shown promising 
      efficacy in arsenic poisoning. In the present study, we have examined, the 
      protective efficacy of thymoquinone (TQ), an active component of seed oil of 
      Nigella sativa with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity on arsenic-induced 
      toxicity in hippocampi of Wistar rats. In our results, arsenic conditioning 
      (10 mg/kg b.wt.; p.o.) for 8 days has caused a significant increase in 
      intracellular ROS generation, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptotic events. On 
      the contrary pretreatment with TQ (2.5 and 5 mg/kg b.wt.; p.o.) inhibited 
      arsenic-induced mitochondrial dysfunction such as lowering of mitochondrial 
      membrane potential (Deltapsim). Our results indicated that the neuroprotective efficacy 
      of TQ in arsenic-induced stress is mediated through or in part by inhibition of 
      mPTP opening. Demonstration of neuroprotective action of TQ provides insight into 
      the pathogenesis of arsenic-related neuropathological morbidities.

AB  - Phenol is a commonly found organic pollutant in industrial wastewaters. Its 
      ecotoxicological significance is well known and, therefore, the compound is often 
      required to be removed prior to discharge. In this study, plant-bacterial 
      synergism was established in floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) in an attempt to 
      maximize the removal of phenol from contaminated water. A common wetland plant, 
      Typha domingensis, was vegetated on a floating mat and augmented with three 
      phenol-degrading bacterial strains, Acinetobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus cereus 
      LORH97, and Pseudomonas sp. LCRH90, to develop FTWs for the remediation of water 
      contaminated with phenol. All of the strains are known to have phenol-reducing 
      properties, and grow well in FTWs. Results showed that T. domingensis was able to 
      remove a small amount of phenol from the contaminated water; however, bacterial 
      augmentation enhanced the removal potential significantly, i.e., 0.146 g/m(2)/day 
      vs. 0.166 g/m(2)/day, respectively. Plant biomass also increased in the presence 
      of bacterial consortia; and inoculated bacteria displayed successful 
      colonization/survival in the rhizosphere, root interior and shoot interior of the 
      plant. Similarly, highest reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical 
      oxygen demand (BOD(5)), and total organic carbon (TOC) was achieved by the 
      combined application of plants and bacteria. The study demonstrates that the 
      plant-bacterial synergism in a FTW may be a more effective approach for the 
      remediation of phenol-contaminated water.

      soil) in the vicinity of an oil exploration and production company. Endophytes 
      augmentation improved plant growth, crude oil degradation, and soil health. 
      Maximum oil degradation (80%) was achieved with B. mutica plants augmented with 
      the endophytes and it was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the use of plants 
      or bacteria individually. Moreover, endophytes showed more persistence, the 
      abundance and expression of alkB gene in the rhizosphere as well as in the 
      endosphere of the tested plants than in unvegetated soil. A positive relationship 
      (r = 0.70) observed between gene expression and crude oil reduction indicates 
      that catabolic gene expression is important for hydrocarbon mineralization. This 
      investigation showed that the use of endophytes with appropriate plant is an 
      effective strategy for the cleanup of oil-contaminated soil under field 
      conditions.

TI  - Antineoplastic influence of nimesulide in chemically induced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma by inhibition of DNA synthesis.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma is emerging as one of the most common forms of cancer 
      resulting in thousands of death worldwide. The purpose of this study was to 
      screen nimesulide for anticancer activity in chemically induced hepatocellular 
      carcinoma in Wistar rats as well as in BEL 7402 and HEP G2 cell lines. HCC in 
      rats was induced by administering a single dose of diethyl nitrosamine 
      (150 mg/kg) intraperitoneally. Duration of the in vivo study was 12 weeks and the 
      anticancer potential was further confirmed by in vitro cell line study. 
      Administration of DENA in Wistar rats significantly elevated the levels of serum 
      biochemical parameters and alpha-feto protein. Treatment with different dose of 
      nimesulide significantly decreased the markedly raised serum levels of 
      biochemical parameters as well as maintained the histology of the liver tissues 
      nearly similar to the normal. Further study of hepatocytes enzymes showed that 
      treatment with nimesulide also improved the antioxidant enzyme levels. Our study 
      also examined the cytotoxicity and DNA synthesis inhibition by nimesulide in BEL 
      7402 and Hep G2 cell lines. Cell viability was assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine 
      uptake procedure. The results obtained by in vitro cell line study, 
      histopathological and biochemical data concluded that nimesulide, a preferential 
      COX-2 inhibitor, has anticancer activity, which is by first reducing the 
      formation of reactive oxygen species and second by inhibiting the PGE(2) effect 
      via Wnt signaling pathway (cell invasion, angiogenesis, and cell proliferation).

TI  - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Compliance.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Protected health information (PHI) breaches have affected over 176 million 
      patients in the United States. Most of these breaches resulted from employees' 
      negligence and noncompliance with HIPAA regulations rather than external hacking. 
      The US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), also 
      known as the Kennedy-Kassebaum Act or Kassebaum-Kennedy Act, comprises 5 Titles, 
      as mentioned below. Title I: Protects health insurance coverage for workers and 
      their families during job changes or losses. This Title restricts new healthcare 
      plans from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions. Title II: Addresses 
      healthcare fraud and abuse, implements medical liability reform, and promotes 
      administrative simplification by establishing national standards for electronic 
      healthcare transactions and national identifiers for providers, employers, and 
      health insurance plans. Title III: Provides guidelines for pre-tax medical 
      spending accounts and introduces changes to health insurance laws and deductions 
      for medical insurance. Title IV: Offers guidelines for group healthcare plans, 
      including modifications to health coverage provisions. Title V: Regulates 
      company-owned life insurance policies, provides provisions for treating 
      individuals without US citizenship, and repeals financial institution rules 
      related to interest allocation. Questions to Consider Why was HIPAA established? 
      The statute aims to establish confidentiality systems within healthcare 
      facilities and beyond. The primary goal of HIPAA is to protect the privacy of 
      PHI. Whom does HIPAA cover? All individuals working in healthcare facilities or 
      private offices. Students. Non-patient care employees. Healthcare plans (eg, 
      insurance companies). Billing companies. Electronic medical record companies. 
      What are the primary goals of HIPAA? To limit the use of PHI to individuals with 
      a "need to know.". To impose penalties on those who fail to comply with 
      confidentiality regulations. What healthcare information is protected? Any 
      healthcare information that contains an identifier linking it to a specific 
      patient (eg, name, social security number, telephone number, email address, 
      street address, and other personal identifiers). What is the difference between 
      HIPAA privacy rules, use, and disclosure of information? Privacy rules: Require 
      patients to give signed consent for the use or disclosure of their personal 
      information. Use: Refers to how information is utilized within a healthcare 
      facility. Disclosure: Refers to how information is shared outside a healthcare 
      facility. What are the legal exceptions when healthcare professionals can breach 
      confidentiality without permission? Gunshot wounds. Stab wounds. Injuries 
      sustained during a criminal act. Abuse of children or older adults. Infectious, 
      communicable, or reportable diseases. What types of data are protected by HIPAA? 
      Written, paper, spoken, or electronic data. Transmission of data within and 
      outside a healthcare facility. Any individual or institution involved with 
      healthcare-related data. Data size is irrelevant. (Please see StatPearls' 
      companion resource, "Patient Confidentiality," for more information.) What types 
      of electronic devices must facility security systems protect? Both hardware and 
      software. Unauthorized access to healthcare data or devices, including user 
      attempts to change passwords at defined intervals. What are the 
      qualifications and responsibilities of a HIPAA security officer? An information 
      technology (IT) background. Document and maintain security policies and 
      procedures. Audit systems. Conduct risk assessments and ensure compliance with 
      policies and procedures. What does a security risk assessment entail? It should 
      be conducted at all healthcare facilities. It involves assessing the risks of 
      virus infections and hacking attempts. It includes developing safeguards to 
      mitigate identified risks. What are physical safeguards? They secure printers, 
      fax machines, and computers. They help install locks on computer rooms and record 
      storage areas. They destroy sensitive information when it is no longer needed. 
      What type of employee training for HIPAA is necessary? Training should ideally be 
      conducted under the supervision of the security officer. The level of training 
      and access should correspond to the employee's responsibilities. Annual HIPAA 
      training, including updates, is mandatory for all employees. What type of 
      reminder policies should be in place? Email alerts and posters. Log-on and 
      log-off computer notices. How should a sanctions policy for HIPAA violations be 
      written? The policy should be clear, unambiguous, and written in plain English. 
      It should apply equally to all employees and contractors. The sale of information 
      should result in termination. Repeated offenses should lead to progressively 
      harsher penalties. What discussions regarding patient information may be 
      conducted in public locations? None. All conversational information is protected 
      by confidentiality and HIPAA. Patient information or PHI should not be discussed 
      in public locations. How do you protect electronic information? Computer screens 
      should be pointed away from public view. Privacy sliding doors should be used at 
      the reception desk. PHI should never be left unattended. Workstations should be 
      logged off when leaving the area. How do you ensure password protection? By not 
      sharing passwords. By not writing down passwords. By not verbalizing passwords. 
      By not emailing passwords to others. How do you select a safe password? One 
      should avoid selecting consecutive digits. One should not choose information that 
      can be easily guessed. One should select something memorable but not easily 
      guessed.

TI  - A Multimodal Deep Log-Based User Experience (UX) Platform for UX Evaluation.
LID - 10.3390/s18051622 [doi]
LID - 1622
AB  - The user experience (UX) is an emerging field in user research and design, and 
      the development of UX evaluation methods presents a challenge for both 
      researchers and practitioners. Different UX evaluation methods have been 
      developed to extract accurate UX data. Among UX evaluation methods, the 
      mixed-method approach of triangulation has gained importance. It provides more 
      accurate and precise information about the user while interacting with the 
      product. However, this approach requires skilled UX researchers and developers to 
      integrate multiple devices, synchronize them, analyze the data, and ultimately 
      produce an informed decision. In this paper, a method and system for measuring 
      the overall UX over time using a triangulation method are proposed. The proposed 
      platform incorporates observational and physiological measurements in addition to 
      traditional ones. The platform reduces the subjective bias and validates the 
      user's perceptions, which are measured by different sensors through 
      objectification of the subjective nature of the user in the UX assessment. The 
      platform additionally offers plug-and-play support for different devices and 
      powerful analytics for obtaining insight on the UX in terms of multiple 
      participants.

TI  - Ellagic acid attenuates arsenic induced neuro-inflammation and mitochondrial 
      dysfunction associated apoptosis.
PG  - 411-417
LID - 10.1016/j.toxrep.2018.02.017 [doi]
AB  - Arsenic, being a global pollutant needs a potential remedy which could fight 
      against its associated toxicities. Ellagic acid (EA) is a known agent for its 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects, and it is commonly 
      found in fruits. The present study is designed to determine protective efficacy 
      of EA against arsenic induced toxicity with special mention to inflammation and 
      mitochondrial dysfunction in hippocampi of wistar rats. Rats were pre-treated 
      with EA (20 and 40 mg/kg b.wt; p.o. for 11 days) along with arsenic (10 mg/kg; 
      p.o. for 8 days). Total reactive oxygen species level and mitochondrial membrane 
      potential were analyzed using flow cytometry. Protein and mRNA expression of 
      apoptotic and inflammatory markers were also evaluated in rat hippocampus. Our 
      results show that arsenic exposure increased total ROS generation and DNA 
      fragmentation, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential alongwith an increase 
      in expression of pro-apoptotic and inflammatory markers. suggesting that EA 
      complementation downregulated total ROS generation dose dependently. Apoptotic 
      markers, BAX and Bcl(2) as well as inflammatory markers, IL-1beta, TNFalpha, INFgamma got 
      altered significantly on its administration. Moreover, it also attenuated effects 
      on mitochondrial membrane potential. Based on our findings, EA might substantiate 
      to be a budding therapeutic candidate against arsenic induced neurotoxicity.

TI  - Physiological Effects of Citrus Leafminer Phyllocnistis citrella (Lepidoptera: 
      Gracillariidae) Larval Feeding on Photosynthetic and Gaseous Exchange Rates in 
      Citrus.

AB  - Feeding damage by arthropods exposes plants to pathogens and interferes with 
      plant physiological processes. Feeding by the citrus leafminer (CLM), 
      Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: Gracillariidae), larva exposes leaf 
      cuticle to the causal pathogens of the citrus canker disease. We investigated the 
      impact of larval feeding on photosynthetic rate (Pn), CO2 exchange rate (Ci), and 
      H2O exchange rate (Wi) in eight citrus cultivars [Citrus mandarins (Kinnow, 
      Seedless Kinnow, Feutrell's early), Citrus sinensis (Succari, Salustiana), Citrus 
      tangerines (Fairchild), Citrus limon (China lemon), and Citrus paradisi Macfad 
      (Grapefruit)] under natural conditions in comparison with control plants 
      protected from larval feeding. The effects on gas exchange parameters were tested 
      by allowing the single first instar larvae per leaf to feed till pupation at the 
      rate of three leaves per plant and 10 plants per cultivar. A consistent reduction 
      in leaf Pn, Ci, and Wi rates with larval development through 19 d was observed in 
      all cultivars except Grapefruit in which all three parameters decreased through 
      13 d and then increased consistently through 19 d. Reductions in Pn, Ci, and Wi 
      were significantly correlated. All three parameters of CLM-infested plants were 
      reduced significantly compared to their levels in control plants except Pn in 
      Kinnow, China lemon, and Grapefruit; Ci in Grapefruit; and Wi in Succari. Pn was 
      reduced most in Fairchild, whereas Ci and Wi were reduced most in China lemon. 
      The consequences of these physiological alterations in regions with high CLM 
      populations could be even more intense and negatively impact plant health, 
      tolerance to pests and diseases, and yield.

TI  - Genome-wide expression profiling of leaves and roots of watermelon in response to 
      low nitrogen.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) is a key macronutrient required for plant growth and 
      development. In this study, watermelon plants were grown under hydroponic 
      conditions at 0.2 mM N, 4.5 mM N, and 9 mM N for 14 days. RESULTS: Dry weight and 
      photosynthetic assimilation at low N (0.2 mM) was reduced by 29 and 74% compared 
      with high N (9 mM). The photochemical activity (Fv/Fm) was also reduced from 0.78 
      at high N to 0.71 at low N. The N concentration in the leaf, stem, and root of 
      watermelon under low N conditions was reduced by 68, 104, and 108%, respectively 
      compared with 9 mM N treatment after 14 days of N treatment. In the leaf tissues 
      of watermelon grown under low N conditions, 9598 genes were differentially 
      expressed, out of which 4533 genes (47.22%) were up-regulated whereas, 5065 genes 
      (52.78%) were down-regulated compared with high N. Similarly in the root tissues, 
      3956 genes were differentially expressed, out of which 1605 genes were 
      up-regulated (40.57%) and 2351 genes were down-regulated (59.43%), compared with 
      high N. Our results suggest that leaf tissues are more sensitive to N deficiency 
      compared with root tissues. The gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that the 
      availability of N significantly affected 19 biological processes, 8 cell 
      component metabolic pathways, and 3 molecular functions in the leaves; and 13 
      biological processes, 12 molecular functions, and 5 cell component metabolic 
      pathways in the roots of watermelon. The low affinity nitrate transporters, high 
      affinity nitrate transporters, ammonium transporters, genes related with nitrogen 
      assimilation, and chlorophyll and photosynthesis were expressed differentially in 
      response to low N. Three nitrate transporters (Cla010066, Cla009721, Cla012765) 
      substantially responded to low nitrate supply in the root and leaf tissues. 
      Additionally, a large number of transcription factors (1365) were involved in 
      adaptation to low N availability. The major transcription factor families 
      identified in this study includes MYB, AP2-EREBP, bHLH, C2H2 and NAC. CONCLUSION: 
      Candidate genes identified in this study for nitrate uptake and transport can be 
      targeted and utilized for further studies in watermelon breeding and improvement 
      programs to improve N uptake and utilization efficiency.

TI  - Sheathless Focusing and Separation of Microparticles Using Tilted-Angle Traveling 
      Surface Acoustic Waves.
PG  - 8546-8552
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.8b01593 [doi]
AB  - Sheathless focusing and separation of microparticles is an important 
      preprocessing step in various biochemical assays in which enriched sample 
      isolation is critical. Most of the previous microfluidic particle separation 
      techniques have used sheath flows to achieve efficient sample focusing. The 
      sheath flow dilutes the analyte and requires additional microchannels and 
      accurate flow control. We demonstrated a tilted-angle traveling surface acoustic 
      wave (taTSAW)-based sheathless focusing and separation of particles in a 
      continuous flow. The proposed device consists of a piezoelectric substrate with a 
      pair of interdigitated transducers (IDTs) deposited at two different angles 
      relative to the flow direction. A Y-shaped polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
      microchannel having one inlet and two outlet ports was positioned on top of the 
      IDTs such that the acoustic energy coupling into the fluid was maximized and wave 
      attenuation by the PDMS walls was minimized. The two IDTs independently produced 
      high-frequency taTSAWs, which propagated at +/-30 degrees  with respect to the flow 
      direction and imparted a direct acoustic radiation force onto the target 
      particles. A sample mixture of 4.8 and 3.2 mum particles was focused and then 
      separated by the actuation of the IDTs at 194 and 136 MHz frequencies, 
      respectively, without using an additional sheath flow. The proposed taTSAW-based 
      particle separation device offered a high purity >99% at the both outlets over a 
      wide range of flow speeds (up to 83.3 mm/s).

TI  - Hypertensive Crisis.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - A hypertensive crisis refers to a severe acute elevation in blood pressure 
      (>180/120 mm Hg) with or without signs of hypertension-mediated organ damage. 
      This condition is classified as a hypertensive emergency when the elevated blood 
      pressure is accompanied by acute hypertension-mediated organ damage (formerly 
      known as end-organ damage). In contrast, in the absence of acute 
      hypertension-mediated organ damage, the condition is termed a hypertensive 
      urgency.  A hypertensive emergency is a potentially life-threatening condition 
      and requires early diagnosis and immediate management. Without treatment, the 
      prognosis is poor. Only 20% of individuals with untreated hypertensive 
      emergencies survive beyond 1 year, and the median survival time is reported to be 
      approximately 10.4 months. However, significant improvement in 1-year outcomes 
      has been observed in patients who receive timely and appropriate treatment 
      following early diagnosis. While the absolute blood pressure level is important, 
      the rate at which blood pressure rises may be even more critical. Patients with 
      chronic hypertension often tolerate higher blood pressure levels better than 
      those who were previously normotensive or had well-controlled hypertension. This 
      difference underscores the importance of prompt blood pressure reduction in 
      managing hypertensive emergencies to prevent or minimize further damage to target 
      organs. However, returning blood pressure to completely normal levels is not 
      always necessary.  Common manifestations of hypertension-mediated organ damage in 
      hypertensive emergencies include encephalopathy, intracerebral hemorrhage, acute 
      ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction, acute left ventricular failure with 
      pulmonary edema, unstable angina pectoris, dissecting aortic aneurysm, acute 
      renal failure, and eclampsia. Patients experiencing hypertension emergencies 
      require admission, and oral antihypertensive medications are not recommended 
      for initial management. Malignant hypertension is a severe and aggressive form 
      of hypertensive emergency, defined by an extreme elevation of blood pressure with 
      hypertension-associated microangiopathies affecting various organs, including the 
      retina, kidneys, and brain. The hallmark feature of malignant hypertension is 
      retinal involvement, presenting with changes such as flame-shaped hemorrhages and 
      papilledema, with and without microangiopathy and disseminated intravascular 
      coagulation. The hypertension-mediated organ damage in malignant hypertension is 
      not limited to the retina. Patients may also present with hypertensive 
      encephalopathy, pulmonary edema, and acute renal dysfunction. As the name 
      indicates, malignant hypertension is associated with rapid disease 
      progression and a poor prognosis, if not promptly and properly 
      treated. Hypertensive urgency is a form of hypertensive crisis characterized by a 
      severe elevation in blood pressure, typically a systolic blood pressure greater 
      than 180 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure exceeding 120 mm Hg, without 
      evidence of acute or imminent target organ damage. Unlike hypertensive 
      emergencies, hypertensive urgency does not involve life-threatening conditions 
      such as stroke, myocardial infarction, acute renal failure, or other forms of 
      end-organ damage that require immediate, aggressive intervention. Management 
      typically involves gradually reducing blood pressure, usually with oral 
      antihypertensive medications, over several hours to days in a controlled 
      outpatient setting. Patients are often asymptomatic or may present with 
      nonspecific symptoms that are not indicative of acute organ injury. The lifetime 
      prevalence of hypertensive crisis is estimated to be approximately 1% in the 
      general population, while individuals with hypertension face up to a 2% lifetime 
      risk of experiencing a hypertensive crisis. Notably, nearly one-fourth of 
      patients presenting to the emergency department with a hypertensive crisis have 
      no prior diagnosis of hypertension. Hypertensive crisis is generally more 
      prevalent in women, although some study results have reported a higher prevalence 
      in men. Individuals with hypertension who are nonadherent with treatment are at a 
      significantly higher risk of developing hypertensive crisis. Additionally, the 
      condition is reported to be more common in patients with secondary hypertension 
      compared to those with essential hypertension.

AB  - We report this case of a 21-year-old immunocompetent man presenting with 
      ulcerative colitis and superimposed Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) colitis. He 
      presented for the first time with symptoms of blood-mixed diarrhoea and raised 
      inflammatory markers. His endoscopic and histological appearances were found to 
      be due to ulcerative colitis for which he was started on standard therapy with 
      intravenous steroids. In spite of this, he continued to be symptomatic and his 
      inflammatory markers continued to rise. A virology screen done showed evidence of 
      previous EBV infection, and in view of poor response to immunosuppression, a 
      superimposed infection was suspected. EBV DNA PCR done on colonic biopsies was 
      found to be positive and the patient was started on intravenous ganciclovir to 
      which he responded well. This case highlights the importance of considering a 
      superimposed infection in patients with poor initial response to steroid therapy 
      in inflammatory bowel disease.

AB  - This analysis estimated secondary cancer risks after volumetric modulated arc 
      therapy (VMAT) and compared those risks to the risks associated with other 
      modalities of head-and-neck (H&N) radiotherapy. Images of H&N anthropomorphic 
      phantom were acquired with a computed tomography scanner and exported via digital 
      imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) standards to a treatment planning 
      system. Treatment plans were performed using a VMAT dual-arc technique, a 
      nine-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) technique, and a 
      four-field three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) technique. The 
      prescription dose was 66.0 Gy for all three techniques, but to accommodate the 
      range of dosimeter responses, we delivered a single dose of 6.60 Gy to the 
      isocenter. The lifetime risk for secondary cancers was estimated according to 
      National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) Report 116. VMAT 
      delivered the lowest maximum doses to esophagus (23 Gy), and normal brain (40 
      Gy). In comparison, maximum doses for 3DCRT were 74% and 40%, higher than those 
      for VMAT for the esophagus, and normal brain, respectively. The normal tissue 
      complication probability and equivalent uniform dose for the brain (2.1%, 0.9%, 
      0.8% and 3.8 Gy, 2.6 Gy, 2.3 Gy) and esophagus (4.2%, 0.7%, 0.4% and 3.7 Gy, 2.2 
      Gy, 1.8 Gy) were calculated for the 3DCRT, IMRT and VMAT respectively. Fractional 
      esophagus OAR volumes receiving more than 20 Gy were 3.6% for VMAT, 23.6% for 
      IMRT, and 100% for 3DCRT. The calculations for mean doses, NTCP, EUD and OAR 
      volumes suggest that the risk of secondary cancer induction after VMAT is lower 
      than after IMRT and 3DCRT.

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides (NAD(H)) play a vital role in various 
      biological processes, including keeping the cellular redox balance. In this 
      study, we investigate the regulatory responses of Streptococcus pneumoniae D39 to 
      NADH and characterize the role of the Rex protein as a transcriptional repressor 
      of the gapN, fba, pncB, adhB2, gap, and adhE genes. Transcriptomic analysis was 
      used to observe the response of S. pneumoniae D39 to NADH. Our microarray studies 
      revealed elevated expression of various genes/operons involved in transport and 
      biosynthesis of niacin (gapN, fba, pncB, adhB2, gap, and adhE). Promoter 
      lacZ-fusion assays and microarray studies with the rex mutant revealed the role 
      of Rex as a transcriptional repressor of gapN, fba, pncB, adhB2, gap, and adhE 
      involved in niacin uptake and biosynthesis, in the presence of NADH. We predict 
      the operator site (5'-TTGTKAWAAWWTTCACAA-3') of Rex in the regulatory regions of 
      Rex-regulated genes that was subsequently validated by promoter mutational 
      experiments.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is a widely existing metalloid in the biosphere. Drinking water 
      contamination by arsenic is a major route of human exposure, either by natural 
      means or through industrial pollution. Numerous evidence form earlier reports 
      suggest that arsenic exposure causes cerebral neurodegeneration which initiates 
      behavioral disturbances concomitant to psychiatric disorders. Also, mood 
      disorders in humans as well as in animals correlate with arsenic exposure; the 
      present study is carried out to implore the neuroprotective potential of 
      thymoquinone (TQ) in arsenic-stressed rats. TQ is an active component of Nigella 
      sativa (Kalonji) seed oil. Arsenic exposure in the form of sodium arsenate (10 
      mg/kg/day; p.o) caused neurobehavioral deficits as evidenced by changes in 
      locomotion and exploratory behavior in open-field and elevated plus maze tasks. 
      Alongside this, arsenate also elevated hippocampal oxidative stress parameters 
      like lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and protein carbonyl formation with a decrease in 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Genotoxicity 
      assessment by Comet assay also showed prominent levels of DNA damage. 
      Furthermore, arsenic also elevated hippocampal cytokine levels, TNF-alpha and INF-gamma. 
      However, TQ supplementation (2.5 and 5 mg/kg/day, p.o) preceded three days before 
      arsenic administration, significantly attenuated arsenic-associated anxiogenic 
      changes which majorly attributed to its antioxidant and anxiolytic potential. 
      Also, TQ pre-treated rats expressed positive shifts in the hippocampal oxidative 
      stress and cytokine levels with decreased DNA fragmentation. Thus, this study 
      concludes that TQ might serve as a strong therapeutic agent for management of 
      anxiety and depressive outcomes of arsenic intoxication.

TI  - 3D myocardial deformation analysis from cine MRI as a marker of amyloid protein 
      burden in cardiac amyloidosis: validation versus T1 mapping.
PG  - 1937-1946
LID - 10.1007/s10554-018-1410-5 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) is a significant contributor to heart failure with 
      preserved ejection fraction and is appreciating expanding therapeutic options. 
      Non-invasive tools aimed at accurate identification and surveillance of 
      therapeutic response are of immediate and expanding need. While native and 
      post-contrast T1 mapping quantify expansion of the extra-cellular compartment 
      from amyloid protein deposition, 3D strain analysis of non-contrast cine images 
      offers unique advantages relevant to high prevalence of renal insufficiency in 
      this population and reduced dependency on field strength, pulse sequence, and 
      vendor implementation. We aimed to evaluate global and segmental associations 
      between 3D strain and T1 mapping in patients with cardiac amyloidosis. Twenty 
      consecutive patients with confirmed CA were recruited and underwent a 
      standardized cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging protocol at 3 T including 
      using multi-planar cine imaging and T1 mapping using a shortened modified 
      look-locker inversion recovery sequence. T1 mapping was performed pre- and (when 
      permitted by renal function) post-contrast and measured for segmental T1 values. 
      Spatially-matched 3D strain-based measures were similarly calculated. Mean left 
      ventricular ejection fraction was 61 +/- 21% (range 30-73%). Mean global native T1 
      was 1308 +/- 96 ms. Post-contrast T1 and partition coefficient were 558 +/- 104 ms 
      and 0.85 +/- 0.31, respectively. Global myocardial strain values were 8.1 +/- 2.9% in 
      the longitudinal direction, - 9.2 +/- 3.4% in the circumferential direction, and 
      41.7 +/- 22.8% in the maximum principal direction. Segmental analyses confirmed 
      relative worsening in T1 values and reductions in strain values in the basal 
      myocardial segments with relative sparing of the apical segments. Significant 
      associations between T1 and strain-based measures were observed globally and 
      segmentally, with the strongest associations found both globally and segmentally 
      in the circumferential and minimum principal directions of deformation. This 
      study identifies strong associations between 3D myocardial strain and T1-mapping 
      based markers of regional amyloid protein deposition. These findings support 
      expanded investigation of myocardial strain as a surrogate marker of response to 
      novel therapeutic strategies in patients with cardiac amyloidosis.

AB  - A pilot-scale vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCWs) system was designed, 
      implemented and operated for one year for the treatment of dye-rich real textile 
      effluent. Brachiaria mutica was vegetated to develop VFCWs in which five 
      different textile effluent degrading endophytic bacteria were inoculated. These 
      bacteria were screened based on their dye degrading and plant growth promoting 
      capabilities. The system's performance was evaluated by monitoring 
      physicochemical parameters, nutrients removal, heavy metals reduction, 
      detoxification potential, and persistence of endophytic bacteria in the plant 
      rhizo- and endosphere. Although VFCWs were able to remove a majority of the 
      pollutants from the wastewater, bacterial augmentation further enhanced the 
      remediation efficiency. The system promoted an increase in dissolved oxygen up to 
      188% and, concomitantly, a substantial decrease in the chemical oxygen demand 
      (81%), biochemical oxygen demand (72%), total dissolved solids (32%), color 
      (74%), nitrogen (84%), phosphorous (79%), and heavy metals [Cr(97%), Fe(89%), 
      Ni(88%), Cd(72%)] was recorded. Wastewater treated with VFCWs augmented with 
      bacteria was found to be non-toxic and inoculated bacteria showed persistence in 
      the root and shoot interior of B. mutica. Conclusively, VFCWs proved to be an 
      effective methodology for treatment of textile effluent whereas its smaller size 
      with high efficiency is an advantage for field-scale applications.

TI  - Optimization of antibacterial activity of ethanolic extracts of Eucalyptus 
      tereticornis and Nigella sativa: Response surface Methodology.
PG  - 1259-1266
AB  - The screening of plants for medicinal purposes represents an effort to discover 
      newer, safer, and possibly more effective drugs. Design of the present study was 
      made aiming to the optimization of the antibacterial activity of ethanolic 
      extracts of Eucalyptus tereticornis (leaves) and Nigella sativa (seeds) against 
      bacteria belongings to both Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus 
      aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) spectrum by using response surface 
      methodology. 20 g powder of each E. tereticornis (leaf) and N. sativa (seeds) 
      were mixed with 200ml of ethanol at room temperature, and then it was centrifuged 
      at 4000 rpm for 10 min to separate the supernatants, and allowed to dry in order 
      to obtain ethanol free extracts. A fresh bacterial culture of 100mul of test 
      microorganism was inoculated onto media and spread homogeneously. The 
      antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extracts showed that all the concentrations 
      tested were effective against the test microorganisms. The diameters of zones of 
      inhibition exhibited by S. aureus PCSIR-83 were in the range of 0-28mm, E. coli 
      PCSIR-102 (0-28mm) and B. subtilis PCSIR-05 (15-26mm). The combination of N. 
      sativa (15mg/mul) and E. tereticornis (20mg/mul) were found most effective at pH 
      9.0 and temperature 35 degrees C. Our results clearly indicate that Gram positive 
      bacteria showed more sensitivity than Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Insecticides, essential for crop protection measures, leave behind several toxic 
      residues that can result in a series of human health disorders. Therefore, this 
      study was planned for the determination of residues and adverse effects of 
      insecticides in blood samples of sprayers, pesticide-industry workers and 
      controls by using blood parameters of these individuals as biomarkers. Optimized 
      analytical methods using GC-MS and HPLC for the simultaneous detection of 22 
      currently used insecticides were adopted. Eight of twenty-seven (22.22%) 
      sprayers' blood samples were found positive for five different insecticides. 
      Eleven of twenty-seven (40.74%) pesticide-industry workers were found positive 
      for eight different insecticides. The blood samples of both the exposed groups, 
      sprayers and industry workers had significantly (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-tests) 
      low hemoglobin-Hb concentrations (12.17 +/- 2.13 and 12.22 +/- 2.37 g/dl 
      respectively) than the average value of the control group with 14.23 +/- 2.37 g/dl. 
      The erythrocyte sedimentation rates (ESRs) in sprayers and insecticide industry 
      workers (28.78 +/- 20.72 and 28.17 +/- 25.14 mm/1st h respectively) were greater 
      significantly (P < 0.001; Mann-Whitney U test) than the control blood samples 
      (9.53 +/- 3.34 mm/1st h). These results indicate that the exposed individuals have 
      experienced significant hemotoxic effects during insecticide exposure. The study 
      also predicts the risk to exposed individuals in developing countries like 
      Pakistan and demands realization of safety measures to prevent such dangerous 
      effects of pesticide exposures.

      Phytoremediation advances in the field.

AB  - Constructed wetlands (CWs) have emerged as cost-effective and sustainable 
      treatment systems for the remediation of industrial wastewaters; nevertheless, 
      their potential has mostly been evaluated in laboratory-scale studies. Likewise, 
      endophytic bacteria can enhance plant growth and reduce phytotoxicity under 
      polluted conditions, but their application with pilot-scale CWs has rarely been 
      evaluated. The present study aims to evaluate on-site performance of 
      endophyte-assisted pilot-scale horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) for 
      the remediation of effluent from a textile industry. The HFCWs were established 
      by planting Leptochloa fusca in the presence of three endophytic bacterial 
      strains with dye degrading, and plant growth promoting capabilities. We found 
      that the system was able to remove a significant proportion of both organic and 
      inorganic pollutants. Maximum reduction of pollutants was observed in 
      endophyte-augmented HFCWs, where the COD and BOD reduced from 493 to 70 mg l(-1) 
      and 190 to 42 mg l(-1), respectively, within 48 h. Additionally, survival of 
      endophytic bacteria in different components of the HFCWs was also recorded. 
      Treated wastewater was found to be non-toxic and the inoculated bacteria showed 
      persistence in the wastewater as well as rhizo- and endosphere of L. fusca. 
      Accordingly, a positive impact on plant growth was observed in the presence of 
      bacterial augmentation. The system performance was comparable to the vertical 
      flow constructed wetlands (VFCWs) as high nutrients reduction was seen in the 
      presence of this partnership. This pilot-scale study is a step forward toward the 
      field-scale application of phytoremediation coupled with bacterial endophytes as 
      a cost-effective means of on-site wastewater remediation. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is among the first pilot-scale studies on use of HFCWs for 
      improvement in quality of textile industry effluent as most previous studies are 
      limited either in the context of engineering or lack effective interplay of plant 
      and bacteria.

AB  - The interface between biochar and soil differs from both the bulk soil and the 
      biochar itself, and has been termed the "charosphere". However, a complete 
      definition of the charosphere, including aspects of size, properties, functional 
      reach and effects on soil processes, is still required. In this study, the 
      distributions of functional genes related to the soil N cycle within the 
      charosphere were investigated over a multi-sectional gradient. We found that 
      concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), available phosphorus and 
      exchangeable cations (Ca(2+), Mg(2+), K(+)) increased with proximity to the 
      biochar surface (termed the 'near charosphere'). Similarly, the abundance of 
      bacterial amoA was greater in the near charosphere, while archaeal amoA abundance 
      was relatively homogenous. This taxonomic asymmetry resulted in a shift in the 
      predominant ammonia-oxidizers from ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) to 
      ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in the far charosphere. This was associated with 
      other factors such as decreasing pH and carbon availability with increasing 
      distance from the biochar. Moreover, the ratio of nosZ/(nirS + nirK) genes also 
      showed functionally asymmetry in the charosphere: increasing with increasing 
      distance from the biochar. This is the first study to map spatial distributions 
      of a set functional genes related to soil N cycling in the soil around biochar. 
      This exploration into the underlying heterogeneity of biochar-affected mechanisms 
      of N transformation provides new insight into the functional geometry of the 
      charosphere.

AB  - X-linked red-green color blindness is the most widespread form of vision 
      impairment. The study aimed to determine the prevalence and gene frequencies of 
      red-green color vision impairments among children of six different human 
      populations of Jammu province. A total of 1028 healthy subjects (6-15 years of 
      age) were selected from five Muslim populations and the color vision impairments 
      were determined using the Ishihara's test of color deficiency. The gene frequency 
      was calculated using Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium method. The prevalence of color 
      vision deficiency (CVD) ranged from 5.26% to 11.36% among males and 0.00%-3.03% 
      among females of six different populations. The gender based differences in the 
      frequency of CVD was found to be statistically significant (p < 0.0001), with a 
      higher prevalence among male (7.52%) as compared to female (0.83%) children. We 
      observed high frequency of deutan as compared to protan defects. The incidences 
      of deuteranomaly (5.68%) and deuteranopia (2.27%) were higher among male children 
      of Syed population while the frequencies of protanomaly (1.94%), protanopia 
      (1.28%) and achromacy (2.27%) were the highest among male subjects of Khan, Malik 
      and Syed populations, respectively. The allele and genotype frequencies showed 
      cogent differences among six populations. The population based assessment of CVDs 
      help patients to follow adaptive strategies that could minimize the risks of the 
      disease.

TI  - Improvised Laparostomy Pack to Manage Laparostomy for Injuries due to Improvised 
      Explosive Devices (IEDs).
PG  - 791-793
AB  - Splinters of improvised explosive devices [IEDs] cause multiple intestinal 
      perforations and random pattern visceral injuries causing contamination of 
      peritoneal cavity. This necessitates multiple peritoneal toilets and relook 
      surgeries. Surgical management is to perform laparostomy to avoid life 
      threatening complication, like abdominal compartment syndrome and fulminant 
      sepsis. "Peshawar pack" is a three-layer temporary abdominal dressing pack for 
      managing laparostomy. It is prepared in operation room and applied on patients 
      with ease. Patients with abdominal injuries due to blasts of IEDs, managed with 
      Peshawar pack during June 2014 to June 2016, were studied to determine the 
      effectiveness and practical utility of Peshawar pack. Data was analysed by SPSS 
      version 22. Total numbers, means +SD and frequencies with percentages were 
      described. In fifty-five patients selected for the study, effective drainage of 
      peritoneal cavity and control of peritoneal sepsis was achieved in all cases. 
      Mobilisation out of bed was possible in 38 cases [70%] within 3-5 days and 
      evisceration during mobilisation occurred in 02 cases [3.6%]. There was no case 
      of iatrogenic gut injury. Complete fascial closure in staged manner was achieved 
      in 53 cases [96%]. Peshawar pack is a simple, practical, and effective method for 
      laparostomy care in abdominal injuries due to blast of IEDs.

TI  - Bioremediation of tannery effluent by Cr- and salt-tolerant bacterial strains.
PG  - 716
LID - 10.1007/s10661-018-7098-0 [doi]
AB  - Microorganisms have great potential to control environmental pollution, 
      particularly industrial sources of water pollution. Currently, leather industry 
      is regarded as the most polluting and suffering from negative impacts due to the 
      pollution it adds to the environment. Chromium, one of the hazardous pollutants 
      discharged from tanneries, is highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature. Effective 
      treatment of tannery effluent is a dire need of the era as a part of 
      environmental management. Among all the wastewater treatment technologies, 
      bioremediation is the most effective and environment-friendly tool to manage the 
      water pollution. The present study evaluated the potential of 11 previously 
      isolated bacterial strains, tolerant to high concentrations of salts and Cr for 
      the bioremediation of tannery effluent. Among all the tested strains, 
      Enterobacter sp. HU38, Microbacterium arborescens HU33, and Pantoea stewartii 
      ASI11 were found most effective in reducing biological oxygen demand (BOD), 
      chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended 
      solids (TSS), and chromium (Cr) 70, 63, 57, 87, and 54%, respectively, of tannery 
      effluent and proliferated well under highly toxic conditions, at 9 days of 
      incubation. The pollutant removal efficacy of these bacterial strains can be 
      improved by extending the incubation period or by increasing the amount of 
      inoculum.

TI  - Furanoid F-Acid F6 Uniquely Induces NETosis Compared to C16 and C18 Fatty Acids 
      in Human Neutrophils.
LID - 10.3390/biom8040144 [doi]
LID - 144
AB  - Various biomolecules induce neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation or 
      NETosis. However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly 
      established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several 
      lipid molecules. We extracted the lipid molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish 
      (Arius bilineatus, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas 
      chromatography(-)mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the lipid fraction-3 from 
      the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid 
      F-acid (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic acid) and common 
      long-chain fatty acids such as palmitic acid (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic acid (PO; 
      C16:1), stearic acid (SA; C18:0), and oleic acid (OA; C18:1). Using pure 
      molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different 
      degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis 
      that is rapid and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by both NADPH 
      oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By 
      contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent 
      NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for 
      long-chain fatty acid-induced NETosis, whereas, in F-acid-induced NETosis, Akt is 
      additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds 
      requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These 
      findings are useful for understanding F-acid- and other fatty acid-induced 
      NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for 
      regulating diseases involving NET formation.

AB  - Plants and bacteria individually as well as in synergism with each other hold a 
      great potential to degrade a wide range of environmental pollutants. Floating 
      treatment wetlands (FTWs) is an efficient and low-cost technology that uses the 
      synergistic interaction between plant roots and microbes for in situ remediation 
      of wastewater. The present study aims to assess the feasibility of FTW-based 
      remediation of oil field-produced wastewater using an interaction between two 
      plant species, Typha domingensis and Leptochloa fusca, in partnership with a 
      consortium of crude oil-degrading bacterial species, Bacillus subtilis LORI66, 
      Klebsiella sp. LCRI87, Acinetobacter Junii TYRH47, and Acinetobacter sp. BRSI56. 
      All the treatments reduced contaminant levels, but T. domingensis, in combination 
      with bacterial inoculation, exhibited the highest reduction in hydrocarbon (95%), 
      COD (90%), and BOD content (93%) as compared to L. fusca. This combination 
      maximally promoted increases in fresh biomass (31%), dry biomass (52%), and 
      length (25%) of plants as well. This effect was further signified by the 
      persistence of bacteria (40%) and considerable abundance (27%) and expression 
      (28.5%) of the alkB gene in the rhizoplane of T. domingensis in comparison to 
      that of L. fusca. The study, therefore, suggests that T. domingensis, in 
      combination with bacterial consortium, has significant potential for treatment of 
      oil field-produced water and can be exploited on large scale in FTWs.

AB  - Biomonitoring of people exposed to hazardous materials provides opportunities for 
      early identification of several diseases, particularly in those individuals who 
      are constantly exposed to pesticides, such as pesticide operators and workers in 
      pesticide manufacturing industry. However, data on this hot topic are limited in 
      Pakistan. In this study, insecticide toxic effects and biochemical alterations 
      (i.e., damage in DNA and enzyme activity) were studied in blood samples of 
      occupationally exposed individuals from Punjab, Pakistan. Eight out of 
      twenty-seven blood samples (29.6%) of the pesticide operators were found positive 
      in five insecticides, with the maximum concentration found for 
      chlorpyrifos-methyl (0.039 mug/mL). Eleven out of twenty-seven blood samples 
      (40.7%) of the pesticide industry workers were found positive in eight 
      insecticides, with the maximum concentration found for endosulfan (0.051 mug/mL). 
      Comet tail length was 16.88 +/- 4.57 mum in pesticide industry workers and 
      16.33 +/- 3.78 mum in pesticide operators, which were significantly higher 
      (P < 0.01) than that recorded in the control group (4.84 +/- 2.21 mum). Values of 
      serum cholinesterase (SChE) concentration were slightly lower (P > 0.05) in 
      exposed individuals, whereas values of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration were 
      significantly higher (P < 0.01) in exposed individuals compared with control 
      group. Exposure duration and total insecticide concentration in blood samples 
      were positively associated with comet tail length, ALT activity, AST activity, 
      and ALP activity, but negatively with SChE. DNA damage was higher in smokers vs. 
      non-smokers. Also, a positive association was found between comet tail length and 
      number of cigarettes per day. Overall, occupational exposure to insecticides can 
      pose serious health risks to pesticide operators and workers in pesticide 
      manufacturing industry, highlighting the necessity of personal protection in 
      those groups for preventing exposure and resultant health disorders.

AB  - Ten plant species were grown in constructed wetlands (CWs) to remediate water 
      containing 2% (w/v) crude oil. The plant species with better growth and biomass 
      production were Typha latifolia and Cyperus laevigatus, and they were 
      significantly correlated (R(2) = 0.91) with hydrocarbon degradation. From T. 
      latifolia and C. laevigatus, 33 hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial strains were 
      isolated from the rhizosphere, and root and shoot interiors. More diversified 
      bacteria were found in the rhizosphere and endosphere of C. laevigatus than those 
      of T. latifolia. The predominant cultural hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were 
      shown to belong to the genera Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter and Bacillus. In 
      addition to genes involved in hydrocarbon degradation, most of the bacteria 
      displayed multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) activities. This study suggests 
      the importance of selecting suitable bacterial strains with hydrocarbon 
      degradation and PGP activities for improving the efficacy of CWs used in 
      remediating water contaminated with crude oil.

TI  - Rutin inhibits carfilzomib-induced oxidative stress and inflammation via the 
      NOS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway.
PG  - 817-827

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carfilzomib (CFZ), a proteasome inhibitor approved by the FDA to 
      treat multiple myeloma, may cause nephrotoxicity. HYPOTHESIS: Rutin is a 
      bioflavonoid with antioxidant properties. We aimed to examine whether rutin 
      protects the kidney from CFZ-induced nephrotoxicity. STUDY DESIGN: This study 
      aimed to demonstrate the effect of rutin on CFZ-induced renal injury via the 
      inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation. METHODS: Wistar albino rats were 
      divided into six groups (n = 6): Group 1 (normal control; NC) was administered 
      normal saline for 3 weeks; Group 2 (CFZ/toxic group) received CFZ [4 mg/kg, 
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection] twice weekly for 3 weeks; Group 3 (standard 
      treatment group) was administered CFZ (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and olmesartan (2 mg/kg, 
      p.o.) for 3 weeks; Group 4 was administered CFZ (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and rutin 
      (10 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 weeks; Group 5 was administered CFZ (4 mg/kg, i.p.) and 
      rutin (20 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 weeks; and Group 6 was administered CFZ (4 mg/kg, 
      i.p.) and rutin (40 mg/kg, p.o.) for 3 weeks. We carried out haematological and 
      biochemical analyses, determined oxidative stress, caspase-3 activity, and 
      protein levels, and performed a histopathological evaluation to confirm 
      CFZ-induced nephrotoxicity and its prevention by rutin administration. RESULTS: 
      Exposure to only CFZ significantly (p < 0.05) increased white blood cell (WBC) 
      count, Hb%, and HTC% concentration; however, these features were significantly 
      decreased (p < 0.05) when olmesartan and rutin were administered. CFZ 
      administration significantly decreased (p < 0.0001) the level of antioxidant 
      enzymes; whereas, administration of olmesartan and rutin significantly reversed 
      (p < 0.05) their levels toward the normal range. The levels of caspase-3 enzyme 
      significantly increased (p < 0.001) in the CFZ group and were reduced toward the 
      normal values by olmesartan and rutin administration. Furthermore, the results of 
      NOS-2, NF-kappaB, IkBa, and IL-17 protein estimation and the histopathological 
      evaluation strengthened our findings that rutin exhibits a protective effect 
      against CFZ-induced nephrotoxicity. CONCLUSION: These findings clearly 
      demonstrate that rutin ameliorates CFZ-induced oxidative stress and inflammation 
      in nephrotoxicity via the NOS-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

TI  - Enhanced degradation of hydrocarbons by gamma ray induced mutant strain of 
      Pseudomonas putida.
PG  - 391-399
LID - 10.1007/s10529-019-02644-y [doi]
AB  - Soil contamination due to petroleum hydrocarbons is a ubiquitous environmental 
      problem for which efficient remediation alternatives are required. Application of 
      hydrocarbons degrading bacteria with enhanced degradation potential is such an 
      alternative. The aim of present investigation was to induce mutagenicity in 
      Pseudomonas putida through gamma-ray irradiation for the enhanced degradation of 
      crude oil. A total of mutant 10 bacterial strains (300A-J) were screened for 
      their degradation abilities in vitro; among which the performance of 300-B was 
      outstanding. Subsequently, spiked soil (30 g/kg crude oil) was augmented with the 
      wild-type parent strain and mutant 300-B strain in individual experiments. 
      Bacterial inoculation in both experiments enhanced hydrocarbons degradation; 
      however, degradation was 46.3% higher when 300-B mutant strain was employed. This 
      improved oil degradation was found to have a strong positive correlation with the 
      gene abundance and expression of the mutant strain, suggesting its successful 
      survival and catabolic potential in situ. Concomitantly, a better nutrients 
      assimilation and water utilization was observed in the experiment containing 
      300-B mutant. Yet preliminary, these findings highlight the importance of gamma 
      ray irradiation towards improved degradation potential of previously isolated 
      hydrocarbons degrading bacteria.

      The solubility-based protein fractionation data indicated that the salt soluble 
      fraction (globulin) and water-soluble fraction (albumin) proteins were the 
      predominant fractions in cowpea seeds comprising 45-50.3% and 31.2-35.5% of total 
      soluble proteins, respectively. The electrophoretic pattern revealed the 
      molecular heterogeneity among total proteins as well as different protein 
      fractions. The molecular weights of protein bands obtained by SDS-PAGE varied 
      between 10 to 250, 15 to 110, 15 to 150, and 15 to 130 kDa for total proteins, 
      albumins, globulins, and glutelins, respectively. A large number of bands were 
      found common to the various landraces, indicative of their close relationship 
      with one another. However, a few bands distinctive to some specific landraces 
      were also detected, indicating varietal differences. A 34 SRAP primer pair 
      combination generated a total of 1003 amplicons (loci) showed 100% polymorphism 
      with an average of 0.93 polymorphism information content (PIC) value. Landraces 
      displayed an average 0.50 similarity coefficient which clustered the landraces 
      corresponding to their growth habit in main clusters and to their geographical 
      origin in subcultures. Molecular and biochemical analysis were correlated with a 
      medium level (Mantel test, r = 0.56, P < 0.02). These findings revealed that seed 
      proteins and DNA polymorphism provide valuable information regarding the 
      variability among landraces and this information could be utilized for breeding 
      purposes in the enhancement of protein quality and quantity in grain legumes.

TI  - Foot-care behaviour amongst diabetic patients attending a federal care hospital 
      in Pakistan.
PG  - 58-63
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess foot-care behaviour in diabetics attending a tertiary care 
      hospital, and to see if there are any influencing factors. METHODS: The 
      cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted from September to November 2017 
      at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Islamabad, Pakistan, and comprised 
      diabetes patients either admitted to the wards or attending the outpatient 
      clinics. Foot-care behaviour was assessed through the validated Nottingham 
      Assessment of Functional Foot-care scale. A score over 50 demonstrated adequate 
      foot-care behaviour. The score was correlated with several variables. SPSS 23 was 
      used for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 400 individuals, 238(59.5%) were females 
      and 162(40.5%) were males. The overall mean age was 52.7111.84 years. Of the 
      total, 228(57%) had never received any education on proper foot-care; 289(72.3%) 
      had a scale score of less than or equal to 50. Urban or rural residence, monthly 
      income, literacy level, family history of diabetes, and previous foot-care 
      education provided by the healthcare provider were significant factors associated 
      with good foot-care behaviour (p<0.05 each). CONCLUSIONS: A majority of the 
      patients demonstrated inadequate foot-care behaviour..

TI  - Evaluation of phyto-medicinal efficacy of thymoquinone against Arsenic induced 
      mitochondrial dysfunction and cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells.
PG  - 224-230
LID - S0944-7113(18)30481-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.phymed.2018.09.197 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is evaluated that a few million individuals worldwide are 
      experiencing Arsenic (As) harmfulness coming about because of anthropogenic 
      discharges. There is likewise proof to propose that As can affect the peripheral, 
      as well as, the central nervous system (CNS). On the contrary, thymoquinone (TQ), 
      a biologically active ingredient of Nigella sativa has exhibited numerous 
      neuro-pharmacological traits since ancient times. HYPOTHESIS/PURPOSE: In the 
      present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was explored by primarily 
      studying its antioxidant and anti-apoptotic potential against Arsenic trioxide 
      (As(2)O(3)) induced toxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell lines. STUDY 
      DESIGN: For experimentation, cells were seeded in 96 well tissue culture plates 
      and kept undisturbed for 24 h to attain proper adhesion. After 75-80% confluence, 
      cells were pretreated with 10 microM and 20 microM thymoquinone (TQ) for 1 h After adding 
      2 microM As, cells were set aside for incubation for 24 h without changing the 
      medium. METHODS: The mitigatory effects of TQ with particular reference to cell 
      viability and cytotoxicity, the generation of reactive oxygen species, DNA 
      damage, and mitochondrial dynamics were studied. RESULTS: Pretreatment of SH-SY5Y 
      cells with TQ (10 and 20 muM) for an hour and subsequent exposure to 2 muM 
      As(2)O(3) protected the SH-SY5Y cells against the neuro-damaging effects of the 
      latter. Also, the SH-SY5Y cells were better preserved with increased viability, 
      repaired DNA, less free radical generation and balanced transmembrane potential 
      than those exposed to As(2)O(3) alone. TQ pretreatment also inhibited 
      As(2)O(3)-induced exacerbation in protein levels of BAX and PARP-1 and restored 
      the loss of Bcl(2) levels. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that TQ 
      may prevent neurotoxicity and As(2)O(3)-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity. It 
      is, therefore, worth studying further for its potential to reduce the risks of 
      arsenic-related neurological implications.

TI  - Acute Anemia.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Anemia is characterized by a deficiency in the number of circulating red blood 
      cells (RBCs), the amount of hemoglobin, or the percentage of packed RBCs in the 
      blood, known as hematocrit. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines anemia as 
      a hemoglobin level below 13 g/dL in males and below 12 g/dL in nonpregnant 
      females.  Anemia is classified into 2 main types: : Acute anemia: A sudden and 
      rapid decrease in RBCs defines acute anemia, typically caused by hemolysis or 
      acute hemorrhage. Chronic anemia: This type of anemia is characterized by a 
      gradual decline in RBCs over time. Chronic anemia has various underlying causes, 
      including iron or other nutritional deficiencies, chronic diseases, drug-induced 
      factors, and other comorbid health issues. Please see StatPearls' companion 
      resource, "Chronic Anemia," for further information on this type of anemia. While 
      chronic anemia may initially be asymptomatic in mild cases, patients with acute 
      anemia frequently present with symptoms of hemorrhagic shock, including 
      tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, and altered mental status. The severity of 
      shock is classified into 4 stages based on blood loss percentage, with increasing 
      signs of hemodynamic instability as blood loss progresses. The evaluation of 
      acute anemia primarily involves assessing its severity and identifying the source 
      of bleeding; management focuses on stabilizing airway, breathing, and circulation 
      (ABCs), stopping ongoing bleeding, and restoring blood volume.

AB  - This paper studies the reducibility of almost-periodic Hamiltonian systems with 
      small perturbation near the equilibrium which is described by the following 
      Hamiltonian system: / = J[A + epsilonQ(t, epsilon)]x + epsilong(t, epsilon) + h(x, t, epsilon). It is proved 
      that, under some non-resonant conditions, non-degeneracy conditions, the suitable 
      hypothesis of analyticity and for the sufficiently small epsilon, the system can be 
      reduced to a constant coefficients system with an equilibrium by means of an 
      almost-periodic symplectic transformation.

AB  - Insect physiology is affected by the presence of toxins in the surrounding 
      environment of insects as well as their food sources. The objective of this study 
      was to determine the effect of heavy metal exposure to two low concentrations 
      (50 mug/g and 150 mug/g) of lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) through artificial diet to the 
      larvae on biological parameters of Asian armyworm (Spodoptera litura Fabricius) 
      (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Both Pb and Zn, even at low concentrations, had 
      relatively high toxic effects on S. litura larvae (P < 0.01). S. litura larval 
      weight and length suffered the maximum reduction when the larvae were fed on diet 
      mixed with the high Pb concentration (150 mug/g) tested compared to the other 
      treatments. At the same Pb concentration (150 mug/g), values of larva growth 
      index, pupa growth index, immature growth index, standardized growth index, and 
      fitness index were 4.66, 7.33, 7.82, 5.35, and 10.00 times lower, respectively, 
      than those of control. At the same Zn concentration (150 mug/g), values of larval 
      growth index, pupal growth index, immature growth index, standardized growth 
      index, and fitness index were 5.61, 3.00, 3.04, 3.23, and 9.24 times lower, 
      respectively, than those of control. The survival rate of S. litura larvae was 
      also lower (12.5%) when the larvae were fed on diet mixed with Pb at 150 mug/g 
      after 10 days of observation. Overall, the presence of those heavy metals in the 
      environment, even at low concentrations, would exert an adverse impact on larvae 
      development of this insect. From this point of view, findings could provide a 
      basis for long-term evaluation of heavy metal risk and its impact on populations 
      of important agricultural pests.

AB  - Environmental variations resulting in biotic and abiotic stresses demand adaptive 
      changes in the photosynthetic machinery. To cope with these challenges, plant 
      scientists are constantly striving to enhance photosynthetic activity. The 
      photorespiration pathway, which fixes O(2) and releases CO(2) in C(3) plants, 
      competes with photosynthesis. One method to increase yield would be to enhance 
      photosynthesis by engineering the photorespiratory pathway. To date, three 
      engineered photorespiratory pathways have been produced, of which two have been 
      proven experimentally in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. These approaches 
      might be helpful in enhancing crop resilience to future environmental challenges. 
      In partially photorespiratory suppressed plants, it is hypothesized that a gene 
      cluster may have formed between bacterial glycolate dehydrogenase (GDH), 
      glyoxylate carboligase (GCL), and tartronic semi aldehyde (TSR) genes with 
      Arabidopsis allantoin degradation genes like Arabidopsis allantoinase (AtALN) to 
      utilize S-allantoin as a source of nitrogen. Observations of the use of allantoin 
      as an exclusive source of nitrogen or energy by Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli 
      led us to propose a genetic switch control model between nitrogen assimilation 
      and energy producing pathways in partially photorespiratory suppressed plants.

TI  - Physiological and biochemical responses of two spring wheat genotypes to 
      non-hydraulic root-to-shoot signalling of partial and full root-zone drought

AB  - Non-hydraulic root-sourced signal (nHRS) is so far affirmed to be a unique 
      positive early-warning response to drying soil, however its physiological and 
      agronomic implications are still unclear. We designed two contrast methods to 
      induce nHRS in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes released in different 
      decades under pot-culture conditions. Partial root-zone stress (PS) was performed 
      using the method of split-root alternative water supply (one half wetting and the 
      other drying) to induce the continuous operation of nHRS, and full root-zone 
      stress (FS) was subjected to whole root system to periodic operation of nHRS. 
      nHRS-mediated signalling increased abscisic acid (ABA) production and triggered 
      ROS (reactive oxygen species) generation, which, thereby, led to up-regulation of 
      antioxidant defense system. Cytokinin synthesis reduced during drought stress 
      while proline and malodialdehyde (MDA) content were increased. Regardless of 
      drought treatment methods and wheat genotype, a significant decrease in grain 
      yield, root biomass and above-ground biomass (p < 0.05) was observed, without 
      significant changes in root-to-shoot ratio. Harvest index was increased, 
      proposing that more energy was allocated to reproductive organs during the action 
      of nHRS. Moreover, higher water use efficiency was witnessed in PS. The data 
      suggest that nHRS triggered ABA accumulation, thereby closing stomata, and 
      reducing water use and also decreases the production of ROS and improves the 
      antioxidant defence enzymes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. This survey of 
      different-decade genotypes suggests that advances in grain yield and drought 
      tolerance would be made by targeted selection for a wheat genetic resource.

AB  - Heterobimetallic complexes [Cu(L)Sn(CH(3))(2)(H(2)O)(Cl)] (3) and 
      [Zn(L)Sn(CH(3))(2)(H(2)O)(Cl)] (4) have been synthesized from their monometallic 
      analogs [Cu(L)(H(2)O)(Cl)] (1) and [Zn(L)(H(2)O)(Cl)] (2) of Schiff base ligand 
      (L) which were characterized by various spectroscopic and analytical methods. DFT 
      calculations were carried out to simulate the vibrational spectra to support the 
      anticipated structures. The interaction studies of ligand (L) and complexes (1-4) 
      with CT-DNA were performed by employing UV-vis, and fluorescence spectroscopic 
      techniques which revealed that heterobimetallic complexes 3 and 4 showed higher 
      affinity with DNA due to dual mode of action as compared to monometallic 
      complexes 1 and 2. Further, validation of the interaction studies was 
      accomplished by carrying out molecular docking studies with DNA. Gel assay 
      displayed that both the complexes have ability to cleave DNA efficiently and are 
      specific minor groove binders. Cu(II)-Sn(IV) complex 3 cleaved pBR322 DNA via 
      oxidative mechanism, while Zn(II)-Sn(IV) complex 4 followed hydrolytic cleavage 
      pathway. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of complex 3 was tested on a different 
      cancer cell lines showing promising antitumor activity.Communicated by Ramaswamy

TI  - Effects of chelating agents on heavy metals in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) patients.
PG  - 1138-1149
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2019054 [doi]
AB  - Heavy metals are released into the environment through both human and natural 
      sources, may have a direct hepatic toxicity and are involved in chronic liver 
      diseases. Modification in the regulation of heavy metals metabolism enhanced 
      hepatitis c virus (HCV) replication which ultimately reduced outcomes of 
      anti-viral therapy in chronic HCV patients. Chelation therapy with new drugs 
      seems to eradicate HCV and may prevent liver complications. The present study was 
      planned to explore the effects of MiADMSA (lipophilic chelating agent) for 
      achieving maximum heavy metals elimination in hepatitis c virus patients with 
      minimum side effects. For this purpose concentration of heavy metal was 
      determined in HCV patients and established correlation of heavy metals between 
      healthy persons and HCV patients. Atomic absorption spectrophotometer (AAS) was 
      used to explore them. Concentrations of heavy metal in different samples (blood 
      serum, nails and hair) of patients and healthy individuals. Result revealed that 
      heavy metals (Lead, Cobalt, Cadmium, Manganese, Iron and Cooper) concentration 
      were significantly higher in blood of HCV patients as compared to normal persons, 
      but some metals like Ni and Zn were present in normal concentration and in low 
      concentration respectively. After chelation with monoisoamyl DMSA (MiADMSA) a 
      significant amount of heavy metals was excreted in the urine in a dose dependent 
      manner. It was generally observed from the results that TDS is a better treatment 
      option than BD for chelation of heavy metals in hepatitis c virus patients. This 
      chelation therapy will be helpful to reverse the HCV related health problems.

TI  - Inhibition of Hyperuricemia and Gouty Arthritis in BALB/c Mice Using Copper Oxide 
      Nanoparticles.
PG  - 494-501
LID - 10.1007/s12011-019-01734-2 [doi]
AB  - Nanoparticles are known for their unique properties and are being utilized in 
      various disciplines of sciences. Their nanosize enables them to higher exposure 
      and higher availability when given orally. Gout is an inflammatory disease caused 
      by deposition of monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition into the joints. The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles 
      on hyperuricemia and gouty arthritis in mice. In this research, synthesized 
      copper oxide nanoparticles of size ranging from 30 to 50 nm were administered 
      orally to mice having gouty arthritis and hyperuricemia. Various biochemical 
      markers were conducted to determine the effects of copper oxide nanoparticles. It 
      was observed that the mice treated with CuO NPs at various concentrations showed 
      a significant (0.001) decrease in the serum uric acid levels in comparison with 
      the negative control. Furthermore, creatinine levels were also normal in 
      comparison with the control mice. Measurement of synovial joints also revealed 
      that mice administered with CuO NPs had reduced inflammation of synovial joints 
      in comparison with the negative control. From this research, it was concluded 
      that copper oxide nanoparticles have potential in the treatment of hyperuricemia 
      and gouty arthritis by decreasing serum uric acid and inflammation in synovial 
      joints.

TI  - Use of mind maps and iterative decision trees to develop a guideline-based 
      clinical decision support system for routine surgical practice: case study in 
      thyroid nodules.
PG  - 524-536
LID - 10.1093/jamia/ocz001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study sought to develop a clinical decision support system (CDSS) 
      for the treatment of thyroid nodules, using a mind map and iterative decision 
      tree (IDT) approach to the integration of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thyroid nodule CPGs of the American Thyroid Association 
      and Korean Thyroid Association were analyzed by endocrine surgeons (domain 
      experts) and computer scientists. Clinical knowledge from the CPGs was expressed 
      using mind maps. The mind maps were analyzed and converted into IDTs. The final 
      IDT was implemented as a set of candidate rules (3700) for a knowledge-based 
      CDSS. The system was evaluated via a retrospective review of the medical records 
      of 483 patients who had undergone thyroidectomy between January and December 2015 
      at a single tertiary center (Seoul National University Hospital Bundang, Korea). 
      RESULTS: Concordance between CDSS recommendations and treatment in routine 
      clinical practice was 78.9%. In the 21.1% discordant cases, deviation from the 
      CDSS treatment recommendation was mainly attributable to (1) refusal of the 
      patient to undergo total thyroidectomy and (2) conversion from lobectomy to total 
      thyroidectomy following an unexpected histological finding during intraoperative 
      frozen biopsy lymph node analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated 
      that a knowledge-based CDSS is feasible in the treatment of thyroid nodules. A 
      high-quality knowledge-based CDSS was developed, and medical domain and computer 
      scientists collaborated effectively in an integrated development environment. The 
      mind map and IDT approach represents a pioneering method of integrating knowledge 
      from CPGs.

TI  - Removal of pharmaceuticals and personal care products using constructed wetlands: 
      effective plant-bacteria synergism may enhance degradation efficiency.
PG  - 21109-21126
LID - 10.1007/s11356-019-05320-w [doi]
AB  - Post-industrial era has witnessed significant advancements at unprecedented rates 
      in the field of medicine and cosmetics, which has led to affluent use of 
      pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). However, this has exacerbated 
      the influx of various pollutants in the environment affecting living organisms 
      through multiple routes. Thousands of PPCPs of various classes-prescription and 
      non-prescription drugs-are discharged directly into the environment. In this 
      review, we have surveyed literature investigating plant-based remediation 
      practices to remove PPCPs from the environment. Our specific aim is to highlight 
      the importance of plant-bacteria interplay for sustainable remediation of PPCPs. 
      The green technologies not only are successfully curbing organic pollutants but 
      also have displayed certain limitations. For example, the presence of 
      biologically active compounds within plant rhizosphere may affect plant growth 
      and hence compromise the phytoremediation potential of constructed wetlands. To 
      overcome these hindrances, combined use of plants and beneficial bacteria has 
      been employed. The microbes (both rhizo- and endophytes) in this type of system 
      not only degrade PPCPs directly but also accelerate plant growth by producing 
      growth-promoting enzymes and hence remediation potential of constructed wetlands.

AB  - Nitrification and denitrification are two important processes in the nitrogen (N) 
      cycle. Under heavy-metal pollution with water management of paddy soils, these 
      two processes are not well understood. This study aimed to examine the effect of 
      cadmium (Cd) on N transformation under flooding and non-flooding conditions. A 
      paddy soil was incubated under two water regimes (flooding and non-flooding) and 
      four Cd levels (0, 2, 5 and 10 mg kg(-1)). The availability of Cd was higher in 
      the non-flooding than flooding conditions. Cadmium contamination significantly 
      (p </= 0.05) decreased the copy number of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes, 
      bacterial nirS, nirK and nosZ genes under both conditions with the decrease being 
      greater under non-flooding. High level of Cd (10 mg kg(-1)) was more toxic in 
      non-flooding than flooding conditions to the nitrifiers and denitrifiers, which 
      in turn decreased N transformation through microbially-mediated processes. Its 
      contamination decreased N(2)O emission initially under both water regimes but the 
      effect was greater under the non-flooding condition. However, the non-significant 
      stimulatory effect of Cd on N(2)O emission was observed during the late phase. 
      The microbial community structure was changed with time and water regimes. 
      Irrespective of water regime, the dominated fungal phyla were Ascomycota and 
      Basidiomycota while the dominated bacteria phyla were Actinobacteria, 
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes and Acidobacteria. In summary, water regimes and Cd 
      bioavailability changed soil N transformations via microbial mediated processes.

AB  - Fabric bleaching is one of the most widely used processes of the textile industry 
      that also produces a significant amount of highly polluted wastewater. 
      Previously, expensive and chemically extensive conventional remediation systems 
      were used to treat bleaching effluent. Despite this, the potential of constructed 
      wetlands (CWs) as a treatment system remains un-investigated. Furthermore, most 
      research on the use of CWs for textile effluents are conducted at laboratory 
      scale and therefore further research at field-scale is timely. This study 
      compares the efficacy of bacterial augmented vertical flow constructed wetlands 
      (VFCWs) and horizontal flow constructed wetlands (HFCWs) for the remediation of 
      textile bleaching wastewater at pilot scale. To this end, CWs macrocosms of 
      1000 L water capacity were planted with Phragmites australis and inoculated with 
      bacterial strains possessing pollutant degradation and plant growth-promoting 
      traits. The results showed that both variants of CWs were effective in 
      attenuating pollutants from the wastewater; however, the performance of HFCWs 
      exceeded that of the VFCWs for almost every pollutant measure undertaken. For 
      HFCWs, a significant reduction in COD (89%), BOD (91%), TOC (96%), and toxicity 
      was achieved in a period of 72 h during the first month of operation. Bacterial 
      inoculation in CWs further improved the system's performance and these bacteria 
      also exhibited persistence in the rhizoplane (43%), root interior (56%) and shoot 
      interior (29%) of P. australis. This study, therefore, suggests that the 
      bacterial augmented HFCWs is a suitable approach for industrial scale textile 
      bleach wastewater treatment.

AB  - Last decade of molecular research in the field of cognitive science has shown 
      that no single approach can give satisfactory results as far as gene hunt is 
      concerned. Cohesive theory of gene-environment interaction seems to be a rational 
      idea for bridging the gap in our knowledge of disorders involving cognitive 
      deficit. It may even be helpful to some extent in resolving issues of missing 
      heritability. We review the current state of play in the area of cognition at 
      genetic and environmental fronts. Evidence of apparent gene-environment (GxE) 
      interactions from various studies has been mentioned with the aim of redirecting 
      the focus of research community towards studying such interactions with the help 
      of sensitive designs and molecular techniques. We re-evaluate candidate 
      gene-environment research in order to emphasize its potential if carried out 
      strategically.

AB  - Piperine (1-piperoylpeperdine), a nitrogenous pungent substance, is present in 
      the fruits of black pepper (Piper nigrum Linn.) and long pepper (Piper longum 
      Linn.). It possesses several pharmacological properties and has been extensively 
      explored for its anti-cancerous activities. The mechanism underlying its 
      anti-cancer potential in human cervical adenocarcinoma (HeLa) cells is not well 
      interpreted. The anti-proliferative effect and the mode of action of piperine 
      were investigated through some potent markers of apoptosis viz.reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) generation, cellular apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane 
      potential (MMP). DNA fragmentation, cell cycle kinetics, caspase-3 activity and 
      cell migration assays were also conducted to observe the efficacy of piperine 
      against HeLa cells. The results showed that piperine exposure induces apoptosis 
      significantly in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits the growth of HeLa cells 
      with an increase in ROS generation, nuclear condensation and delayed wound 
      healing. In addition, piperine also encourages cell death by the loss of MMP, DNA 
      fragmentation and the activation of caspase-3. Growth inhibition of HeLa cells 
      was found to be associated with G2/M phase arrest and sub-G1 accumulation. The 
      present study provides useful insight into the apoptotic potential of piperine 
      and further in vivo and clinical studies will be needed for its validation and in 
      the finding of more effective and least toxic regimens against cervical cancer.

TI  - Floating treatment wetlands as biological buoyant filters for wastewater 
      reclamation.
PG  - 1273-1289
LID - 10.1080/15226514.2019.1633253 [doi]
AB  - Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) are an innovative product of ecological 
      engineering that can play a promising role in wastewater treatment. It provides 
      low-cost, eco-friendly, and sustainable solutions for the treatment of 
      wastewater, particularly in regions with economic constraints. Generally, FTWs 
      comprise rooted plants that grow on the surface of water with their roots 
      extending down into the pelagic zone rather than being embedded into the 
      sediments. This drooping structure helps develop (1) a hydraulic flow between the 
      root network and the bottom of the treatment system and (2) a large biologically 
      active surface area for the physical entrapment (filtration) of contaminants, as 
      well as their biochemical transformation and degradation. Furthermore, the rooted 
      network allows proliferation of microorganisms that form biofilms and enhance 
      pollutant degradation while promoting plant growth. The augmentation of bacteria 
      in FTWs has been proven to be the most effective approach for reclamation of 
      wastewater. This article discusses the operational parameters of FTWs for maximal 
      remediation of wastewater and highlights the importance of plant-bacteria 
      partnerships in a typical FTW system for enhanced cleanup of wastewater. We 
      propose that this technology is preferable over other methods that require high 
      energy, costs, and area to install or operate machinery.

AB  - Citrus leafminer (CLM), Phyllocnistis citrella Stainton (Lepidoptera: 
      Gracillariidae), is one of the most important insect pests of Pakistan's citrus 
      nursery stock and caused extensive damage to young flushes. The organic compost 
      is a widespread technique used to manage insect pests and plant diseases. 
      Different composts (biofert, tara root and vermicompost) at 0.5 and 0.25 kg/plant 
      concentration in comparison to NPK fertilizer at 0.4 and 0.2 g/plant were 
      evaluated for CLM infestation and the associated citrus canker disease in nursery 
      plantations of Citrus reticulata Blanco. Application of biofert at 0.5 kg/plant 
      reduced the CLM infestation up to 54.5% during Fall-2016 and 39.1% during 
      Summer-2017 in comparison to control treatment. The CLM larval density was also 
      found lower by the application of biofert followed by vermicompost during both 
      seasons. Both concentrations of biofert followed by vermicompost at 0.5 kg/plant 
      resulted in remarkable protection against citrus canker disease in both flushes. 
      The incidence of canker associated with CLM infested leaves was also studied and 
      found lower by the application of biofert and vermicompost compared with control 
      treatment. Conclusively, the soil amendment using biofert and vermicompost 
      affects the CLM population and canker infection in nursery plantations. These 
      organic fertilizers can be used in future citrus IPM programs as a tool to 
      suppress the CLM population and citrus canker disease.

TI  - Furanoic Lipid F-6, A Novel Anti-Cancer Compound that Kills Cancer Cells by 
      Suppressing Proliferation and Inducing Apoptosis.
LID - 10.3390/cancers11070960 [doi]
LID - 960
AB  - Identifying novel anti-cancer drugs is important for devising better cancer 
      treatment options. In a series of studies designed to identify novel therapeutic 
      compounds, we recently showed that a C-20 fatty acid 
      (12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic acid, a furanoic acid or F-6) 
      present in the lipid fraction of the secretions of the Arabian Gulf catfish skin 
      (Arius bilineatus Val.; AGCS) robustly induces neutrophil extracellular trap 
      formation. Here, we demonstrate that a lipid mix (Ft-3) extracted from AGCS and 
      F-6, a component of Ft-3, dose dependently kill two cancer cell lines (leukemic 
      K-562 and breast MDA MB-231). Pure F-6 is approximately 3.5 to 16 times more 
      effective than Ft-3 in killing these cancer cells, respectively. Multiplex assays 
      and network analyses show that F-6 promotes the activation of MAPKs such as Erk, 
      JNK, and p38, and specifically suppresses JNK-mediated c-Jun activation necessary 
      for AP-1-mediated cell survival pathways. In both cell lines, F-6 suppresses 
      PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway specific proteins, indicating that cell proliferation and 
      Akt-mediated protection of mitochondrial stability are compromised by this 
      treatment. Western blot analyses of cleaved caspase 3 (cCasp3) and poly ADP 
      ribose polymerase (PARP) confirmed that F-6 dose-dependently induced apoptosis in 
      both of these cell lines. In 14-day cell recovery experiments, cells treated with 
      increasing doses of F-6 and Ft-3 fail to recover after subsequent drug washout. 
      In summary, this study demonstrates that C-20 furanoic acid F-6, suppresses 
      cancer cell proliferation and promotes apoptotic cell death in leukemic and 
      breast cancer cells, and prevents cell recovery. Therefore, F-6 is a potential 
      anti-cancer drug candidate.

AB  - World is facing the largest refugee crisis of its time due to continuously 
      outgoing wars, conflicts and natural disasters. One of the important aspects of 
      refugees and migrants is health. Till date, no comprehensive data was available 
      related to health status of Afghan refugees and internally displaced persons 
      (IDPs) in Pakistan. Here, we present health status for Afghan refugees for last 
      seven years and for IDPs for 2-4 years. For Afghan refugees the data was provided 
      by Commissionerate Afghan Refugee (CAR), Pakistan, whereas data for IDPs was 
      collected from hospitals and Basic health units (BHUs) of different districts of 
      Khyber Pakhtunkhwa namely Peshawar, Dera Ismail Khan and Bannu. Highest number of 
      Afghan refugee's deaths occurred due to cardiovascular problems. Most prevalent 
      reported infections were respiratory tract infections (48.05%). Skin diseases and 
      Diarrhea collectively affected 21.08% of Afghan refugees. Overall, disease burden 
      was more in females than males in Afghan refugee's population. To the best of our 
      knowledge, this is the first comprehensive report on health and disease status of 
      Afghan refugees and IDPs in Pakistan.

      diseases were excluded from the study. Levels of albumin and C3 complement were 
      measured by using Micro Lab 300 and ELISA, respectively; and the results were 
      compared by using SPSS version 21. groups, respectively (p=0.201). The mean serum 
      C3 levels were 1120.9+/-265 mug/ml and 2241.0+/-293 mug/ml in the control and 
      endometriosis patient groups, respectively (p <0.001). RESULTS: The mean serum 
      albumin levels were 4.62+/-0.88 g/dl and 4.42+/-0.52 g/dl in the control and 
      endometriosis Conclusion: Serum C3 complement were significantly increased in 
      endometriosis patients but not in controls; whereas, serum albumin levels were 
      not significantly different in endometriosis cases as compared to the controls.

AB  - Entomopathogenic fungi (EPFs), Isaria fumosorosea and Beauveria bassiana, are 
      efficient biological agents in the management of multiple arthropod pests. In 
      this study, the effects of both EPF species on various life stages of Spodoptera 
      litura (F.) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) and its natural enemy Rhynocoris marginatus 
      (Fab.) (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) were determined under laboratory conditions. I. 
      fumosorosea significantly (P < .05) reduced the growth rate of the third and 
      fourth instar larvae of S. litura. For relative consumption rate (RCR), the 
      maximum impact was recorded for I. fumosorosea, which reduced the RCR of the 
      larvae. The larvae of S. litura treated with I. fumosorosea showed significantly 
      lower efficiency of conversion of ingested food (ECI) and the larval mortality 
      rate (58.0%) was also higher compared with B. bassiana (33.3%). Similarly, I. 
      fumosorosea had a significant effect on the pupal formation of S. litura; 
      however, no significant effect was found on adult emergence percentage. To 
      determine the effect of EPF-infected prey on the adult predator, their handling 
      time, predatory rate, consumption rate, and the survival rate were recorded. No 
      significant effect of EPF species on the predation rate was found. Furthermore, 
      no significant difference was found in the survival rate of predators fed on 
      either EPF-infected prey or healthy larvae. The interaction of these EPFs with a 
      reduviid predator suggested that both EPF species, especially I. fumosorosea, 
      could be used together with the predator to boost the biological control of S. 
      litura in commercial crops.

TI  - Physical, ecological and human dimensions of environmental change in Brazil's 
      Pantanal wetland: Synthesis and research agenda.

AB  - The Pantanal is the world's largest freshwater wetland, located in the 
      geographical centre of South America. It is relatively well conserved, and 
      features unique landscapes, ecosystems, and traditional cultural practices, 
      shaped by the dynamic interaction of climatological, hydrological, geological, 
      ecological, and anthropogenic factors. Its ecological integrity is increasingly 
      threatened by human activities, particularly, in the wider catchment area, for 
      example, deforestation, agricultural intensification, and construction of 
      hydropower plants, with implications for local people's livelihoods. We present a 
      synthesis of current literature on physical, ecological, and human dimensions of 
      environmental change in the wetland, outline key research gaps, and discuss 
      environmental management implications. The literature review suggests that better 
      integration of insights from multiple disciplines is needed and that 
      environmental management could be improved through a better grounding in 
      traditional practices and local perspectives. We conclude with four 
      recommendations: First, future environmental change research should build more 
      strongly on the positive example of a small number of case studies where 
      traditional and local knowledge of the environment was put into a dialogue with 
      scientific knowledge and techniques. Second, we recommend a more explicit 
      consideration of longer temporal scales (>10 years) in environmental change 
      research, making use of oral and written histories, as well as palaeoecological 
      techniques, to understand system responses to different magnitudes of human and 
      climatic pressures, and ultimately, to inform future adaptation activities. 
      Third, we suggest that enhanced stakeholder participation in conceiving and 
      implementing research projects in the Pantanal would strengthen the practical 
      relevance of research in addressing environmental management challenges, 
      livelihood needs, and advocacy processes. Fourth, we call for a more systemic and 
      integrative perspective on environmental education, which encompasses engagement 
      activities between researchers, policy-makers, and citizens, to foster 
      environmental awareness, scientific literacy, and public participation.

TI  - Association of sociodemographic factors and emotional intelligence with academic 
      performance in clinical and preclinical dental courses.
PG  - 1109-1114
LID - 10.4103/njcp.njcp_37_19 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The dental graduation program is stressful and challenging as it is 
      essential to master various skills. The emotional intelligence (EI) is reported 
      to help in perceiving, moderating emotions and also play a significant role in 
      academic excellence. AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the 
      sociodemographic factors influencing EI and to determine the association of EI in 
      academic performance of clinical and preclinical courses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      This cross-sectional study included the 113 dental clinical internship students 
      from five different dental schools at Pakistan. The self-administered 
      questionnaire data included sociodemographic factors, academic performance in 
      preclinical, clinical courses, and San Diego City College MESA Program-based EI 
      responses. The results were analyzed with multiple linear regression and ordinal 
      regression to identify the independent predictor for EI and academic performance. 
      RESULTS: The female participants had marginally higher mean EI score (109.67) in 
      comparison to male counterparts (108.10). The independent predictors among 
      sociodemographic factors for EI were having siblings (P = 0.016), loss of parents 
      (P = 0.002), parents' education (P = 0.022), and relation with parents (P = 
      0.03). The students enjoy studying dentistry were also associated with higher EI 
      scores (P = 0.002). The mean EI score was an independent predictor of academic 
      performance predominantly in clinical courses [beta = -0.041 (95% confidence 
      interval - 0.063 to - 0.020); P = 0.000]. CONCLUSION: The finding of the study 
      indicates the influence of family and social factors in the development of EI. 
      The dental students' EI is vital for higher academic performance in clinical 
      courses.

TI  - Semantic preservation of standardized healthcare documents in big data.
PG  - 133-145
LID - S1386-5056(18)30845-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2019.05.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standardized healthcare documents have a high adoption rate in 
      today's hospital setup. This brings several challenges as processing the 
      documents on a large scale takes a toll on the infrastructure. The complexity of 
      these documents compounds the issue of handling them which is why applying big 
      data techniques is necessary. The nature of big data techniques can trigger 
      accuracy/semantic loss in health documents when they are partitioned for 
      processing. This semantic loss is critical with respect to clinical use as well 
      as insurance, or medical education. METHODS: In this paper we propose a novel 
      technique to avoid any semantic loss that happens during the conventional 
      partitioning of healthcare documents in big data through a constraint model based 
      on the conformance of clinical document standard and user based use cases. We 
      used clinical document architecture (CDAR) datasets on Hadoop Distributed File 
      System (HDFS) through uniquely configured setup. We identified the affected 
      documents with respect to semantic loss after partitioning and separated them 
      into two sets: conflict free documents and conflicted documents. The resolution 
      for conflicted documents was done based on different resolution strategies that 
      were mapped according to CDAR specification. The first part of the technique is 
      focused in identifying the type of conflict in the blocks that arises after 
      partitioning. The second part focuses on the resolution mapping of the conflicts 
      based on the constraints applied depending on the validation and user scenario. 
      RESULTS: We used a publicly available dataset of CDAR documents, identified all 
      conflicted documents and resolved all the them successfully to avoid any semantic 
      loss. In our experiment we tested up to 87,000 CDAR documents and successfully 
      identified the conflicts and resolved the semantic issues. CONCLUSION: We have 
      presented a novel study that focuses on the semantics of big data which did not 
      compromise the performance and resolved the semantic issues risen during the 
      processing of clinical documents.

TI  - Phragmites australis - a helophytic grass - can establish successful partnership 
      with phenol-degrading bacteria in a floating treatment wetland.
PG  - 1179-1186
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2018.01.014 [doi]
AB  - Helophytic plants contribute significantly in phytoremediation of a variety of 
      pollutants due to their physiological or biochemical mechanisms. Phenol, which is 
      reported to have negative/deleterious effects on plant metabolism at 
      concentrations higher than 500 mg/L, remains hard to be removed from the 
      environmental compartments using conventional phytoremediation procedures. The 
      present study aims to investigate the feasibility of using P. australis (a 
      helophytic grass) in combination with three bacterial strains namely 
      Acinetobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus cereus LORH97, and Pseudomonas sp. LCRH90, 
      in a floating treatment wetland (FTW) for the removal of phenol from contaminated 
      water. The strains were screened based on their phenol degrading and plant growth 
      promoting activities. We found that inoculated bacteria were able to colonize in 
      the roots and shoots of P. australis, suggesting their potential role in the 
      successful removal of phenol from the contaminated water. Pseudomonas sp. LCRH90 
      dominated the bacterial community structure followed by A. lowfii ACRH76 and B. 
      cereus LORH97. The removal rate was significantly high when compared with the 
      individual partners, i.e., plants and bacteria separately. The plant biomass, 
      which was drastically reduced in the presence of phenol, recovered significantly 
      with the inoculation of bacterial consortia. Likewise, highest reduction in 
      chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and total organic 
      carbon (TOC) is achieved when both plants and bacteria were employed. The study, 
      therefore, suggests that P. australis in combination with efficient bacteria can 
      be a suitable choice to FTWs for phenol-degradation in water.

AB  - Historically termed the "disease of kings and king of diseases," gout represents 
      one of the most prevalent etiologies of chronic inflammatory arthritis in the 
      United States. It is pathophysiologically defined by the presence of monosodium 
      urate (MSU) monohydrate crystals within joints and periarticular tissues. First 
      described by Hippocrates in ancient Greece, gout is among the most extensively 
      studied and clinically manageable rheumatic diseases. Gout is biochemically 
      characterized by the saturation of urate in the extracellular fluid, typically 
      reflected by hyperuricemia, with plasma or serum urate concentrations exceeding 
      6.8 mg/dL (approximately 400 micromol/L); this level is the approximate limit of 
      urate solubility in the blood. The clinical manifestations of gout may include: 
      Acute gout flare (recurrent flares of inflammatory arthritis). Chronic gouty 
      arthropathy. Accumulation of urate crystals in the form of tophaceous deposits. 
      Uric acid nephrolithiasis. Chronic nephropathy.

AB  - Interface engineering holds huge potential for enabling exceptional physical 
      properties in heterostructure materials via tuning properties at the atomic 
      level. In this study, a heterostructure built by a new redox stable semiconductor 
      SrFe(0.75)Ti(0.25)O(3-delta) (SFT) and an ionic conductor Sm(0.25)Ce(0.75)O(2) (SDC) 
      is reported. The SFT-SDC heterostructure exhibits a high ionic conductivity >0.1 
      S/cm at 520  degrees C, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that of bulk SDC. When 
      it was applied into the fuel cell, the SFT-SDC can realize favorable electrolyte 
      functionality and result in an excellent power density of 920 mW cm(-2) at 520 
       degrees C. The prepared SFT-SDC heterostructure materials possess both electronic and 
      ionic conduction, where electron states modulate local electrical field to 
      facilitate ion transport. Further investigations to calculate the structure and 
      electronic structure/state of SFT and SDC are done using density functional 
      theory (DFT). It is found that the reconstruction of the energy band at 
      interfaces is responsible for such enhanced ionic conductivity and cell power 
      output. The current study about the perovskite-based heterostructure presents a 
      novel strategy for developing advanced ceramic fuel cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malaria is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Pakistan is 
      considered as a moderate malaria-endemic country but still, 177 million 
      individuals are at risk of malaria. Roughly 60% of Pakistan's population, live in 
      malaria-endemic regions. The present study is based upon the survey of various 
      health care centers in 10 major cities of Northern and Southern Punjab to find 
      out the malarial infection patterns in 2015. The diagnosis, seasonal variations, 
      age and gender-wise distribution of Plasmodium spp. circulating in the study area 
      were also included in the objectives. METHODS: The malaria-suspected patients 
      '16075' were enrolled for malaria diagnosis using microscopy, out of which 925 
      were malaria positive which were processed for molecular analysis using nested 
      PCR. The 18S rRNA genes of Plasmodium species were amplified, sequenced, blast 
      and the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on sequences using online 
      integrated tool MEGA7. RESULTS: The 364 cases recruited from Northern Punjab with 
      the highest incidence in Rawalpindi (25.5%) and lowest in Chakwal (15.9%). From 
      Southern Punjab 561 cases were enlisted Rajanpur (21.4%) maximum and lowest from 
      Multan and Rahim Yar Khan (18%). The slide positivity rate, annual parasite 
      incidence, and annual blood examination rates were 5.7 per 1000 population, 0.1, 
      and 0.2% respectively. The only P. vivax (66.7%), P. falciparum (23.7%) and mixed 
      infection by these two species (9.6%) were diagnosed. The same trend (P. 
      vivax > P. falciparum > mixed infection) in species identification %age was 
      confirmed from molecular analysis. However, the occurrence of malaria was higher 
      in Southern Punjab (5.5%) as compared to the Northern Punjab (4.0%). The overall 
      malaria percentage occurrence of treatment-seeking patients in all recruited 
      cities of Punjab was 4.9%. The age-group of 1-20 and males among genders were 
      more affected by malaria. The comparison of different seasons showed that the 
      malaria infection was at a peak in Summer and post-monsoon. CONCLUSION: The 
      incidence of malaria was high in the flood infected rural areas of Southern 
      Punjab, Summer, and post-monsoon. The age group (1-20) and gender-wise males were 
      more affected by malaria.

TI  - Phragmites australis in combination with hydrocarbons degrading bacteria is a 
      suitable option for remediation of diesel-contaminated water in floating 
      wetlands.

AB  - The presence of diesel in the water could reduce the growth of plant and thus 
      phytoremediation efficacy. The toxicity of diesel to plant is commonly explained; 
      because of hydrocarbons in diesel accumulate in various parts of plants, where 
      they disrupt the plant cell especially, the epidemis, leaves, stem and roots of 
      the plant. This study investigated the effect of bacterial augmentation in 
      floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) on remediation of diesel oil contaminated 
      water. A helophytic plant, Phragmites australis (P. australis), was vegetated on 
      a floating mat to establish FTWs for the remediation of diesel (1%, w/v) 
      contaminated water. The FTWs was inoculated with three bacterial strains 
      (Acinetobacter sp. BRRH61, Bacillus megaterium RGR14 and Acinetobacter iwoffii 
      AKR1), possessing hydrocarbon degradation and plant growth-enhancing 
      capabilities. It was observed that the FTWs efficiently removed hydrocarbons from 
      water, and bacterial inoculation further enhanced its hydrocarbons degradation 
      efficacy. Diesel contaminated water samples collected after fifteen days of time 
      interval for three months and were analyzed for pollution parameters. The maximum 
      reduction in hydrocarbons (95.8%), chemical oxygen demand (98.6%), biochemical 
      oxygen demand (97.7%), total organic carbon (95.2%), phenol (98.9%) and toxicity 
      was examined when both plant and bacteria were employed in combination. Likewise, 
      an increase in plant growth was seen in the presence of bacteria. The inoculated 
      bacteria showed persistence in the water, root and shoot of P. australis. The 
      study concluded that the augmentation of hydrocarbons degrading bacteria in FTWs 
      is a better option for treatment of diesel polluted water.

TI  - Determining the association of high-commitment human resource practices with 
      nurses' compassionate care behaviour: A cross-sectional investigation.
PG  - 120-129

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the association of high-commitment 
      human resource practices (HCHRPs) with nurses' compassionate care behaviour. 
      BACKGROUND: The extant research highlights the key role of compassionate care 
      behaviour in achieving quality health services. However, scant attention has been 
      paid to identifying the factors that augment compassionate care behaviour among 
      health care professionals. METHODS: This study took place from September 2018 to 
      March 2019, collecting data from 340 nurses of either gender aged 24-60 years 
      with at least 1 year experience. The study follows a cross-sectional research 
      design by collecting data through a personally administered survey. RESULTS: A 
      statistically significant association was found between the four dimensions of 
      HCHRPs and organisational commitment. Moreover, organisational commitment 
      positively related to compassionate care behaviour and mediated the relationship 
      between HCHRPs and compassionate care behaviour. CONCLUSION: The findings reveal 
      that four dimensions of HCHRPs positively influence nurses' compassionate care 
      behaviour via the indirect path of organisational commitment. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING MANAGEMENT: The study marks the first attempt to delineate the role of 
      HCHRPs in enhancing the compassionate care behaviour. The hospital administration 
      and human resource managers should use HCHRPs as strategic imperative to attract 
      competent employees and enhance compassionate care behaviour.

AB  - Soil contamination due to cadmium (Cd) is a ubiquitous environmental problem for 
      which inexpensive remediation alternatives are required. Phytoaccumulation, the 
      use of plants to extract and accumulate heavy metals from the contaminated 
      environment, is such an alternative. In this study, we aimed at establishing 
      effective plant-bacteria interplay between Brachiaria mutica and Cd-resistant 
      endophytic bacteria eventually leading to improved phytoremediation. B. mutica 
      was grown in a Cd-contaminated soil and inoculated with three Cd-tolerant 
      endophytic bacteria individually as well as in combination. Plant physiological 
      parameters, biomass production, bacterial colonization, and Cd-accumulation were 
      observed at four different Cd exposures, i.e., 100, 200, 400 and 1000 mg kg(-1) 
      of soil. The combined application of endophytic bacteria was more effective as 
      compared to their individual applications at all concentrations. Nevertheless, 
      highest performance of consortium was seen at 100 mg Cd kg(-1) of soil, i.e., 
      root length was enhanced by 46%, shoot length by 62%, chlorophyll content by 40%, 
      and dry biomass by 64%; which was reduced with the increase in Cd concentration. 
      The bacterial population was highest in the root interior followed by rhizosphere 
      and shoot interior. Concomitantly, plants inoculated with bacterial consortium 
      displayed more Cd-accumulation in the roots (95%), shoots (55%), and leaves 
      (44%). Higher values of BCF(root) (> 1), and lower values for BCF(shoot) and TF 
      (< 1) indicates capability of B. mutica to accumulate high amounts of Cd in the 
      roots as compared to the aerial parts. The present study concludes that 
      plant-endophyte interplay could be a sustainable and effective strategy for Cd 
      removal from the contaminated soils.

TI  - Pendred Syndrome.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Pendred syndrome was first described in 1896 and is defined by a combination of 
      sensorineural hearing loss and thyroid goiter, with or without hypothyroidism. 
      This condition is most commonly caused by an autosomal recessive mutation in the 
      SLC26A4 gene, leading to a defect in the pendrin protein. Pendred syndrome 
      accounts for 7% to 15% of all cases of congenital deafness, typically presenting 
      as bilateral deafness. Most patients (66%) will also experience balance problems 
      due to an enlarged vestibular aqueduct. Hearing loss may not be complete at birth 
      and can progress stepwise during early childhood. Head trauma may accelerate 
      hearing deterioration in individuals with Pendred syndrome. Similarly, goiter may 
      not be clinically evident at birth and typically develops over late childhood to 
      early adulthood, even if the patient remains euthyroid. Regular thyroid 
      monitoring is therefore essential, even in asymptomatic individuals. Treatment 
      for Pendred syndrome is primarily symptomatic and supportive, and may include the 
      use of hearing aids, balance rehabilitation, and thyroid hormone supplementation. 
      Genetic counseling is also recommended to determine the carrier status and assess 
      the risk to other family members.

AB  - Here we compared the performance of four macrophytes namely Brachia mutica, Typha 
      domingensis, Phragmites australis and Leptochala fusca, in bacterially assisted 
      floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) for the clean-up of five trace metals (Fe, Mn, 
      Ni, Pb, and Cr) from polluted river water. The river water was artificially 
      spiked with reagent grade chemicals to increase the trace metal pollution. The 
      macrophytes were planted in a polystyrene sheet to prepare FTWs, which were 
      placed over the metal-contaminated river water. The consortium of five 
      rhizospheric and endophytic bacterial strains, i.e., Aeromonas salmonicida, 
      Pseudomonas indoloxydans, Bacillus cerus, Pseudomonas gessardii, and Rhodococcus 
      sp., was inoculated support the natural remediation ability. We found a 
      significant reduction in the metal content by all four macrophytes and the 
      removal was significantly enhanced when bacterial inoculum was applied. The 
      maximum removal was observed in FTWs planted with P. australis and inoculated 
      with bacteria. In this treatment (T6) the Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb and Cr contents were 
      reduced to 0.53, 0.20, 0.09, 1.04 and 0.07 mg L(-1) after five weeks retention 
      time. The bacterial inoculation sufficiently increased the plant biomass. All 
      macrophytes depicted potential to uptake and translocate trace metals in the 
      roots instead of shoots. The bacterial inoculation acclimatize the plants roots 
      followed by shoots and enhanced the uptake of metals by macrophytes. This study 
      emphasized the usefulness of macrophytes-bacteria mutualism in FTWs system for 
      the remediation of trace metals. The similar systems may provide practical 
      solutions for the remediation of trace metals of polluted river water.

TI  - Anthocyanins Potentially Contribute to Defense against Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.3390/molecules24234255 [doi]
LID - 4255
AB  - Anthocyanins (ANTs) are plant pigments that belong to a flavanol class of 
      polyphenols and have diverse pharmacological properties. These compounds are 
      primarily found in fruits and vegetables, with an average daily intake of 180 
      mgd(-1) of these compounds in the developed world. ANTs are potent antioxidants 
      that might regulate the free radical-mediated generation of amyloid peptides 
      (Abeta-amyloids) in the brain, which causes Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study 
      presents a literature review of ANTs from different berries and their potential 
      therapeutic value, with particular emphasis on neurodegenerative AD, which owing 
      to oxidative stress. This review also highlights reactive oxygen species (ROS) 
      generation through energy metabolism, nitrogen reactive species, the role of 
      transition metals in generating ROS, and the radical-quenching mechanisms of 
      natural antioxidants, including ANTs. The current status of the bioavailability, 
      solubility, and structure activity relationship of ANTs is discussed herein.

AB  - Inorganic nitrogen (N) inputs increase soil nitrification, acidification and 
      trace metal toxicity e.g. cadmium (Cd). Biochar (B) has been widely used for 
      metal immobilization. However, little is known about how the combination of N 
      fertilizers with biochar (N-B) changes soil Cd availability through altering 
      nitrification process. Here, (NH(4))(2)SO(4) or CO(NH(2))(2) was applied in 
      combination with biochar to an acidic, artificially enriched Cd contaminated 
      soil. Not as we expected, available Cd did not increase following (NH(4))(2)SO(4) 
      or CO(NH(2))(2) addition. Nitrification and acidification of Cd contaminated 
      soils were greatly inhibited, accompanied by elimination of ammonia-oxidizing 
      bacteria (AOB). Exchangeable H(+) of Cd contaminated soils was significantly 
      lower than that of uncontaminated soils, thus inhibiting Cd itself from 
      mobilization. N-B addition nearly halved soil available Cd and significantly 
      increased nitrification by promoting AOB recovery. However, the restored 
      nitrification did not cause soil acidification, due to the high buffering and 
      slow liming effects of biochar. Available Cd continuously decreased with 
      decreasing soil acidity and exchangeable Al. This study firstly demonstrated a 
      feedback between soil nitrification and Cd after N application, and how biochar 
      modified the feedback. Biochar, therefore, provides a feasible strategy for 
      eliminating potential Cd toxicity on both soil biological and chemical processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of miR-196a rs11614913 C/T genetic 
      variation and its target gene annexin A1 mRNA expression with breast cancer risk 
      in Pakistani female ethnicities. METHODS: This case control study, conducted from 
      March 2017 to November 2018 included 295 breast cancer patients, 295 controls of 
      three Pakistani ethnicities and archived 100 samples of cohort group for 
      genotyping and expression profiling. Genotyping of miR-196a (rs11614913 C/T) was 
      done by ARMS PCR technique. Annexin-A1 (ANXA1) mRNA expression was measured with 
      qRT-PCR and detection of protein expression of ANXA1 was done by 
      immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: CC homozygous genotype of miR-196a rs11614913 was 
      present in 81.4% of cases and 73.9% controls. C/T polymorphism was found to be 
      significantly associated with decrease risk of breast cancer (OR=0.25 (0.11- 
      0.58, p <0.05). Similar trend was seen with the minor T allele (OR=0.55 
      (0.39-0.77, p <0.05, and both dominant and recessive models (OR=0.64; p=0.02 and 
      OR=0.26, p=0.00). In the KPK ethnic group significant decrease association with 
      breast cancer risk was observed (OR= 0.22 (0.09-0.53, p < 0.05). 
      Immunohistochemical staining showed loss of ANXA1 protein expression in 72 
      samples, and significant association was observed with pathological type p=0. 00 
      and triple negative receptor status p=0.03 and with genotypes of miR-196a p=0.00. 
      Increase relative expression of 2.81+/- .88 by qPCR analysis of ANXA1 mRNA was 
      noted with TT genotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that miR-196a 
      rs11614913 C/T polymorphism is associated with a decreased risk and loss of 
      protein expression in breast cancer in the Pakistani population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The quality of health care is continuously improving and is expected 
      to improve further because of the advancement of machine learning and 
      knowledge-based techniques along with innovation and availability of wearable 
      sensors. With these advancements, health care professionals are now becoming more 
      interested and involved in seeking scientific research evidence from external 
      sources for decision making relevant to medical diagnosis, treatments, and 
      prognosis. Not much work has been done to develop methods for unobtrusive and 
      seamless curation of data from the biomedical literature. OBJECTIVE: This study 
      aimed to design a framework that can enable bringing quality publications 
      intelligently to the users' desk to assist medical practitioners in answering 
      clinical questions and fulfilling their informational needs. METHODS: The 
      proposed framework consists of methods for efficient biomedical literature 
      curation, including the automatic construction of a well-built question, the 
      recognition of evidence quality by proposing extended quality recognition model 
      (E-QRM), and the ranking and summarization of the extracted evidence. RESULTS: 
      Unlike previous works, the proposed framework systematically integrates the 
      echelons of biomedical literature curation by including methods for searching 
      queries, content quality assessments, and ranking and summarization. Using an 
      ensemble approach, our high-impact classifier E-QRM obtained significantly 
      improved accuracy than the existing quality recognition model (1723/1894, 90.97% 
      vs 1462/1894, 77.21%). CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed methods and evaluation 
      demonstrate the validity and rigorousness of the results, which can be used in 
      different applications, including evidence-based medicine, precision medicine, 
      and medical education.

      Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections.
PG  - 688-698
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.9b00565 [doi]
AB  - Necrotizing soft-tissue infections (NSTIs) have multiple causes, risk factors, 
      anatomical locations, and pathogenic mechanisms. In patients with NSTI, 
      circulating metabolites may serve as a substrate having impact on bacterial 
      adaptation at the site of infection. Metabolic signatures associated with NSTI 
      may reveal the potential to be useful as diagnostic and prognostic markers and 
      novel targets for therapy. This study used untargeted metabolomics analyses of 
      plasma from NSTI patients (n = 34) and healthy (noninfected) controls (n = 24) to 
      identify the metabolic signatures and connectivity patterns among metabolites 
      associated with NSTI. Metabolite-metabolite association networks were employed to 
      compare the metabolic profiles of NSTI patients and noninfected surgical 
      controls. Out of 97 metabolites detected, the abundance of 33 was significantly 
      altered in NSTI patients. Analysis of metabolite-metabolite association networks 
      showed a more densely connected network: specifically, 20 metabolites 
      differentially connected between NSTI and controls. A selected set of 
      significantly altered metabolites was tested in vitro to investigate potential 
      influence on NSTI group A streptococcal strain growth and biofilm formation. 
      Using chemically defined media supplemented with the selected metabolites, 
      ornithine, ribose, urea, and glucuronic acid, revealed metabolite-specific 
      effects on both bacterial growth and biofilm formation. This study identifies for 
      the first time an NSTI-specific metabolic signature with implications for 
      optimized diagnostics and therapies.

AB  - Based on progress for the green synthesis of nanoparticle (NPs), the mushrooms 
      have also been utilized extensively for the biogenic synthesis of NPs. In recent 
      years, silver NPs have been fabricated using mushrooms. The antimicrobial drugs 
      are efficient to control the infectious diseases, but due to widespread of drugs, 
      microbes became resistant to drugs, which demands develop of new bioactive 
      agents. The silver NPs have been recognized as efficient broad spectrum 
      antimicrobial agents, which have been fabricated using polysaccharides from 
      mushrooms as reducing and capping agent. This review focused on the comprehensive 
      study that deals silver NPs polysaccharides from Pleurotus mushroom, their 
      synthesis mechanism, action mechanism of silver NPs and their characterization 
      using advanced techniques i.e., ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), dynamic light 
      scattering, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning 
      electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM) and XRD. The Pleurotus mushroom showed promising 
      efficiency for the biogenic synthesis of polysaccharides‑silver NPS and 
      as-prepared NPs showed excellent antimicrobial activity.

LID - 10.5455/JPMA.296507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare serum levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine between 
      premenopausal and postmenopausal women, and to evaluate its relationship with 
      time since onset of menopause. METHODS: The cross-sectional comparative study was 
      conducted at Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from 
      April 2017 to March 2018, and comprised individuals recruited from the 
      Gynaecology and Obstetrics outpatient department of the Pakistan Railway Hospital 
      in the city. The subjects were divided into two groups; pre-menopausal women in 
      Group I and postmenopausal in Group II. Group II was subdivided into three 
      categories according to time since onset of menopause. Serum asymmetric 
      dimethylarginine levels were estimated in each subject. Data was analysed using 
      SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 80 subjects, there were 40(50%) in Group I with a mean 
      age of 36.256.8 years, 40(50%) in Group II with a mean age of49.834.35 years. 
      There was a significant increase in mean asymmetric dimethylarginine levels in 
      Group II compared to Group I (p<0.05). There was also a significant increase in 
      asymmetric dimethylarginine levels with increase in duration since the onset of 
      menopause (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine increased 
      significantly after menopause.

AB  - Caudal anesthesia is a widely used regional anesthetic technique known for its 
      effectiveness in providing both perioperative and postoperative analgesia. This 
      procedure can be used as the primary anesthetic or as an adjunct to general 
      anesthesia. This technique is especially beneficial for pediatric patients 
      undergoing subumbilical surgeries and for adults managing chronic low back pain. 
      A retrospective study by Dalens and Hasnaoui, analyzing 750 caudal blocks 
      performed in children, reported a success rate of 96%. With advancements in 
      imaging technologies, such as fluoroscopy and ultrasound guidance, the accuracy 
      of caudal epidural needle placement has significantly improved, leading to 
      reduced block failure rates.

AB  - Amongst the various types of cancer, breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous 
      disease and known as the leading cause of death among women globally. The 
      extensive interdisciplinary investigation in nanotechnology and cancer biomedical 
      research has been evolved over the years for its effective treatment. However, 
      the advent of chemotherapeutic resistance in breast cancer is one of the major 
      confront researchers are facing in achieving successful chemotherapy. Research in 
      the area of cancer nanotechnology over the years have now been revolutionized 
      through the development of smart polymers, lipids, inorganic materials and 
      eventually their surface-engineering with targeting ligands. Moreover, 
      nanotechnology further extended and brings in the notice the new theranostic 
      approach which combining the therapy and imaging simultaneously. Currently, 
      research is being envisaged in the area of novel nano-pharmaceutical design viz. 
      liposome, nanotubes, polymer lipid hybrid system, which focuses to make the 
      chemotherapy curative and long-lasting. In this review, we aimed to discuss the 
      recent advancement of different surface-engineered/targeted nanomedicines that 
      improved the drug efficacy in breast cancer.

TI  - Legume genomics and transcriptomics: From classic breeding to modern 
      technologies.
PG  - 543-555
LID - 10.1016/j.sjbs.2019.11.018 [doi]
AB  - Legumes are essential and play a significant role in maintaining food standards 
      and augmenting physiochemical soil properties through the biological nitrogen 
      fixation process. Biotic and abiotic factors are the main factors limiting legume 
      production. Classical breeding methodologies have been explored extensively about 
      the problem of truncated yield in legumes but have not succeeded at the desired 
      rate. Conventional breeding improved legume genotypes but with more resources and 
      time. Recently, the invention of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and 
      high-throughput methods for genotyping have opened new avenues for research and 
      developments in legume studies. During the last decade, genome sequencing for 
      many legume crops documented. Sequencing and re-sequencing of important legume 
      species have made structural variation and functional genomics conceivable. NGS 
      and other molecular techniques such as the development of markers; genotyping; 
      high density genetic linkage maps; quantitative trait loci (QTLs) identification, 
      expressed sequence tags (ESTs), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); and 
      transcription factors incorporated into existing breeding technologies have made 
      possible the accurate and accelerated delivery of information for researchers. 
      The application of genome sequencing, RNA sequencing (transcriptome sequencing), 
      and DNA sequencing (re-sequencing) provide considerable insights for legume 
      development and improvement programs. Moreover, RNA-Seq helps to characterize 
      genes, including differentially expressed genes, and can be applied for 
      functional genomics studies, especially when there is limited information 
      available for the studied genomes. Genome-based crop development studies and the 
      availability of genomics data as well as decision-making gears look be specific 
      for breeding programs. This review mainly presents an overview of the path from 
      classical breeding to new emerging genomics tools, which will trigger and 
      accelerate genomics-assisted breeding for recognition of novel genes for yield 
      and quality characters for sustainable legume crop production.

TI  - Geo-Social Top-k and Skyline Keyword Queries on Road Networks.
LID - 10.3390/s20030798 [doi]
LID - 798
AB  - The rapid growth of GPS-enabled mobile devices has popularized many 
      location-based applications. Spatial keyword search which finds objects of 
      interest by considering both spatial locations and textual descriptions has 
      become very useful in these applications. The recent integration of social data 
      with spatial keyword search opens a new service horizon for users. Few previous 
      studies have proposed methods to combine spatial keyword queries with social data 
      in Euclidean space. However, most real-world applications constrain the distance 
      between query location and data objects by a road network, where distance between 
      two points is defined by the shortest connecting path. This paper proposes 
      geo-social top-k keyword queries and geo-social skyline keyword queries on road 
      networks. Both queries enrich traditional spatial keyword query semantics by 
      incorporating social relevance component. We formalize the proposed query types 
      and appropriate indexing frameworks and algorithms to efficiently process them. 
      The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches are evaluated using 
      real datasets.

TI  - Microbial L-asparaginase: purification, characterization and applications.
PG  - 967-981
LID - 10.1007/s00203-020-01814-1 [doi]
AB  - L-asparaginase (E.C.3.5.1.1) is an important enzyme that has been purified and 
      characterized for over decades to study and evaluate its anti-carcinogenic 
      activity against different lymphoproliferative disorders such as acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Hodgkin's lymphoma. The ability of the enzyme to 
      convert L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia is the reason behind its 
      anti-cancerous activity. Apart from its medicinal uses, it is widely used in food 
      industry to tackle acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen and, production in 
      carbohydrate-rich foods cooked at high temperatures. There are variety of 
      organisms including microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, algae, and plants 
      that produce L-asparaginase. The enzyme obtained from different microbial and 
      plant sources have different physiochemical properties and kinetic parameters. 
      L-asparaginases have an optimum pH range between 6 and 10 and an optimum 
      temperature between 37 and 85  degrees C. This article has reviewed the lowest molecular 
      mass for L-asparaginase in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Q66CJ2 which is 36.27 kDa, 
      while the highest for Pseudomonas otitidis which has a molecular mass of 
      205 +/- 3 kDa. This review is an attempt to summarize most of the available 
      sources, their phylogenetic relationships, purification methods, data regarding 
      different physiochemical and kinetic properties of L-asparaginase.

AB  - Pakistan is ranked among the most climate change adversely affected countries of 
      the world due to facing higher frequency of extreme natural hazards events as 
      floods, drought, and earthquakes. Inadequate mitigation measures regarding 
      severity and consecutive events of floods have badly affected millions of 
      households' livelihoods. Pakistan has experienced five consecutive floods in the 
      current decade from 2010 to 2015. These floods severely affected the mostly 
      districts of Punjab province among these three most flood-affected districts 
      Rahim Yar Khan, Muzaffargarh, and Rajanpur were selected for this research work. 
      This study used the cross-sectional data of 840 flood-affected households from 
      these three districts. Empirical estimates indicated the study area households 
      major adaptation measures were foundation strengthen, elevated ground floor, 
      precautionary saving, and construction of the house with reinforced material. 
      Probit model estimates signified age, gender, location, and family size; monthly 
      income, physical disability, education, and house ownership were major factors 
      influencing mitigation strategies of households' level. Limited resources, 
      inadequate planning for land use, lack of advanced and early warning system, and 
      inadequate sound financial status were major obstacles regarding households' 
      level adaptation of mitigation strategies. In addressing household level 
      obstacles regarding advanced adaptation measures, development requires for local 
      disaster policies such as ample spatial planning, codes of house building, 
      practices of building infrastructure, propagation and forecasting updated flood 
      information, and advanced and updated early warning system.

PG  - 743-754

AB  - Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an emerging health problem involving 1 out of 
      every 68 children. The incidence rate of autism has increased 3 folds during the 
      last 3 decades. Due to the illusive picture of aetiology, a considerable number 
      of autistic children fail to receive proper behavioural and medicational 
      treatment. The present study provides a cumulative account of autism risk 
      factors. Several factors including the gene expression and gene mutations, 
      environmental pollution, metal ion accumulation, exposure to pesticides, immune 
      deficiencies, viral infections, mother's age, health, mental status, mother's 
      interactions with the foetus, vaccination of mother and children, and modulations 
      in gut microbiota have been debated. These risk factors may contribute to the 
      development of autism either independently or synergistically leading to a broad 
      spectrum of characteristics observed in autistic patients. The variable 
      quantitative influence of a wide spectrum of risk factors may result in a unique 
      set of features in each autistic individual. However, the exact mechanism behind 
      the combined impact of various aetiological factors is poorly understood 
      hindering the adaptation of specified and effective therapies.

AB  - Fluid compartments in the human body are divided into intracellular and 
      extracellular spaces. The extracellular space accounts for approximately 
      one-third of total body water and is further divided into intravascular plasma 
      volume (25%) and the extravascular interstitial space (75%). Fluid balance 
      between these compartments is governed by hydrostatic and oncotic pressures, as 
      described by Starling's law. Hydrostatic pressure drives fluid out of the 
      capillaries, while oncotic pressure, primarily maintained by proteins such as 
      albumin, pulls fluid back into the capillaries, ensuring proper fluid 
      distribution. Additional key factors influencing fluid balance include vessel 
      wall permeability and the lymphatic system, which has a vital role in returning 
      excess interstitial fluid and proteins to the circulation. Disruptions in this 
      system-whether due to increased capillary filtration or impaired lymphatic 
      drainage-can result in fluid accumulation, leading to edema. Edema may present as 
      localized swelling, such as from an insect bite, or as widespread fluid retention 
      (anasarca), as seen in conditions such as nephrotic syndrome. In contrast to 
      localized edema, generalized edema typically does not become clinically apparent 
      until the interstitial volume increases by 2.5 to 3 liters. This is because the 
      tissues in the interstitial space are highly flexible and can accommodate several 
      liters of fluid without visible swelling. Consequently, a patient's weight may 
      increase by nearly 10% before pitting edema is evident, indicating that the 
      body's capacity to manage excess fluid has been exceeded.

AB  - Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is an emerging neglected tropical disease in Azad 
      Jammu and Kashmir which is an underdeveloped area. Prevalence and parasite 
      species identification are the key factors to control disease in a particular 
      population, which were the objectives of the present study. Due to a lack of 
      previous data, we performed a district-based active CL surveillance in 2018. The 
      data of CL, suspected (n = 20,000) cases were analyzed statistically and 
      identified the parasite species in microscopic positive cases by ITS1-PCR RFLP 
      and also obtained accession numbers MN891719-28 from gene Bank. The phylogenetic 
      tree was constructed using MEGA6 software. Out of 20,000 CL, suspected cases the 
      highest rate of 4.02% (135/3360) of CL in Mirpur and the lowest 1.58% (8/505) in 
      Neelum was reported. The slide positivity rate, annual parasite incidence rate 
      and annual blood examination rate were 2.27 per 1000 population, 0.08 and 0.34%. 
      The males were more infected 58.12% (297/511) than females 41.88% (214/511) and 
      the age group of 1-20 years were found highly infected 82.78% (423/511) than 
      21-40 years 13.89% (71/511) and 41-60 years 3.33% (17/511) in the studied 
      population. The patients 56.36% (288/511) had a single lesion whereas 29.35% 
      (150/511) had two, only 10.76% (31/288) and 8% (12/150) were using bed nets. The 
      patients 14.29% (73/511) had three or more lesions were not using bed nets. Only 
      27.98% (143/511) patients had received treatment, while 72.02% (368/511) didn't. 
      Microscopically positive cases were found to be 2.56% (511/20,000) and ITS1-PCR 
      positive cases were found to be 91.39% (467/511). The RFLP assay confirmed the 
      presence of Leishmania tropica in 467 samples.

PG  - 390-393
LID - 10.5455/JPMA.296490 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphism in 
      three CC, TT and TC genotypes of transforming growth factor beta1 T29C in breast 
      cancer patients. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted from April 2017 to 
      April 2018 at the Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in 
      collaboration with Nuclear Oncology Medicine and Radiotherapy Institute and Holy 
      Family Hospital, Rawalpindi. Using convenience sampling, breast cancer cases and 
      healthy controls were enrolled. All investigations were done using standardized 
      laboratory protocols. The outcomes were determined in terms of association of 
      single nucleotide polymorphism of transforming growth factor beta1with breast 
      cancer. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 150 subjects, 80(53.3%) 
      were cases and 70(47.7%) were healthy controls. Among the cases, the most 
      frequent genotype was CC 38(47.5%) followed by TC 26(32.5%) and TT 16(20%). Among 
      the controls, the corrsesponding values were 50(71.42%), 13(18.5%) and 7(10%). 
      Transforming growth factor beta1 TC genotype was strongly associated with the 
      increased risk of developing breast cancer (odds ratio: 3.79). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      incidence of breast cancer was markedly lower among women with CC genotype 
      compared to those with CT or TT genotypes.

TI  - Genetic characterization of peste des petits ruminants virus (Pakistani isolates) 
      and comparative appraisal of diagnostic assays.

AB  - This study was designed to characterize N gene sequences of peste des petits 
      ruminants virus (PPRV) isolates circulating in Pakistan and to evaluate the 
      efficacy of available diagnostic assays on local isolates. During the study 
      period, a total of sixty PPR outbreaks were investigated. A total of 20 selected 
      samples from these outbreaks were sequenced for N gene. The result analysis and 
      the phylogenetic trees indicated two different viral groups in N gene: one was 
      closer to China and Tajikistan, while other group was similar to isolates from 
      Iran and Saudi Arabia. Efficacy of three commercially available tests for the 
      antigen detection of PPR, that is, peste test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was 
      compared. Keeping PCR as gold standard, sensitivity was calculated as 85% and 57% 
      and specificity was calculated as 83% and 79% for ELISA and peste test, 
      respectively. Value of K for ELISA was 0.67 which indicates good agreement 
      between ELISA and RT-PCR. Value of K for peste test was 0.33 which indicates fair 
      agreement between peste test and RT-PCR. In conclusion, study provides premier 
      information about the use of different diagnostic tests and molecular situation 
      of PPRV in Pakistan.

AB  - Farming community confronted with sundry type of risks while production and 
      environmental risks are more significant. Farms management decisions and 
      operations are considerably influenced by farmers' perceptions and attitude to 
      risks. Risk management issues specific to cereals crops not properly focused in 
      developing countries specifically to Pakistan, so this gap tried to address in 
      this study. This research work was spotlighted to quantify farmers' perception 
      and attitude of diverse form of risks toward rice crop in Pakistan. The present 
      study used cross-sectional data of 450 rice farmers categorized as low, medium, 
      and high production base six rice districts of Punjab, Pakistan. In attempting to 
      identify farmers attitude to risk, the study used Equally Likely Certainty 
      Equivalent approach, as farmers' perception were ranked in four catastrophic risk 
      basis, rice diseases, high input prices, drought, and heavy rainfall and hail, by 
      risk matrix. In estimating the factors influencing farmers' attitude and 
      perceptions to risk, the study used Probit model. Farmers believe heavy rainfall 
      and hails, high input prices, drought, and rice disease major threats for rice 
      crop while mostly farmer is risk-averse behavior as indicated in the results of 
      the study. Estimates of the study signified as education, gender, size of farm, 
      religious, age, credit, off-farm income, farmer livestock, and experience of 
      farming significantly influences farmer risk perception and risk attitude. This 
      research provided applied and suitable investigation for farming community, 
      extension services, researchers, agricultural policymakers, and insurance 
      institutions. Farmers confronting risk and their attitude need to understand by 
      researcher and policymakers' access them accurate information regarding 
      sophisticated tools of risk management and risks to make sure the provision of 
      advance extension services and agricultural finance. In formulating applied 
      policy measures, it is prerequisite for researchers and policymakers to accurate 
      understanding of local environmental conditions, crop-related threats, and 
      farmers' perceptions and attitude.

TI  - Risk Versus Benefit of Combined Aspirin and Warfarin Therapy in Patients With 
      Atrial Fibrillation.
PG  - 766-773
LID - 10.1177/0897190020916638 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Guidelines have differing recommendations for aspirin use in patients 
      with an indication for anticoagulation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 
      the incidence of major bleeding and thromboembolic events (TEs) in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation (AF) receiving warfarin alone (monotherapy group) versus 
      warfarin plus aspirin (combination therapy group). METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective, cohort study including patients from a pharmacist-run 
      anticoagulation clinic. Inclusion criteria were patients with AF receiving 
      anticoagulation between January 2013 and January 2014 observed over 5 years. 
      RESULTS: One hundred forty-two patients were included in the combination group 
      versus 89 in monotherapy group. In the combination group, 60 (42.3%) patients 
      were on aspirin for no apparent indication, 19 (13.4%) had stable coronary artery 
      disease and diabetes, and 26 (18.3%) had diabetes alone. Major bleeding occurred 
      in 21 (14.9%) patients in the combination group versus 7 (7.9%) patients in the 
      monotherapy group (odds ratio [OR] = 2.02, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 
      0.78-5.91; P = .17). TE occurred in 10 (7%) patients in the combination group 
      versus 4 (4.5%) in the monotherapy group (OR = 1.61, 95% CI: 0.44-7.24; P = .57). 
      There was no significant difference in bleeding (P = .85) or TE (P = .37) rates 
      between aspirin indications in the combination group. CONCLUSION: Combination 
      therapy versus monotherapy may increase bleeding risk with little benefit in 
      decreasing AF-related stroke or cardiovascular events.

TI  - Response to First Course of Intensified Immunosuppression in Genetically 
      Stratified Steroid Resistant Nephrotic Syndrome.
PG  - 983-994
LID - 10.2215/CJN.13371019 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intensified immunosuppression in steroid-resistant 
      nephrotic syndrome is broadly applied, with disparate outcomes. This review of 
      patients from the United Kingdom National Study of Nephrotic Syndrome cohort 
      aimed to improve disease stratification by determining, in comprehensively 
      genetically screened patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, if there 
      is an association between response to initial intensified immunosuppression and 
      disease progression and/or post-transplant recurrence. DESIGN, SETTING, 
      PARTICIPANTS, & MEASUREMENTS: Pediatric patients with steroid-resistant nephrotic 
      syndrome were recruited via the UK National Registry of Rare Kidney Diseases. All 
      patients were whole-genome sequenced, whole-exome sequenced, or steroid-resistant 
      nephrotic syndrome gene-panel sequenced. Complete response or partial response 
      within 6 months of starting intensified immunosuppression was ascertained using 
      laboratory data. Response to intensified immunosuppression and outcomes were 
      analyzed according to genetic testing results, pattern of steroid resistance, and 
      first biopsy findings. RESULTS: Of 271 patients, 178 (92 males, median onset age 
      4.7 years) received intensified immunosuppression with response available. A 
      total of 4% of patients with monogenic disease showed complete response, compared 
      with 25% of genetic-testing-negative patients (P=0.02). None of the former 
      recurred post-transplantation. In genetic-testing-negative patients, 97% with 
      complete response to first intensified immunosuppression did not progress, 
      whereas 44% of nonresponders developed kidney failure with 73% recurrence 
      post-transplant. Secondary steroid resistance had a higher complete response rate 
      than primary/presumed resistance (43% versus 23%; P=0.001). The highest complete 
      response rate in secondary steroid resistance was to rituximab (64%). Biopsy 
      results showed no correlation with intensified immunosuppression response or 
      outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with monogenic steroid-resistant nephrotic 
      syndrome had a poor therapeutic response and no post-transplant recurrence. In 
      genetic-testing-negative patients, there was an association between response to 
      first intensified immunosuppression and long-term outcome. Patients with complete 
      response rarely progressed to kidney failure, whereas nonresponders had poor 
      kidney survival and a high post-transplant recurrence rate. Patients with 
      secondary steroid resistance were more likely to respond, particularly to 
      rituximab.

AB  - The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has a diverse fauna due to its peculiar 
      position bordering the Afrotropical, Oriental and Palaearctic zoogeographic 
      zones. The present study reports the phylogenetics of five mosquito species 
      belonging to five series of Anopheles (Cellia) . We collected mosquito larvae 
      from eastern, western and southwestern regions of KSA. The sampled mosquitoes 
      were morphologically identified using the pictorial keys of mosquitoes and 
      characterized by using single and multi-locus analysis of -internal transcribed 
      spacer 2 (ITS2) region and cytochrome oxidase c subunit I (COI). Based on the 
      morphological and molecular data, five species were recognized, like An. 
      stephensi (Neocellia) (Oriental), An. arabiensis (Pyretophorus) (Afrotropical), 
      An. dthali (Myzomyia) (Oriental and Palaearctic), An. cinereus (Paramyzomyia) and 
      An. rhodesiensis rupicola (Neomyzomyia) (Oriental and Palaearctic). The 
      phylogenetic analysis showed that An. stephensi is a monophyletic species with 
      different ecotypes found in different geographic regions. Comprehensive 
      phylogenetics and population genetics studies are crucial for a better 
      understanding of the role of these five mosquito species in malarial transmission 
      across various zoogeographic zones of different ecological and demographic 
      characteristics.

TI  - Transgenerational phenotypic plasticity of diapause induction and related fitness 
      cost in a commercial strain of the parasitoid Aphidius ervi Haliday.
PG  - 780-792
LID - 10.1111/1744-7917.12794 [doi]
AB  - Diapause is an adaptation that insects have evolved to synchronize their life 
      cycle with that of seasonal climatic changes and resources availability. However, 
      cues for its induction are not always clear and, in some cases, a maternal effect 
      may be involved. At the population level, just a part of the individuals may 
      exhibit diapause with important consequences in terms of winter survival. 
      Moreover, clear indicators of diapause state are difficult to identify. Diapause 
      induction was thus investigated in the aphid parasitoid species Aphidius ervi 
      Haliday (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) developing in the aphid Sitobion avenae 
      (Hemiptera: Aphididae) at four crossed photothermal regimes (16  degrees C and 8  degrees C, 16:8 
      h L:D and 8:16 h L:D), and during 2 successive generations. We analyzed the 
      reliability of changes in mummy color to assess for the diapausing state compared 
      to dissections, and we measured parasitoid morphological and physiological 
      traits. We observed that the proportion of dark brown mummies increased after one 
      generation under low photothermal regime compared to other regimes. No diapause 
      was recorded at 16  degrees C, 16:8 h L:D, while we observed 16.2% and 67.5% diapause 
      incidence at 8  degrees C, 8:16 h L:D, at 1st and 2nd generation, respectively. Diapause 
      induction is thus increased by short day-length conditions and low temperatures 
      as well as by maternal effects. All parasitoid life-history traits (weight, size, 
      fat content, water content, egg-load, and longevity) were affected by the 
      photothermal regime and/or the generation. These results raise new questions on 
      the environmental thresholds needed to induce diapause and on survival and 
      adaptation potential of commercially available parasitoid strains in different 
      environments.

TI  - Role of rivaroxaban in sunitinib-induced renal injuries via inhibition of 
      oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and inflammation through the tissue nacrosis 
      factor-alpha induced nuclear factor-kappaappa B signaling pathway in rats.
PG  - 361-370
LID - 10.1007/s11239-020-02123-6 [doi]
AB  - Rivaroxaban (RIVA) inhibits factor Xa and exhibits antithrombotic and 
      anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting several cellular signaling molecules. 
      Sunitinib (SUN) is FDA approved first-line drug for metastatic renal cancers and 
      advanced cancerous states of gastrointestinal tract. Present hypothesis was aimed 
      to examine the nephroprotective potential of RIVA in SUN-induced nephrotoxicity, 
      mediated through the inhibition of oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and 
      inflammation, via the TNF-alpha/NFk-B signaling pathways. Wistar rats 200-250 g were 
      selected and divided randomely in 5 groups (n = 6): Group 1 kept as normal 
      control; Group 2 as disease control and exposed to SUN 50 mg/kg thrice-weekly 
      upto 21 days; Groups 3 and 4, were treatment groups and administered SUN 50 mg/kg 
      thrice-weekly as of group 2 and treated with RIVA 5 and 10 mg/kg/daily for 
      21 days, respectively; and Group 5 fed with RIVA alone (10 mg/kg/daily for 
      21 days). Serum was separated from blood to estimate serum biochemical parameters 
      and kidney tissues were collected to estimate antioxidant enzyme, mRNA and 
      protein expression. SUN exposure significantly elevated levels of creatinine, 
      urea, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, albumin, and bilirubin, and decreased serum 
      magnesium and iron levels. Malondialdehyde and catalase levels were significantly 
      increased and glutathione and glutathione reductase levels were significantly 
      decreased. Intracellular levels of caspase-3 and TNF-alpha were significantly 
      increased; RIVA treatment restored the altered levels. In SUN-exposed animals, 
      western blotting revealed significantly elevated NFk-B, IL-17, and MCP-1 
      expression, and IKBalpha levels were significantly downregulated; RIVA restored these 
      levels to normal values.RIVA treatment significantly restored the apoptotic and 
      inflammatory parameters in SUN-damaged renal tissues.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance against present antibiotics is rising at an alarming rate 
      with need for discovery of advanced methods to treat infections caused by 
      resistant pathogens. Silver nanoparticles are known to exhibit satisfactory 
      antibacterial and antibiofilm activity against different pathogens. In the 
      present study, the AgNPs were synthesized chemically and characterized by 
      UV-Visible spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. 
      Antibacterial activity against MDR K. pneumoniae strains was evaluated by agar 
      diffusion and broth microdilution assay. Cellular protein leakage was determined 
      by the Bradford assay. The effect of AgNPs on production on extracellular 
      polymeric substances was evaluated. Biofilm formation was assessed by tube method 
      qualitatively and quantitatively by the microtiter plate assay. The cytotoxic 
      potential of AgNPs on HeLa cell lines was also determined. AgNPs exhibited an MIC 
      of 62.5 and 125 mug/ml, while their MBC is 250 and 500 mug/ml. The production of 
      extracellular polymeric substance decreased after AgNP treatment while cellular 
      protein leakage increased due to higher rates of cellular membrane disruption by 
      AgNPs. The percentage biofilm inhibition was evaluated to be 64% for K. 
      pneumoniae strain MF953600 and 86% for MF953599 at AgNP concentration of 
      100 mug/ml. AgNPs were evaluated to be minimally cytotoxic and safe at 
      concentrations of 15-120 mug/ml. The data evaluated by this study provided 
      evidence of AgNPs being safe antibacterial and antibiofilm compounds against MDR 
      K. pneumoniae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Researchers have confirmed that chronic administration of drugs at 
      high doses causes genotoxicity which serve as first step in development of 
      cancers. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor is Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) approved drug for Psoriatic Arthritis. The present study 
      designed to conduct genotoxicity testing using the genotoxic study which give 
      simple, sensitive, economical and fast tools for the assessment of damage of 
      genetic material. METHODS: To conduct genotoxicity study of Apremilast, 60 Swiss 
      albino male mice divided into 6 groups (n = 10). Group1 served as a normal 
      control group without any treatment, Group 2 treated as a disease control and 
      administered with cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg, IP. Group 3, 4, 5 and 6 treated as 
      test groups and received 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day Apremilast respectively. The 
      total duration of study was 13 weeks. At termination day animals were sacrificed 
      and chromosomal aberration assay (BMCAA) and micronucleus assay (BMMNA) were 
      performed to know the genotoxicity potential of Apremilast. RESULTS: The results 
      indicates significant rise in chromosomal aberrations (CA) frequency in bone 
      marrow cells and decrease in the MI of the disease control animals as well as 
      Apremilast treated groups. Further significant (p < 0.001; p < 0.0001) increase 
      in score of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) and percentage of 
      micronucleated PCEs per 1000 PCEs and decrease in the ratio of 
      polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) was observed in micronucleus 
      assay. Genotoxic effect increases with the increase of Apremilast dose. 
      Conclusion: Finding of present indicates that Apremilast shows genotoxic 
      potential on high administration although further detailed toxicity studies 
      required for confirmations.

TI  - Protein kinase CK2 impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis in prostate 
      cancer.
PG  - 131-143
LID - 10.1007/s11010-020-03752-4 [doi]
AB  - Protein kinase CK2 plays multiple roles in cell function in normal and disease 
      states. CK2 is elevated in numerous types of cancer cells, and CK2 suppression of 
      apoptosis represents a key link to the cancer cell phenotype. CK2 regulation of 
      cell survival and death involves diverse processes, and our previous work 
      suggested that mitochondrial machinery is a key locus of this function. One of 
      the earliest responses of prostate cells to inhibition of CK2 is a change in 
      mitochondrial membrane potential, possibly associated with Ca(2+) signaling. 
      Thus, in the present work, we investigated early impact of CK2 on intracellular 
      Ca(2+) dynamics. Three prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines, PC3-LN4, C4-2B, and 
      22Rv1, were studied. PCa cells were treated with the CK2 small molecule 
      inhibitors 4,5,6,7-tetrabrombenzotriazole and CX-4945 followed by analysis of 
      Ca(2+) levels in various cellular compartments over time. The results showed 
      dose-dependent loss in cytosolic Ca(2+) levels starting within 2 min and reaching 
      maximal loss within 5-10 min. There was a concomitant increase in Ca(2+) in the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial compartments. The results suggest 
      that inhibition of CK2 activity results in a rapid movement of Ca(2+) out of the 
      cytosol and into the ER and mitochondria, which may be among the earliest 
      contributory factors for induction of apoptosis in cells subjected to inhibition 
      of CK2. In cells with death-inducing levels of CK2 inhibition, total cellular 
      Ca(2+) levels dropped at 2 h post-treatment. These novel observations represent a 
      potential mechanism underlying regulation of cell survival and death by CK2 
      activity.

TI  - Climate change adaptation impact on cash crop productivity and income in Punjab 
      province of Pakistan.

AB  - Assessing the current farm-level efforts of climate change adaptation is 
      essential to distinguish their usefulness and implying policy level advance 
      measures for future. The present study investigated cotton farmers' climate 
      change adaptation and its impact on increasing cotton productivity and net cotton 
      income in Punjab province of Pakistan. A pretested and well-structured 
      questionnaire was used for data collection of 480 cotton farmers from three major 
      cotton-producing divisions of cotton-wheat zone of Punjab, Pakistan. Logistic 
      regression analysis approach was used in this study to find out the factors of 
      adaptation and propensity score matching method employed to identify connecting 
      adaptation impact on cotton productivity and cotton income. Empirical estimates 
      of this study indicated as owing to some external and internal constraint farmers 
      were limited focused on adaptation while conscious about adverse effects of 
      climate change. Usage of required and recommended types of fertilizer, variation 
      in planting dates, and changing varieties of crop were main adaptation strategies 
      implemented by cotton farmers. Cotton farmers' adaptation decision was 
      significantly influenced by some major factors as weather forecasting, market 
      information, easy access to agricultural extension services, farming experience, 
      and education of cotton farmer. Farm-level increase in cotton productivity and 
      net cotton crop income was direct while overall increases in national output and 
      improving rural area farmer well-being were indirect and significant outcomes of 
      implementing climate change adaptation of cotton farmers. Cotton farmers were 
      using various combinations of adaptation strategies and achieving more benefits 
      regarding their crop productivity and net returns. Findings of the study suggest 
      need for larger investment in farm-level extension services, farmers' schooling, 
      and develop climate change institutional setup for enhancing farmers' adaptation 
      capability to increasing cotton productivity, improving well-being of farming 
      community, and securing agriculture from future climatic uncertainties. Future 
      policies must deal with farm-level limitations of advanced adaptation measures 
      like making available information and sustaining sponsoring soil conservation 
      practices, launching climate smart varieties and advanced adaptation measures 
      based on various agro-ecological zones.

TI  - Peripheral Expression of CXCL10 Gene in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients Treated with 
      Sofosbuvir, Daclatasvir, and Ribavirin.
PG  - 301-309

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes persistent infection and invades host's innate and 
      adaptive immune systems. During the eradication of this pathogen, the components 
      of immune system may cause bystander damage to host, which might be even worse 
      than the viral pathogenesis. Thus, the therapy should not only eliminate primary 
      virus infection but also improve the inflammatory immune responses. The 
      breakthrough of interferon free direct acting antiviral (DAA) drugs has provided 
      the opportunity to unravel the association of HCV with immune response. This 
      study aimed to examine the expression level of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 
      (CXCL10) in the Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HCV infected 
      patients treated with DAAs + Ribavirin. In this study we analyzed the expression 
      levels of CXCL10 mRNA in the 90 chronic HCV patients using quantitative PCR 
      (qPCR) prior, after, and during therapy with sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF+RBV) and 
      sofosbuvir/daclatasvir/ribavirin (SOF+DCV+RBV), and further, the results were 
      analyzed relative to treatment response. Significantly elevated CXCL10 mRNA was 
      seen in naive patients having higher viral load (P = 0.005) and those suffering 
      from hepatocellular carcinoma (P = 0.006). HCV patients had remarkable decline in 
      CXCL10 level after 4, 12, and 24 weeks of therapy with DAAs. An approximate 
      one-fold decrease was observed in patients who attained sustained virological 
      response compared to untreated patients (P < 0.0001). Comparing the 2 regimens, 
      the reduction in peripheral CXCL10 expression was more pronounced in patients 
      undergoing SOF+DCV+RBV therapy. The current study implicitly shows the role of 
      CXCL10 as an indicator of disruption of host-virus equilibrium and consequent 
      pathogenesis of HCV during successful antiviral therapy. Furthermore, the drop in 
      CXCL10 level after HCV viral clearance might reflect the DAA-induced alleviation 
      in the extrahepatic manifestation of this infection.

TI  - Formulation of Chitosan Polymeric Vesicles of Ciprofloxacin for Ocular Delivery: 
      Box-Behnken Optimization, In Vitro Characterization, HET-CAM Irritation, and 
      Antimicrobial Assessment.

AB  - Ciprofloxacin is a commonly used antibiotic for treatment of bacterial 
      conjunctivitis. The conventional eye drop dosage form is the widely used mode of 
      treatment, but it has low corneal residence time. This drawback can be overcome 
      by developing a bioadhesive noisome system (chitosan-coated) for enhanced corneal 
      residence time. The niosomes were prepared by thin-film hydration technique and 
      optimized by using Box-Behnken statistical design software. Cholesterol (A), Span 
      60 (B), and sonication time (C) were selected as independent variables, whereas 
      vesicle size (Y(1) in nm), entrapment efficiency (Y(2) in %), and drug release 
      (Y(3) in %) were chosen as dependent variables. The vesicle size, entrapment 
      efficiency, and drug release of optimized CIP niosomes (CIP-NSMopt) were found to 
      be 180.34 +/- 5.13 nm, 78.32 +/- 4.49%, and 82.87 +/- 4.01% (in 12 h), respectively. 
      Further CIP-NSMopt was coated with different chitosan concentrations (0.1 to 
      0.3%) to enhance mucoadhesion. Finally, optimized chitosan-coated niosomes 
      (chitosomes; CIP-CHTopt) showed a vesicle size of 210.65 +/- 2.76 nm, zeta 
      potential of - 35.17 +/- 2.25Mv, and PDI of 0.221. CIP-CHTopt exhibited sustained 
      release profile (75.31% in 12 h) with the Korsmeyer-Peppas kinetic model 
      (R(2) = 0.980). The permeation study showed 1.79-fold enhancements in corneal 
      permeation compared with marketed CIP eye drop. The hen's egg chorioallantoic 
      membrane (HET-CAM) study showed 0 scores (no irritation), and it was further 
      confirmed by corneal hydration and histopathology study. The antimicrobial study 
      exhibited a significant high zone (P < 0.05) of inhibition against tested 
      organism. Our findings demonstrated that chitosan-coated niosomes are a promising 
      drug carrier to enhance corneal contact time and treatment of bacterial 
      conjunctivitis.

AB  - The title compound, C(19)H(17)NO(5), obtained by ether bond formation between the 
      reagents, crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P2(1)/c. The compound is 
      non-planar, subtending a dihedral angle of 82.38 (4) degrees  between the plane of 
      hy-droxy isophthalate-based ester and that of the benzo-nitrile moiety. The 
      mol-ecule is bent at the ether linkage, with a C(ar-yl)-O-C(ar-yl) bond angle of 
      116.74 (11) degrees . In the crystal, mol-ecules are linked by C-Hcdots, three dots, centeredO hydrogen bonds and 
      other weak inter-actions forming a supra-molecular framework. A Hirshfeld surface 
      analysis was performed to generate two-dimensional fingerprint plots, which 
      reveal the type of inter-actions occurring in the vicinity of the mol-ecule.

AB  - The bronchodilator effects of Roflumilast "a selective phosphodiesterase type-4 
      (PDE4)" inhibitor studied in this experimental protocol. The spiral strips of 
      isolated guinea-pig tracheal chains mounted in organ bath and maintained in Krebs 
      solution ventilated with carbogen at 32  degrees C and in Ca(++) restricted krebs 
      solution. PDE inhibitory activity was evaluated by recording dose response curves 
      using inhibitory effect of isoprenaline on CCh induced contractions. For 
      confirmation of PDE inhibition the intracellular cAMP levels were also estimated. 
      Roflumilast resulted a sharp inhibition in contractile responses of carbachol 
      (CCh, 1 microM) and K(+) (80 mM) and the results were almost similar to verapamil. In 
      Ca(++) restricted Krebs solution, a rightward shift in the Ca(++) response curves 
      observed in the tracheal chain strips which were pretreated with Roflumilast 
      (0.001-0.003 mg/mL) and the maximum response was suppressed, similarly as with 
      verapamil. PDE inhibitory effect of Roflumilast evaluated by recording 
      dose-dependent (0.03-0.1 mg/mL) responses, the isoprenaline-induced inhibitory 
      dose response curves shifted leftward similar to papaverine (PDE inhibitor). 
      Pretreatment with Roflumilast exhibited elevated intracellular cAMP levels in 
      tracheal strips. Findings of the experiment conclude bronchodilatory influence of 
      Roflumilast via PDE and Ca(++) channel inhibition. Results of current experiment 
      offers comprehensive mechanistic background of Roflumilast in future as 
      therapeutic bronchodilator for hyperactive bronchial airway diseases.

TI  - Potential Mechanism of Dermal Wound Treatment With Preparations From the Skin Gel 
      of Arabian Gulf Catfish: A Unique Furan Fatty Acid (F6) and Cholesta-3,5-Diene 
      (S5) Recruit Neutrophils and Fibroblasts to Promote Wound Healing.

AB  - Preparations from Arabian Gulf catfish (Arius bilineatus, Val) epidermal gel 
      secretion (PCEGS) effectively heal chronic wounds in diabetic patients. However, 
      specific lipid components of PCEGS that are responsible for various aspects of 
      wound healing are unknown. Here, we report for the first time that, i) a unique 
      preparation containing only proteins and lipids (Fraction B, FB), derived from 
      the PCEGS accelerated the healing of experimental dermal wounds in female rats 
      (transdermal punch biopsy) in vivo. Histological analyses showed that topical 
      treatment of these wounds with FB promoted the migration of fibroblasts, 
      facilitated the production of extracellular matrix (collagen, fibronectin), 
      induced capillary formation and recruitment of immune cells, and accelerated 
      overall wound healing by day 4 (tested at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10 days; n=15 for 
      vehicle; n=15 for FB treatment), ii) the lipids responsible for different stages 
      of wound healing were separated into a protein-free bioactive lipid fraction, Ft, 
      which contained a few common long-chain fatty acids, a unique furan fatty acid 
      (F6) and a cholesterol metabolite, cholesta-3,5-diene (S5). Ft (the partially 
      purified lipid fraction of PCEGS), and F6 and S5 present in Ft, proved to be 
      bioactive for wound healing in human dermal fibroblasts. Ft increased the 
      production and extracellular deposition of collagen and fibronectin, ex vivo, 
      iii) Ft and its subcomponents, pure F6 and S5, also promoted human dermal 
      fibroblast migration into the scratch wound gaps, ex vivo, iv) Ft, F6, and S5 
      promoted the recruitment of neutrophils (Green fluorescence protein labeled) to 
      the site of injury in the transected tailfins of transgenic zebrafish, in vivo, 
      v) Ft, but not F6 or S5, promoted the regeneration of tissues at the wound site 
      in the transgenic zebrafish tailfin, in vivo. Therefore, we conclude that lipid 
      fraction Ft from PCEGS contains the components necessary to promote complete 
      wound healing, and F6 and S5 are responsible for promoting fibroblast and 
      neutrophil recruitment to the site of wounds.

AB  - PURPOSE: The present study was designed to study the gentamycin (GTM)-loaded 
      stimulus-responsive chitosan nanoparticles to treat bacterial conjunctivitis. 
      METHODS: GTM-loaded chitosan nanoparticles (GTM-CHNPs) were prepared by 
      ionotropic gelation method and further optimized by 3-factor and 3-level 
      Box-Behnken design. Chitosan (A), sodium tripolyphosphate (B), and stirring speed 
      (C) were selected as independent variables. Their effects were observed on 
      particle size (PS as Y1), entrapment efficiency (EE as Y2), and loading capacity 
      (LC as Y3). RESULTS: The optimized formulation showed the particle size, 
      entrapment efficiency, and loading capacity of 135.2+/-3.24 nm, 60.18+/-1.65%, and 
      34.19+/-1.17%, respectively. The optimized gentamycin-loaded chitosan nanoparticle 
      (GTM-CHNPopt) was further converted to the stimulus-responsive sol-gel system 
      (using pH-sensitive carbopol 974P). GTM-CHNPopt sol-gel (NSG5) exhibited good 
      gelling strength and sustained release (58.99+/-1.28% in 12h). The corneal 
      hydration and histopathology of excised goat cornea revealed safe to the cornea. 
      It also exhibited significant (p<0.05) higher ZOI than the marketed eye drop. 
      CONCLUSION: The finding suggests that GTM-CHNP-based sol-gel is suitable for 
      ocular delivery to enhance the corneal contact time and improved patient 
      compliance.

TI  - Bacterial bioaugmentation enhances hydrocarbon degradation, plant colonization 
      and gene expression in diesel-contaminated soil.
PG  - 58-66

AB  - Environmental contamination by hydrocarbons is a major problem, and hydrocarbon 
      accumulation in soil poses hazardous threat to ecosystems. Phytoremediation, 
      which involves plants, is an encouraging technique for the removal of 
      hydrocarbons from polluted soil and water. The purpose of this investigation was 
      to examine whether bacterial inoculation enhanced the phytoremediation of 
      hydrocarbons in diesel-contaminated soil vegetated with maize (Zea mays L.). The 
      two cultivars of maize, MMRI Yellow and Pearl White, were planted in 
      diesel-polluted soil (0, 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5 g diesel kg(-1) soil), and inoculated 
      with the consortium of three alkane-degrading bacterial strains, Arthrobacter 
      oxydans ITRH49, Pseudomonas sp. ITRI73 and Pseudomonas sp. MixRI75. Bacterial 
      inoculation enhanced plant growth and hydrocarbon degradation. Between two 
      cultivars, MMRI Yellow showed better growth and hydrocarbon degradation in the 
      presence and absence of bacterial inoculation. Maximum hydrocarbon degradation 
      (80%) was observed in the soil having minimum concentration of diesel 
      (1.5 g kg(-1) soil), and vegetated with bacterial inoculated MMRI Yellow maize 
      cultivar. Furthermore, more bacterial colonization, and abundance and expression 
      of the alkane hydroxylase gene (alkB) were observed in the root interior than in 
      the rhizosphere and shoot interior of the plants. The bacteria-mediated 
      phytoremediation of soil contaminated with hydrocarbons suggested that the 
      collective use of plants and bacteria was the most beneficial approach for the 
      reclamation of diesel-contaminated soil in comparison with vegetation alone.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and association of Glutathione S-Transferase 
      Theta 1 and Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 1 null genotypes in development of 
      actinic keratosis (AK) in a group of Pakistani population. STUDY DESIGN: 
      Case-control analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of 
      Biochemistry, Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi in collaboration 
      with Department of Dermatology, Railway Hospital and Rural Health Center, 
      District Health Office, Rawalpindi from September 2018 to September 2019.  
      Methodology: A total of 86 participants were included in this study with 27 
      biopsy proven cases of AK and 59 matched controls. Blood samples were collected 
      after obtaining written informed consent; and DNA was extracted by Chelex 
      method. Multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was done to find respective allelic frequencies of 
      GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in both cases and controls.  Results: Mean age of 
      participants in cases and controls was 62.93 +/-10.29 years and was 61.42 +/-9.96 
      years, respectively. There were 18 males (66.7%) and 9 females (33.3%); and 43 
      males (72.9%) and 16 females (27.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. There 
      was a significant association of GSTT1 null genotype with AK (OR: 2.72, 95% CI: 
      1.05-7.05, p = 0.037). There was a positive correlation between GSTT1 null 
      genotype and AK (r = 0.225, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: GSTT1 null genotype has a 
      significant association for AK development in the studied Pakistani population.

PG  - 85
LID - 10.1121/10.0001495 [doi]
AB  - The analysis of fluid-structure coupled waveforms and the attenuation of these 
      waveforms in a flexible waveguide is carried out. The physical configuration 
      contains an expansion chamber connected by an extended inlet/outlet by means of 
      vertical lined flanges. The governing boundary value problem is solved by using 
      Mode-Matching (MM) technique. The associated eigen expansions of field potentials 
      include non-orthogonal eigenfunctions and the related eigen-sub-systems are 
      classified in the non-Sturm Liouville category, whereby the use of generalized 
      orthogonal characteristics has ensured the point-wise convergence of solution. 
      The low frequency approximation (LFA) which relies on the limited propagating 
      modes is developed and is compared with MM solution. In the low frequency regime, 
      a good agreement between MM and LFA results is found. Furthermore, the numerical 
      experiments are performed to analyze the effects of absorbent linings and edge 
      conditions on the attenuation of flexural modes. The guiding structure is exited 
      with the structure-borne mode incident as well as the fluid-borne mode incident. 
      It is found that the use of edge conditions and the absorbent linings 
      significantly affect the attenuation of structure-borne mode and fluid-borne 
      mode, respectively.

AB  - The present study was planned to understand the heavy metal burden and its 
      possible actions in blood of occupational females working at brick kilns at 
      Rawat, Pakistan. A total of 232 women were included in the study, of which 114 
      presented control subjects. Apart from collection of demographic data, fertility 
      indicators and body mass index (BMI), blood was collected from subjects that was 
      later used for the determination of heavy metal concentrations using atomic 
      absorption spectroscopy and haematological profile. Blood was centrifuged and 
      plasma was obtained and stored at - 20 degrees  to study biochemical variables (sodium 
      dismutase, peroxidase, reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive 
      species, protein estimation), lipid profile and cortisol concentrations among the 
      two groups. Analysis of heavy metal in blood showed elevated levels of cadmium 
      (3.09 +/- 0.01 mug/dl), chromium (4.20 +/- 0.02 mug/dl) and nickel (5.59 +/- 0.03 mug/dl) 
      in worker's group as compared with control. Increased platelet count; decreased 
      antioxidant enzyme and increased oxidants level; increased total cholesterol, 
      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG); decreased total protein and 
      high-density lipoprotein (HDL); and increased cortisol levels were evident among 
      workers as compared with the control group. The study concluded that occupational 
      workers experience increased heavy metals burden in blood and, therefore, pose a 
      risk to human health by causing reduction in antioxidant enzymes 
      concentration and increase in stress conditions.

AB  - The role of the human microbiome in the brain and behavioral development is an 
      area of increasing attention. Recent investigations have found that diverse 
      mechanisms and signals including the immune, endocrine and neural associations 
      are responsible for the communication between gut microbiota and the brain. The 
      studies have suggested that alteration of intestinal microbiota using probiotic 
      formulations may offer a significant role in the maturation and organization of 
      the brain and can shape the brain and behavior as well as mood and cognition in 
      human subjects. The understanding of the possible impact of gut microflora on 
      neurological function is a promising phenomenon that can surely transform the 
      neurosciences and may decipher the novel etiologies for neurodegenerative and 
      psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Effect of nursing led discharge instructions on improvement of post discharge 
      care management in heart failure patients at tertiary care hospital of Karachi, 
      Pakistan.

LID - 10.5455/JPMA.10911 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the impact of nursing discharge instructions on 
      post-discharge care management in heart failure patients. METHODS: The quasi- 
      experimental non-randomized study was conducted at the National Institute of 
      Cardiovascular Diseases, Karachi, from January to December 2017, and comprised 
      in-patients suffering from heart failure. They were divided into two equal 
      groups. In the intervention group, discharge instructions and written material 
      was thoroughly given by the nurses other than routine existing instructions for 
      effective post-discharge care management. The control group received discharged 
      instructions under existing routine. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of 
      the 80 patients, there were 40(50%) in each group with no significant difference 
      in terms of age, gender and education (p>0.05 each). Regarding awareness and 
      control of the disease, adherence with medication and proper management of their 
      illness, the intervention group had higher level of competency than the control 
      group (p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Provision of nursing interventions to educate the 
      patient of heart failure during hospitalisation, on discharge, follow-up day and 
      continuous guidance on telephone significantly improved the post-discharge care 
      management of the patients.

LID - 10.1007/s11010-020-03891-8 [doi]
AB  - In recent times cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of mortality 
      universally, caused more or less 17.7 million casualties with 45% of all 
      illnesses (except communicable ones) in 2015 as per World Health Organization 
      (WHO). According to American National Center for Health Statistics, cardiac 
      disorders are costliest. Moreover, health care expenditures related to cardiac 
      disorders are anticipated to exceed than diabetes and Alzheimer's. Straining of 
      reactive oxygen species with diminished neutralization & inflammation critically 
      adds to atherosclerosis and also proceed to other cardiovascular diseases such as 
      cardiac remodeling and myocardial infarction (MI). In the past few years, 
      researchers revealed multiple drug targets from animal studies and evaluated them 
      in the therapeutics of cardiac disorders, which offered exciting clues for novel 
      therapeutic strategies. Although, only few newer agents approved clinically and 
      actual approaches for treatment are lagging behind. Several novel drugs found 
      effective for the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, cardiac 
      arrhythmia and angina pectoris. Detailed mechanism of action, basic and clinical 
      pharmacology of all novel drugs has been discussed in this review.

      Injury.
PG  - e9347
LID - 10.7759/cureus.9347 [doi]
LID - e9347
AB  - Olmesartan-induced spruelike enteropathy is a rare clinical entity that is 
      characterized by unexplained chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Prompt recognition 
      of this adverse event may be challenging due to clinical and histologic 
      similarities with other small intestinal pathologies. We hereby delineate the 
      case of an elderly female with a 14-month clinical history of non-bloody diarrhea 
      and weight loss. After extensive diagnostic workup and exclusion of probable 
      etiologies, the patient was diagnosed with olmesartan-associated enteropathy. A 
      dramatic clinical and histologic recuperation was achieved after discontinuation 
      of olmesartan. This paper illustrates the overarching need for a detailed 
      clinical history focusing on medication review in patients presenting with 
      chronic diarrhea with no obvious cause. The spruelike enteropathy associated with 
      olmesartan is an emerging cause of small bowel injury. Clinicians should maintain 
      a high index of suspicion for this adverse drug reaction. Early and correct 
      diagnosis carries paramount importance in sparing these patients from unnecessary 
      diagnostic investigations and therapeutic delays.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Validation and verification are the critical 
      requirements for the knowledge acquisition method of the clinical decision 
      support system (CDSS). After acquiring the medical knowledge from diverse 
      sources, the rigorous validation and formal verification process are required 
      before creating the final knowledge model. Previously, we have proposed a hybrid 
      knowledge acquisition method with the support of a rigorous validation process 
      for acquiring medical knowledge from clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and 
      patient data for the treatment of oral cavity cancer. However, due to lack of 
      formal verification process, it involves various inconsistencies in knowledge 
      relevant to the formalism of knowledge, conformance to CPGs, quality of 
      knowledge, and complexities of knowledge acquisition artifacts. METHODS: This 
      paper presents the refined knowledge acquisition (ReKA) method, which uses the Z 
      formal verification process. The ReKA method adopts the verification method and 
      explores the mechanism of theorem proving using the Z notation. It enhances a 
      hybrid knowledge acquisition method to thwart the inconsistencies using formal 
      verification. RESULTS: ReKA adds a set of nine additional criteria to be used to 
      have a final valid refined clinical knowledge model. These criteria ensure the 
      validity of the final knowledge model concerning formalism of knowledge, 
      conformance to GPGs, quality of the knowledge, usage of stringent conditions and 
      treatment plans, and inconsistencies possibly resulting from the complexities. 
      Evaluation, using four medical knowledge acquisition scenarios, shows that newly 
      added knowledge in CDSS due to the additional criteria by the ReKA method always 
      produces a valid knowledge model. The final knowledge model was also evaluated 
      with 1229 oral cavity patient cases, which outperformed with an accuracy of 
      72.57% compared to a similar approach with an accuracy of 69.7%. Furthermore, the 
      ReKA method identified a set of decision paths (about 47.8%) in the existing 
      approach, which results in a final knowledge model with low quality, 
      non-conformed from standard CPGs. CONCLUSION: ReKA refined the hybrid knowledge 
      acquisition method by discovering the missing steps in the current validation 
      process at the acquisition stage. As a formally proven method, it always yields a 
      valid knowledge model having high quality, supporting local practices, and 
      influenced by standard CPGs. Furthermore, the final knowledge model obtained from 
      ReKA also preserves the performance such as the accuracy of the individual source 
      knowledge models.

AB  - Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a conserved mitotic serine-threonine protein kinase, 
      functions as a regulatory protein, and is involved in the progression of the 
      mitotic cycle. It plays important roles in the regulation of cell division, 
      maintenance of genome stability, in spindle assembly, mitosis, and DNA-damage 
      response. PLK1 is consist of a N-terminal serine-threonine kinase domain, and a 
      C-terminal Polo-box domain (regulatory site). The expression of PLK1 is 
      controlled by transcription repressor in the G1 stage and transcription 
      activators in the G2 stage of the cell cycle. Overexpression of PLK1 results in 
      undermining of checkpoints causes excessive cellular division resulting in 
      abnormal cell growth, leading to the development of cancer. Blocking the 
      expression of PLK1 by an antibody, RNA interference, or kinase inhibitors, causes 
      a subsequent reduction in the proliferation of tumour cells and induction of 
      apoptosis in tumour cells without affecting the healthy cells, suggesting an 
      attractive target for drug development. In this review, we discuss detailed 
      information on expression, gene and protein structures, role in different 
      diseases, and progress in the design and development of PLK1 inhibitors. We have 
      performed an in-depth analysis of the PLK1 inhibitors and their therapeutic 
      implications with special focus to the cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Wheat consumption can trigger celiac disease, allergic reactions and non-celiac 
      wheat sensitivity (NCWS) in humans. Some people with NCWS symptoms claim a better 
      tolerability of spelt compared to bread wheat products. We therefore investigated 
      potential differences in the proteomes of spelt and bread wheat flour using nano 
      LC-ESI-MS/MS on a set of 15 representative varieties for each of the two species. 
      Based on the bread wheat reference, we detected 3,050 proteins in total and for 
      most of them the expression was mainly affected by the environment. By contrast, 
      274 and 409 proteins in spelt and bread wheat, respectively, had a heritability 
      >/= 0.4 highlighting the potential to influence their expression level by varietal 
      choice. We found 84 and 193 unique proteins for spelt and bread wheat, 
      respectively, and 396 joint proteins, which expression differed significantly 
      (p </= 0.05) when comparing both species. Thus, about one third of proteins 
      differed significantly between spelt and bread wheat. Of them, we identified 81 
      proteins with high heritability, which therefore might be interesting candidates 
      for future research on wheat hypersensitivities.

AB  - Conjunctivitis is considered as a common infection of ocular surfaces. Eye drop 
      is most commonly used for treatment of conjunctivitis, but has some drawback like 
      95% drug eliminated after administration. Administration of levofloxacin to the 
      anterior site in form of chitosan coated poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) 
      nanoparticles (LFV-CS-PLGA-NPs) expected to overcome these problem and increasing 
      corneal contact time and permeability for effective treatment of bacterial 
      conjunctivitis. The Nanoparticles were developed by single emulsion solvent 
      evaporation technique and optimized for different variables (chitosan, poly 
      (lactide-co-glycolic acid) and polyvinyl alcohol concentration) by employing 
      three factors, three levels Box-Behnken statistical design. The nanoparticles 
      were evaluated for particle size, drug loading, entrapment efficiency, drug 
      release, ex-vivo permeation, ocular tolerance, antimicrobial study, confocal 
      laser microscopy, and Gamma scintigraphy study. The particle size and PdI of the 
      optimized nanoparticles were 169.968 +/- 15.23 nm and 0.13 +/- 0.03, respectively, 
      where as entrapment efficiency and drug loading is 49.54 +/- 2.43% and 11.29 +/- 
      2.13% with extended release profile and strong mucoadhesion. DSC data indicated 
      levofloxacin formed molecular dispersion within coated nanoparticles. Corneal 
      flux showed significantly (P < 0.05) higher permeation as compared to marketed 
      formulation. Formulation was nonirritant and possessed good antibacterial 
      activity. Gamma Scintigraphy showed slow drainage compared to drug solution, 
      indicating reduction in nasolachrymal drainage. The Gamma Scintigraphy study 
      indicated the CS coated PLGA-NPs have high corneal residence time as compared to 
      drug solution. So, it is revealed that LFV-CS-PLGA-NPs increase the drug 
      concentration over ocular tissue and potential usefulness for sustained drug 
      delivery.

TI  - A comparative study on dissolution rate of sintered (Th-U)O(2) pellets in by 
      microwave and conventional heating.
PG  - 622-627
LID - 10.1039/c0ay00630k [doi]
AB  - ThO2 with approximately 3% 233UO2 is the proposed fuel for the Advanced Heavy 
      Water Reactor (AHWR) and characterized as a mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. Due to the 
      existence of a single oxidation state, quantitative dissolution of MOX samples 
      like (Th-U)O2 and (Th-Pu)O2 is a challenging task for any analytical chemist. 
      However, dissolution is a pre-requisite for complete characterization of the 
      fuel. The present paper describes a detailed study carried out on the comparison 
      of dissolution of sintered (Th-U)O2 mixed oxide pellets, in 16 M HNO3 using 
      microwave and conventional heating techniques, under reflux conditions. The study 
      was carried out with variation of parameters such as concentration of HF and UO2 
      substitution in the MOX solid solution. The concentration of dissolved U and Th 
      was determined by modified Davies and Gray potentiometric titration and Th-EDTA 
      complexometric titration using xylenol orange as the titration end point 
      indicator respectively. Experimental results clearly indicate that the microwave 
      heating assisted dissolution rate is 2 to 3 times higher than the conventional 
      infrared heating assisted dissolution rate, for sintered pellets. The 
      concentration of HF is a critical parameter, an excess leads to precipitation of 
      insoluble ThF4. The concentration of HF was optimized to 0.025 M. Experimental 
      results also clearly show that at this concentration of HF in 16 M HNO3, a higher 
      substitution of UO2 in MOX solid solution also facilitates the dissolution 
      process. Different trace metal impurities were determined in the MOX samples 
      after dissolving by microwave and infra red heating techniques and it was 
      observed that the results are comparable.

AB  - Myocardial infarction (MI) continues to be the leading cause of death 
      globally. It involves irreversible necrosis of the cardiac muscle due to reduced 
      blood supply caused by the occlusion of coronary arteries. MI represents a 
      significant but preventable contributor to morbidity and mortality rates. 
      Clinically, the diagnosis of myocardial infarction is established when there is 
      an elevation in cardiac biomarkers, coupled with evidence of acute myocardial 
      ischemia, which can include angina, electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, or 
      echocardiographic evidence of wall motion abnormalities. Anterior wall myocardial 
      infarction (AWMI) occurs when there is a reduction in blood supply to the 
      anterior wall of the heart, resulting from occlusion of the left anterior 
      descending artery (LAD). Anterior myocardial infarction is associated with 
      higher mortality and morbidity than other acute myocardial infarctions locations. 
      It is linked to increased in-hospital mortality, greater reduction in left 
      ventricle ejection fraction, and a higher incidence of congestive heart failure 
      compared to infarctions occurring in other areas of the heart. Anterior 
      myocardial infarction can be classified into different categories based on the 
      anatomical location of the occlusion in the left anterior descending (LAD) 
      artery. These categories are as follows: 1. Proximal LAD: Proximal to first 
      septal perforator. On ECG findings, ST elevation is evident in leads V1-V6, I, 
      and aVL. It may also present as a new bundle branch block or a fascicular block. 
      2. Mid-LAD: Distal to the first septal perforator but proximal to the first large 
      diagonal branch. ECG findings reveal ST elevation in leads V1-V6, I, and aVL. 
      Bundle branches are usually preserved. 3. Distal LAD: Distal to large diagonal or 
      large diagonal itself. ECG findings show ST elevation in leads V1-V4, I, aVL, V5, 
      or V6.

AB  - The dynamic control of the chemical concentration within droplets is required in 
      numerous droplet microfluidic applications. Here, we propose an acoustofluidic 
      method for the generation of a library of aqueous droplets with the desired 
      chemical concentrations in a continuous oil phase. Surface acoustic waves 
      produced by a focused interdigital transducer interact with two parallel laminar 
      streams with different chemical compositions. Coupling the acoustic waves with 
      the flow streams results in the controlled acoustofluidic mixing of the aqueous 
      solutions through the formation of acoustic streaming flow-induced microvortices. 
      The mixed streams are split at a bifurcation, and one of the streams with a 
      precisely controlled chemical concentration is fed into a T-junction to produce 
      droplets with tunable chemical concentrations. The periodic acoustofluidic mixing 
      of the aqueous streams enables the generation of a droplet library with a 
      well-defined inter-droplet concentration gradient. The proposed method is a 
      promising tool for the on-chip dynamic control of in-droplet chemical 
      concentrations and for next-generation droplet microfluidic applications.

AB  - Traditional medicines contain natural products (NPs) as main ingredient which 
      always give new direction and paths to develop new advanced medicines. In the 
      COVID-19 pandemic, NPs can be used or can help to find new compound against it. 
      The SARS coronavirus-2 main protease (SARS CoV-2 M(pro)) enzyme, arbitrate viral 
      replication and transcription, is target here. The study show that, from the 
      electronic features and binding affinity of all the NPs with the enzyme, the 
      compounds with higher hydrophobicity and lower flexibility can be more favorable 
      inhibitor. More than fifty NPs were screened for the target and one terpenoid 
      (T3) from marine sponge Cacospongia mycofijiensis shows excellent SARS CoV-2 
      M(pro) inhibitory activity in comparison with known peptide based inhibitors. The 
      molecular dynamics simulation studies of the terpenoids with the protein 
      indicates that the complex is stable and hydrogen bonds are involved during the 
      complexation. Considering binding affinity, bioavailability, pharmacokinetics and 
      toxicity of the compounds, it is proposed that the NP T3 can act as a potential 
      drug candidate against COVID-19 virus.

TI  - Clinical Context-Aware Biomedical Text Summarization Using Deep Neural Network: 
      Model Development and Validation.
PG  - e19810
LID - 10.2196/19810 [doi]
LID - e19810
AB  - BACKGROUND: Automatic text summarization (ATS) enables users to retrieve 
      meaningful evidence from big data of biomedical repositories to make complex 
      clinical decisions. Deep neural and recurrent networks outperform traditional 
      machine-learning techniques in areas of natural language processing and computer 
      vision; however, they are yet to be explored in the ATS domain, particularly for 
      medical text summarization. OBJECTIVE: Traditional approaches in ATS for 
      biomedical text suffer from fundamental issues such as an inability to capture 
      clinical context, quality of evidence, and purpose-driven selection of passages 
      for the summary. We aimed to circumvent these limitations through achieving 
      precise, succinct, and coherent information extraction from credible published 
      biomedical resources, and to construct a simplified summary containing the most 
      informative content that can offer a review particular to clinical needs. 
      METHODS: In our proposed approach, we introduce a novel framework, termed 
      Biomed-Summarizer, that provides quality-aware Patient/Problem, Intervention, 
      Comparison, and Outcome (PICO)-based intelligent and context-enabled 
      summarization of biomedical text. Biomed-Summarizer integrates the prognosis 
      quality recognition model with a clinical context-aware model to locate text 
      sequences in the body of a biomedical article for use in the final summary. 
      First, we developed a deep neural network binary classifier for quality 
      recognition to acquire scientifically sound studies and filter out others. 
      Second, we developed a bidirectional long-short term memory recurrent neural 
      network as a clinical context-aware classifier, which was trained on semantically 
      enriched features generated using a word-embedding tokenizer for identification 
      of meaningful sentences representing PICO text sequences. Third, we calculated 
      the similarity between query and PICO text sequences using Jaccard similarity 
      with semantic enrichments, where the semantic enrichments are obtained using 
      medical ontologies. Last, we generated a representative summary from the 
      high-scoring PICO sequences aggregated by study type, publication credibility, 
      and freshness score. RESULTS: Evaluation of the prognosis quality recognition 
      model using a large dataset of biomedical literature related to intracranial 
      aneurysm showed an accuracy of 95.41% (2562/2686) in terms of recognizing quality 
      articles. The clinical context-aware multiclass classifier outperformed the 
      traditional machine-learning algorithms, including support vector machine, 
      gradient boosted tree, linear regression, K-nearest neighbor, and naive Bayes, by 
      achieving 93% (16127/17341) accuracy for classifying five categories: aim, 
      population, intervention, results, and outcome. The semantic similarity algorithm 
      achieved a significant Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.61 (0-1 scale) on a 
      well-known BIOSSES dataset (with 100 pair sentences) after semantic enrichment, 
      representing an improvement of 8.9% over baseline Jaccard similarity. Finally, we 
      found a highly positive correlation among the evaluations performed by three 
      domain experts concerning different metrics, suggesting that the automated 
      summarization is satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS: By employing the proposed method 
      Biomed-Summarizer, high accuracy in ATS was achieved, enabling seamless curation 
      of research evidence from the biomedical literature to use for clinical 
      decision-making.

      Control Agent of the Asian Citrus Psyllid Diaphorina citri Kuwayama.

AB  - The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) Diaphorina citri Kuwayama is an economically 
      important pest of citrus because it vectors the causal pathogens of huanglongbing 
      (HLB) or citrus greening disease. Biological control is an important component of 
      citrus pest management but requires consistent strengthening of its impact on 
      pest complex. The brown lacewing Sympherobius barberi Banks is a known predator 
      of several insect pests from Asia, Europe, and America. However, there is not 
      much information about its effectiveness against D. citri. We evaluated S. 
      barberi against the D. citri and frozen eggs of the Mediterranean flour moth 
      Ephestia kuehniella, the latter is a common diet used for rearing predators in 
      laboratories. Adult S. barberi successfully fed on D. citri eggs and nymphs under 
      both light and dark conditions. Diaphorina citri was also suitable for the 
      development and reproduction of S. barberi except for slightly prolonged larval 
      development compared with E. kuehniella diet. The egg hatch from the total number 
      of eggs laid on D. citri and E. kuehniella diets averaged 65% and 52%, 
      respectively. Females laid 64% eggs on dimpled white paper compared to 36% 
      combined on plain paper and leaves of citrus, orange jasmine, eggplant and 
      cantaloupe. Sympherobius barberi released at densities of 2-6 adults against eggs 
      and nymphs of D. citri on infested orange jasmine plants in the cages provided a 
      reduction of 43-81% in the number of provided eggs or nymphs. In the field tests 
      on D. citri infested citrus trees, reduction averaged 35% in five cohorts in 
      which developing colonies of 28-32 nymphs were provided to one S. barberi per 
      cage. Findings suggest the significant potential of S. barberi as a predator of 
      D. citri and to contribute to reducing huanglongbing.

TI  - Flood hazards, human displacement and food insecurity in rural riverine areas of 
      Punjab, Pakistan: policy implications.

AB  - Rural communities inhabited on riverbank areas are frequently facing the 
      ever-increasing psychological, social and economic distress due to negative 
      effects of riverbank erosion. This study focused to investigate the impact of 
      climate-based hazards particularly riverbank erosion on human displacement, food 
      security and livelihood of rural riverine households and how vulnerable 
      households act in response. The survey data of 398 households of erosion-prone 
      riverbank area were collected, and group discussions connecting household heads 
      from this area were also used for this study. In human displacement scenario of 
      the last ten years due to riverbank erosion, almost 60% households lost their 
      homestead once while 38% more than three times and forced to displaced. Empirical 
      estimates of households' food security status indicated the value of Food 
      Security Index 2.11, highlighting households face issue of food security all over 
      the year. Food security issue of vulnerable households is highly related with 
      migration because these households have insufficient employment chances, and 
      coupled with limited or no farming land, they are highly prone to migration. In 
      conclusion, this study estimated that riverbank erosion risk is a co-exist reason 
      of population displacement, increasing rural environmental vulnerability and 
      obstacles to psychological, cultural and socioeconomic development. Implications 
      of local-based proper policy interventions such as developing advance research 
      regarding infusion of agro-based technology packages for emerging Bait areas for 
      developing resilience, human capital development, credit access and institution 
      service are necessary for improving livelihood and food security of these 
      riverbank erosion households. State-based institutions and local community 
      mutually need to focus increasing forestry specifically in riverbank areas to 
      save fertile land from riverbank erosion and reducing environmental pollution. 
      Convalescing livelihood and food security for erosion riverbank households, more 
      employment opportunity needs to provided, investing more in training and 
      education programmes to promoting income-generating activities that subsequently 
      will develop livelihood and food security of households.

TI  - Influence of semi-arid environment on radiation use efficiency and other growth 
      attributes of lentil crop.
PG  - 13697-13711
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-11376-w [doi]
AB  - Solar radiation (SR) is essential for yield improvement in lentil, which is a 
      crop of marginal environments. Herein, experiments were conducted over 2 years 
      under a semi-arid environment to study the radiation interception (RI), 
      efficiency, growth, and development of three lentil genotypes (Punjab Masoor-2009 
      (PM-2009), NIAB Masoor-2006 (NM-2006), and NIAB Masoor-2002 (NM-2002)) in 
      relation to three nitrogen rates (13, 19, and 25 kg ha(-1)). Seasonal dynamics of 
      intercepted photoactive radiation (IPAR) and cumulated photosynthetic photon flux 
      density were highly associated with seasonal dynamics of leaf area index (LAI), 
      with a high value of R(2) (0.93 and 0.89) across all nitrogen rates and genotypes 
      in both years. Nitrogen application promoted growth, and maximum LAI (3.97 and 
      3.57) and RI (324 and 301 MJ m(-2)) were attained for the first and second years 
      of study, respectively. Biomass and yield were positively associated with IPAR. 
      Variation in radiation absorption (RA) among genotypes was due to different 
      patterns of LAI development. In both years, yield (23% and 25%) and radiation use 
      efficiency (RUE) for grain yield (0.44 and 0.37 g MJ(-1)) were respectively 
      higher for PM-2009 than for the other genotypes. Genotype PM-2009 had 15 days 
      shorter crop cycle than others while 14% higher GDDs accumulated in the first 
      year compared with the second due to the higher temperature. High nitrogen 
      (25 kg ha(-1)) application resulted in higher dry matter (DM), and grain yield 
      (GY), while RUE and PAR were not statistically different under 19 kg N ha(-1) 
      application across years. Genotypes PM-2009 and NM-2006 may perform reasonably 
      well under arid to semi-arid regions at farmer field. These findings may assist 
      researchers and crop modelers to optimize the lentil ideotype for efficient light 
      utilization.

AB  - This study was carried out to determine the impact of one-year posttransplant 
      serum creatinine (SCr) levels on the long-term outcomes of living-related donor 
      kidney transplants. A retrospective cohort study included 773 adult 
      living-related renal transplant recipients from 2010 to 2012, with a minimum 
      follow-up period of five years. Demographics and posttransplantation follow-up 
      data including immunosuppression regimens, rejection episodes, and survival rates 
      were evaluated. Patients were divided into four cohorts (G1, G2, G3, and G4 based 
      on SCr at the end of the 1(st) year: G1, SCr <88.4 mu mol/L; G2, 88.5</= SCr </= 132.6 
      mumol/L; G3, 132.7</= SCr </=176.8 mol/L; and G4, SCr >/=176.9 mu mol/L). Comparisons 
      between the groups used the Chi-square test for qualitative parameters and 
      analysis of variance for continuous variables. Five-year graft survival for G1 
      was 98% as compared to 76% in G4 (P <0.001). Recipients of G4 encountered more 
      acute rejection episodes in 21% of the cases as compared to 7.3% in G1 (P = 
      0.001). Donors were older in G4 (42.07 +/- 10.4 years) as compared to G1 (30.1 +/- 
      8.5 years) (P = 0.001). A third of the donors in G1 were HLA identical as 
      compared to 7% in G4. Prediction of long-term graft survival is possible by the 
      SCr level at one year post transplant. This can be of great importance, 
      especially to identify those patients who require close monitoring in follow-up. 
      Donor age, HLA, and acute rejection impact SCr at one year and hence graft 
      outcome.

AB  - To evaluate the cytotoxic potential of metal-based chemotherapeutic candidate 
      towards the colorectal cancer, we have synthesized a new copper(II) complex 
      [Cu(qmbn)(q)(Cl)] (1) (where, qmbn = 2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)(methyl)benzonitrile and 
      q = 8-hydroxyquinoline) and structurally characterized by single crystal X-ray, 
      Powder-XRD, FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The structural analysis 
      reveals that copper(II) ions exist in a distorted square pyramidal (tau = ~0.1), 
      with ligation of a chloride ion, oxygen atom and two nitrogen atoms at equatorial 
      position and one oxygen atom at apical position. The cytotoxicity potential of 
      complex 1 was executed against human colorectal cell lines (HCT116), which showed 
      that 1 induces mitochondrion-mediated apoptotic cell death via activation of the 
      Bax (pro-apoptotic protein) caspases-3 and 9 proteins. Interestingly, complex 1 
      was found to be a good candidate as electron-transfer catalyst which mimics 
      catacholase with high turnover frequency (k(cat) = 1.03 x 10(2) h(-1)) for the 
      conversion of the model substrate 3,5-di-tertbutylcatechol (3,5-DTBC) to 
      3,5-di-tertbutylquinone (3,5-DTBQ). Furthermore, molecular docking studies 
      revealed that complex 1 was successfully localized inside the binding pocket of 
      protein kinase (Akt), which validate the mechanism and mode of interaction of 1 
      that displayed cytotoxic activity experimentally. The obtained outcomes reveal 
      that the complex 1 could be utilized as an encouraging perspective in the 
      development of new therapeutic candidate for colon cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interaction between metals is known from earlier studies, in which 
      one metal influences the absorption and functional role of other. Lead is known 
      to cause debilitating effects in living organisms and also prevents several 
      essential trace metals from functioning normally. METHODS: The relevant 
      literature using the key words lead toxicity, lead zinc interaction, zinc 
      nutrition and the ability of zinc to act against lead has been reviewed. RESULTS: 
      Role of several nutrients in reducing the manifestations of toxic metals have 
      been elucidated recently. Lead damages bio-membranes, causes cognitive 
      disabilities and disturbs the normal process of DNA replication and 
      transcription. Zinc on the other hand helps in proper maintenance of the cellular 
      membranes and plays an important role as a metal cofactor in most of the proteins 
      vital for membrane integrity. Zinc has essential role in cognitive functioning, 
      zinc finger proteins and significantly neutralizes most toxic effects of lead. 
      CONCLUSION: Increased lead exposure and limited resources for tackling lead 
      poisoning may cause an increased possibility of future environmental emergencies. 
      Interactions between essential nutrient metals and non-essential toxic metals may 
      act as important factor which can be used to target the metal toxicities. An 
      assumption is made that the lead toxicity can be reduced by maintaining the 
      status of essential trace metals like zinc.

TI  - Clinical Triaging in Cough Clinic Alleviates COVID-19 Overload in Emergency 
      Department in India.

LID - 10.1007/s42399-020-00705-2 [doi]
AB  - The importance of this study is the efficacy of "symptoms only" approach at a 
      screening clinic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis in low- and 
      middle-income countries (LMIC) setting. The objective of this study was to assess 
      how efficiently primary care physicians at the screening clinic were able to 
      predict whether a patient had COVID-19 or not, based on their symptom-based 
      assessment alone. The current study is a cross-sectional retrospective 
      observational study. This study was conducted at a single-center, tertiary care 
      setting with a dedicated COVID-19 facility in a metropolitan city in eastern 
      India. Participants are all suspected COVID-19 patients who presented themselves 
      to this center during the outbreak from 1 August 2020 to 30 August 2020. Patients 
      were referred to the Cough Clinic from the various outpatient departments of the 
      hospital or from smaller satellite centers located in different parts of the city 
      and other dependent geographical areas. The main outcome(s) and measure(s) is to 
      study whether outcome of confirmatory test results can be predicted accurately by 
      history taking alone. From 01 August 2020 to 30 Aug 2020, 511 patients with at 
      least one symptom suggestive of COVID-19 reported to screening clinic. Out of 
      these, 65.4% were males and 34.6% were females. Median age was 45 years with 
      range being 01 to 92 years. Fever was seen in 70.4% while cough was present in 
      22% of cases. Overall positivity for SARS-CoV-2 during this period in this group 
      was 54.21%. At 50% pre-test probability, the sensitivity of trained doctors 
      working at the clinic, in predicting positive cases based on symptoms alone, was 
      approximately 74.7%, and specificity for the same was 58.12%. The positive 
      predictive value of the doctors' assessment was 67.87%, and the negative 
      predictive value was 66.02%. Rapid triaging for confirmatory diagnosis of 
      COVID-19 is feasible at screening clinic based on history taking alone by 
      training of primary care physicians. This is particularly relevant in LMIC with 
      scarce healthcare resources to overcome COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Synergistic and concentration-dependent toxicity of multiple heavy metals 
      compared with single heavy metals in Conocarpus lancifolius.
PG  - 23258-23272
LID - 10.1007/s11356-020-12271-0 [doi]
AB  - While heavy metals (HMs) naturally occur in soil, anthropogenic activities can 
      increase the level of these toxic elements. Conocarpus lancifolius Engl. 
      (Combretaceae) was investigated as a potential phytoremediator of soils 
      contaminated with HM containing crude oil. This study assessed the potential of 
      C. lancifolius (CL), a locally available plant species in Kuwait, for resolving 
      local issues of the HM-contaminated soils. The absorption, accumulation, and 
      distribution of three toxic HMs (Cd, Ni, and Pb) and essential metals (Fe, Mg, 
      and metalloid Se) were examined, and their role in plant toxicity and tolerance 
      was evaluated. Conocarpus lancifolius plants were exposed to two different 
      concentrations of single and mixed HMs for 30 days. The accumulation of HMs was 
      determined in the roots, leaves, stems, and the soil using ICP/MS. Biomass, soil 
      pH, proline and protein content, and bioaccumulation, extraction, and 
      translocation factors were measured. The bioaccumulation, extraction, and 
      transcription factors were all >1, indicating CC is a hyperaccumulator of HM. The 
      HM accumulation in CL was concentration-dependent and depended on whether the 
      plants were exposed to individual or mixed HMs. The C.C leaves, stems, and roots 
      showed a significant accumulation of antioxidant constituents, such as proline, 
      protein, Fe, Mg, and Se. There was an insignificant increase in the soil pH, and 
      a decrease in plant biomass and a significant increase in protein, and 
      osmoprotective-proline as a result of the interaction of mixed heavy metals that 
      are more toxic than single heavy metals. This study indicates that C. lancifolius 
      is a good candidate for phytoremediation of multiple HM-contaminated soils. 
      Further studies to establish the phyto-physiological effect of multiple heavy 
      metals are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the pregnancy outcome of human immunodeficiency 
      syndrome-positive mothers. METHODS: The prospective observational study was 
      conducted at the Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Aziz Bhatti Shaheed 
      Teaching Hospital, Gujrat, Pakistan, from June 2011 to March 2018, and comprised 
      pregnant women screened positive for human immunodeficiency syndrome. Risk 
      factors and perinatal outcomes were noted on a predesigned proforma. Data was 
      analysed using SPSS 20. RESULTS: Of the 74 subjects with a mean age of 29+/-5.27 
      years, 63(85.1%) were multiparous and 11(14.9%) were nulliparous. Major risk 
      factors included unsterilized nasal or ear piercing in 70(94.6%) subjects, 
      history of blood transfusion 57(77%) and history of dental procedure in 
      unsterilized settings 23(31.1%). Spouses of 43(58.1%) subjects were positive for 
      human immunodeficiency syndrome, 22(29.7%) were negative and 9(12.2%) had unknown 
      status in this regard. In terms of outcome, 12(16.3%) subjects had spontaneous 
      abortion, 11(12.2%) had intrauterine death of foetus, 6(8.1%) had preterm 
      delivery and 45(60.8%) reached full term and were delivered. There were 2(2.6%) 
      patients with stage 4 disease who died during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Human 
      immunodeficiency syndrome infection in pregnant women was found to be associated 
      with poor pregnancy outcome.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis led a group of scientific and informatics experts to 
      accelerate development of an infrastructure for electronic data exchange for the 
      identification, processing, and reporting of scientific findings. The Fast 
      Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR(R)) standard which is overcoming the 
      interoperability problems in health information exchange was extended to 
      evidence-based medicine (EBM) knowledge with the EBMonFHIR project. A 13-step 
      Code System Development Protocol was created in September 2020 to support global 
      development of terminologies for exchange of scientific evidence. For Step 1, we 
      assembled expert working groups with 55 people from 26 countries by October 2020. 
      For Step 2, we identified 23 commonly used tools and systems for which the first 
      version of code systems will be developed. For Step 3, a total of 368 
      non-redundant concepts were drafted to become display terms for four code systems 
      (Statistic Type, Statistic Model, Study Design, Risk of Bias). Steps 4 through 13 
      will guide ongoing development and maintenance of these terminologies for 
      scientific exchange. When completed, the code systems will facilitate 
      identifying, processing, and reporting research results and the reliability of 
      those results. More efficient and detailed scientific communication will reduce 
      cost and burden and improve health outcomes, quality of life, and patient, 
      caregiver, and healthcare professional satisfaction. We hope the achievements 
      reached thus far will outlive COVID-19 and provide an infrastructure to make 
      science computable for future generations. Anyone may join the effort at

TI  - Hybrid QconCAT-Based Targeted Absolute and Data-Independent Acquisition-Based 
      Label-Free Quantification Enables In-Depth Proteomic Characterization of Wheat 
      Amylase/Trypsin Inhibitor Extracts.
PG  - 1544-1557
LID - 10.1021/acs.jproteome.0c00752 [doi]
AB  - Wheat amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) have gained significant relevance as 
      inducers of intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation. In this study, we 
      present a novel hybrid data-independent acquisition (DIA) liquid 
      chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach, combining QconCAT technology 
      with short microflow LC gradients and DIA and apply the method toward the 
      quantitative proteome analysis of ATI extracts. The presented method is fast, 
      robust, and reproducible and provides precise QconCAT-based absolute 
      quantification of major ATI proteins while simultaneously quantifying the 
      proteome by label-free quantification (LFQ). We analyzed extracts of 60 varieties 
      of common wheat grown in replication and evaluated the reproducibility and 
      precision of the workflow for the quantification of ATIs. Applying the method to 
      analyze different wheat species (i.e., common wheat, spelt, durum wheat, emmer, 
      and einkorn) and comparing the results to published data, we validated 
      inter-laboratory and cross-methodology reproducibility of ATI quantification, 
      which is essential in the context of large-scale breeding projects. Additionally, 
      we applied our workflow to assess environmental effects on ATI expression, 
      analyzing ATI content and proteome of same varieties grown at different 
      locations. Finally, we explored the potential of combining QconCAT-based absolute 
      quantification with DIA-based LFQ proteome analysis for the generation of new 
      hypotheses or assay development.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance profile in relation to virulence genes fimH, hlyA and usp 
      of uropathogenic E. coli isolates in Lahore, Pakistan.
PG  - 559-568
AB  - Uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) is the major etiological agent of urinary tract 
      infections. The objectives of this study were to evaluate E. coli isolates from 
      these patients for the phenotypic pattern of antibiotic resistance and to detect 
      the genes responsible for virulence namely fimH, hlyA and usp. A total of 110 E. 
      coli isolates were studied and 30 antibiotics were applied for susceptibility 
      testing. PCR detection of the genes fimH, hlyA and usp was done followed by 
      sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that the isolates were 
      highly resistant to cephalaxin (100%) and cephradine (100%) but displayed high 
      sensitivity to amikacin (96.27%), Imipenem (92.63%) and Meropenem (92.63%). The 
      prevalence of fimH, hlyA and usp was 86%, 83% and 16%, respectively. The 
      sequencing showed 99% similarity with previously reported sequences in NCBI 
      GenBank database. The co-existence of multiple drug-resistant bodies and virulent 
      genes has important implications for the treatment of patients with urinary tract 
      infection. This study provides information about treating drug-resistant E. coli 
      and the relationship of virulent genes with phenotypic resistance patterns.

TI  - Pharyngeal Pouch Surgery in Octo- and Nonagenarians is Safe and Effective: A 
      Multicentre Comparative Cohort Study.
PG  - 1819-1827
LID - 10.1007/s00268-021-05999-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgery is the only effective treatment strategy for a symptomatic 
      pharyngeal pouch. However, octo- and nonagenarians are often denied referral to a 
      surgeon because of perceived increased risks. Here, we compare the outcomes of 
      pharyngeal pouch surgery in octo- and nonagenarians with patients under 
      80 years-of-age and determine the factors which predict post-operative 
      complications and improvement in swallowing. METHODS: Analysis of a prospectively 
      maintained database of patients who underwent pharyngeal pouch surgery across 
      seven hospitals over 15 years. RESULTS: In total, 113 patients (>/=80 years-of-age: 
      27, <80 years-of-age: 86) underwent endoscopic or open pharyngeal pouch surgery. 
      Despite more comorbidities and a longer hospital stay (median: one extra day), 
      patients >/=80 years-of-age had comparable operative time, complication profile, 
      intensive care admission, emergency reoperation, and revisional pouch surgery as 
      their younger counterparts. Furthermore, the severity of complications was not 
      significantly different between the two age cohorts. No surgical mortality was 
      recorded. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diverticulectomy combined with 
      cricopharyngeal myotomy independently predicted higher rates of complications 
      (OR: 4.53, 95% CI: 1.43-14.33, p = 0.010), but also greater symptomatic 
      improvement (OR: 4.36, 95% CI: 1.50-12.67, p = 0.007). Importantly, a greater 
      proportion of octo- and nonagenarians experienced improved swallowing than 
      patients <80 years-of-age (96.3% vs. 74.4%, p = 0.013). Moreover, advanced age 
      was not predictive of post-operative complications on multivariate analysis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Pharyngeal pouch surgery in octo- and nonagenarians is safe and 
      effective. Surgical correction in this age group alleviates symptoms and improves 
      quality-of-life for most patients. These patients should not be denied surgery on 
      the basis of advanced age alone.

TI  - Characterization of 150 Wheat Cultivars by LC-MS-Based Label-Free Quantitative 
      Proteomics Unravels Possibilities to Design Wheat Better for Baking Quality and 
      Human Health.
LID - 10.3390/plants10030424 [doi]
LID - 424
AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. aestivum) contributes to 20% of the human protein 
      supply, delivers essential amino acids and is of fundamental importance for bread 
      and pasta quality. Wheat proteins are also involved in adverse human reactions 
      like celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA) and non-celiac wheat sensitivity 
      (NCWS). Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based label-free 
      quantitative (LFQ) proteomics of aqueous flour extracts, we determined 756 
      proteins across 150 wheat cultivars grown in three environments. However, only 
      303 proteins were stably expressed across all environments in at least one 
      cultivar and only 89 proteins thereof across all 150 cultivars. This underlines 
      the large influence of environmental conditions on the expression of many 
      proteins. Wheat cultivars varied largely in their protein profile, shown by high 
      coefficients of variation across different cultivars. Heritability (h(2)) ranged 
      from 0-1, with 114 proteins having h(2) > 0.6, including important proteins for 
      baking quality and human health. The expression of these 114 proteins should be 
      amenable to targeted manipulation across the wheat supply chain by varietal 
      choice and breeding for designing healthier wheat with better quality. Further 
      technical development is urgently required to assign functions to identifiable 
      proteins labeled yet uncharacterized in databases and speeding up detection 
      methods to routinely use proteomics in wheat supply chains.

AB  - The pandemic by COVID-19 is hampering everything on the earth including physical 
      and mental health, daily life and global economy. At the moment, there are no 
      defined drugs, while few vaccines are available in the market to combat 
      SARS-CoV-2. Several organic molecules were designed and tested against the virus 
      but they did not show promising activity. In this work we designed two copper 
      complexes from the ligands analogues with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. 
      Both the ligands and complexes were well characterized by using various 
      spectroscopic, thermal and X-ray diffraction techniques. Both the complexes as 
      well as ligands were screened through in silico method with the chloroquine and 
      hydroxychloroquine which essentially proved pivotal for successful understanding 
      towards the target protein and their mechanism of action. The results indicated 
      that the balanced hydrophobic and polar groups in the complexes favor their 
      binding in the active site of the viral ADP-ribose-1 monophosphatase enzyme over 
      the parent organic molecules.

TI  - A Novel Frameshift Mutation, Deletion of HBB:c.199_202delAAAG [Codon 66/67 
      (-AAAG)] in beta-Thalassemia Major Patients from the Western Region of Uttar 
      Pradesh, India.

AB  - PURPOSE: Beta thalassemia is one of the most common inherited disorders in India 
      with heterogenous clinical phenotypes from silent carrier to clinically severe 
      ones. Our study aimed to characterize the mutation spectrum in thalassemia 
      patients who are coming to the hospital for follow-up from the western region of 
      Uttar Pradesh India. PATIENTS AND METHODS: For the study, a case series of the 
      retrospective bi-centre study was conducted. The patients from two thalassemia 
      centers in the major hospitals (LLRMC Meerut, and JNMC, Aligarh administered by 
      the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)) in the Western Uttar Pradesh, 
      India were considered for the study. A total of 77 blood samples were obtained 
      from individuals (both related and unrelated) diagnosed with beta-thalassemia after 
      their consent. After DNA extraction, HBB gene amplification, mutation-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction and gene sequencing were carried out to analyze the 
      mutations. RESULTS: In this study, seven different types of mutations were 
      reported for the first time in Western Uttar Pradesh, India. A novel frameshift 
      mutation, deletion of 4 nucleotides Codon 66/67 (-AAAG) in exon 2 region, is 
      reported for the first time. IVS 1-5 (G>C) and Codon 41/42 (-CTTT) are the most 
      frequently reported mutations. The molecular spectrum for these two cases 
      consists of 44 and 42 alleles out of 108 alleles, respectively. CONCLUSION: A 
      total of 108 beta-thalassemia alleles were studied from 46 homozygous and 31 
      compound heterozygous patients. All the individuals were from 20 districts of the 
      Western Uttar Pradesh, India.

AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the 
      gastrointestinal system, known to be associated with increased risk of 
      carcinogenesis. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman, presenting with 
      symptoms of increased bowel frequency, per rectal bleeding and rectal pain with a 
      background of ulcerative colitis (UC). This was presumptively managed as UC 
      flare, with titration of her medications to control the symptoms. However, a 
      flexible sigmoidoscopy revealed an ulceroproliferative lesion in the rectum, 
      which was identified as an amelanotic anorectal malignant melanoma on 
      immunohistochemistry. No local or distant metastases were noted on radiological 
      imaging. The tumour enlarged progressively and was managed with laparotomy and 
      defunctioning stoma followed by palliative chemotherapy and immunotherapy. This 
      is the first such case reported in literature, highlighting the importance of 
      endoscopic assessment and the need to consider other differential diagnosis in 
      patients with symptoms of IBD flare.

TI  - Child Abuse and Neglect (Nursing).
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) defines child maltreatment as "all forms of 
      physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation 
      that results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, development or 
      dignity." There are four main types of abuse: neglect, physical abuse, 
      psychological abuse and sexual abuse. Abuse is defined as an act of commission 
      and neglect is defined as an act of omission in the care leading to potential or 
      actual harm. Neglect may include inadequate health care, education, supervision, 
      protection from hazards in the environment, and unmet basic needs such as 
      clothing and food. Neglect is the most common form of child abuse. Physical abuse 
      may include beating, shaking, burning, and biting. The threshold for defining 
      corporal punishment as abuse is unclear. Rib fractures are found to be the most 
      common finding associated with physical abuse. Psychological abuse includes 
      verbal abuse, humiliation, and acts that scare or terrorize a child, which may 
      result in future psychological illness of the child. Sexual abuse is defined as 
      "the involvement of dependent, developmentally immature children and adolescents 
      in sexual activities which they do not fully comprehend, to which they are unable 
      to give consent, or that violate the social taboos of family roles." Some cases 
      of sexual abuse do not need to involve oral, anal, or vaginal penetration and may 
      include exposure to sexually explicit materials, oral-genital contact, 
      genital-to-genital contact, genital-to-anal contact, and genital fondling. A 
      significant amount of child abuse cases frequently are missed by healthcare 
      providers. For the diagnosis of child abuse to be made, there needs to be a high 
      index of suspicion.[3]

LID - 2374
AB  - This article contains methods, results, and analysis agreed for the development 
      of an application based on the internet of things and making use of machine 
      learning techniques that serves as a support for the identification of the saline 
      wedge in the Magdalena River estuary, Colombia. As a result of this 
      investigation, the process of identifying the most suitable telecommunications 
      architecture to be installed in the estuary is shown, as well as the 
      characteristics of the software developed called SISME (Estuary Monitoring 
      System), and the results obtained after the implementation of prediction 
      techniques based on time series. This implementation supports the maritime 
      security of the port of Barranquilla since it can support decision-making related 
      to the estuary. This research is the result of the project "Implementation of a 
      Wireless System of Temperature, Conductivity and Pressure Sensors to support the 
      identification of the saline wedge and its impact on the maritime safety of the 
      Magdalena River estuary".

AB  - Aging is an unavoidable process, leading to cell senescence due to physiochemical 
      changes in an organism. Anti-aging remedies have always been of great interest 
      since ancient times. The purpose of anti-aging activities is to increase the life 
      span and the quality of life. Anti-aging activities are primarily involved in the 
      therapies of age-related disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), Alzheimer's 
      Disease (AD), cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary 
      diseases. These diseases are triggered by multiple factors that are involved in 
      numerous molecular pathways including telomere shortening, NF-kappaB pathway, 
      adiponectin receptor pathway, insulin, and IGF signaling pathway, AMPK, mTOR, and 
      mitochondria dysfunction. Natural products are known as effective molecules to 
      delay the aging process through influencing metabolic pathways and thus ensure an 
      extended lifespan. These natural compounds are being utilized in drug design and 
      development through computational and high throughput techniques for effective 
      pro-longevity drugs. A comprehensive study on natural compounds demonstrating 
      their anti-aging activities along with databases of natural products for drug 
      designing was executed and summarized in this review article.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Computerized clinical decision support (CDSS) -digital information 
      systems designed to improve clinical decision making by providers - is a 
      promising tool for improving quality of care. This study aims to understand the 
      uptake of ASMAN application (defined as completeness of electronic case sheets), 
      the role of CDSS in improving adherence to key clinical practices and delivery 
      outcomes. METHODS: We have conducted secondary analysis of program data 
      (government data) collected from 81 public facilities across four districts each 
      in two sates of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan. The data collected between August 
      -October 2017 (baseline) and the data collected between December 2019 - March 
      2020 (latest) was analysed. The data sources included: digitized labour room 
      registers, case sheets, referral and discharge summary forms, observation 
      checklist and complication format. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate and 
      interrupted time series regression analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The 
      completeness of electronic case sheets was low at postpartum period (40.5%), and 
      in facilities with more than 300 deliveries a month (20.9%). In multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis, the introduction of technology yielded significant 
      improvement in adherence to key clinical practices. We have observed reduction in 
      fresh still births rates and asphyxia, but these results were not statistically 
      significant in interrupted time series analysis. However, our analysis showed 
      that identification of maternal complications has increased over the period of 
      program implementation and at the same time referral outs decreased. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study indicates CDSS has a potential to improve quality of intrapartum care 
      and delivery outcome. Future studies with rigorous study design is required to 
      understand the impact of technology in improving quality of maternity care.

TI  - Slow-release nitrogen fertilizers enhance growth, yield, NUE in wheat crop and 
      reduce nitrogen losses under an arid environment.
PG  - 43528-43543

AB  - Higher demands of food led to higher nitrogen application to promote cropping 
      intensification and produce more which may have negative effects on the 
      environment and lead to pollution. While sustainable wheat production is under 
      threat due to low soil fertility and organic matter due to nutrient degradation 
      at high temperatures in the region. The current research explores the effects of 
      different types of coated urea fertilizers and their rates on wheat crop under 
      arid climatic conditions of Pakistan. Enhancing nitrogen use efficiency by using 
      eco-friendly coated urea products could benefit growers and reduce environmental 
      negative effects. A trial treatment included N rates (130, 117, 104, and 94 kg 
      ha(-1)) and coated urea sources (neem coated, sulfur coated, bioactive sulfur 
      coated) applied with equal quantity following split application method at sowing, 
      20 and 60 days after sowing (DAS). The research was arranged in a split-plot 
      design with randomized complete block design had three replicates. Data revealed 
      that bioactive sulfur coated urea with the application of 130 kg N ha(-1) 
      increased chlorophyll contents 55.0 (unit value), net leaf photosynthetic rate 
      (12.51 mumol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1)), and leaf area index (5.67) significantly. 
      Furthermore, research elucidates that bioactive sulfur urea with the same N 
      increased partial factor productivity (43.85 Kg grain Kg(-1) N supplied), 
      nitrogen harvest index (NHI) 64.70%, and partial nutrient balance (1.41 Kg grain 
      N content Kg(-1) N supplied). The neem-coated and sulfur-coated fertilizers also 
      showed better results than monotypic urea. The wheat growth and phenology 
      significantly improved by using coated fertilizers. The crop reached maturity 
      earlier with the application of bioactive sulfur-coated urea than others. Maximum 
      total dry matter 14402 (kg ha(-1)) recorded with 130 kg N ha(-1)application. 
      Higher 1000-grain weight (33.66 g), more number of grains per spike (53.67), 
      grain yield (4457 kg ha(-1)), and harvest index (34.29%) were obtained with 
      optimum N application 130 kg ha(-1) (recommended). There is a significant 
      correlation observed for growth, yield, and physiological parameters with N in 
      the soil while nitrogen-related indices are also positively correlated. The major 
      problem of groundwater contamination with nitrate leaching is also reduced by 
      using coated fertilizers. Minimum nitrate concentration (7.37 and 8.77 kg ha(-1)) 
      was observed with the application of bioactive sulfur-coated and sulfur-coated 
      urea with lower N (94 kg ha(-1)), respectively. The bioactive sulfur-coated urea 
      with the application of 130 kg N ha(-1) showed maximum phosphorus 5.45 mg kg(-1) 
      and potassium 100.67 mg kg(-1) in the soil. Maximum nitrogen uptake (88.20 kg 
      ha(-1)) is showed by bioactive sulfur coated urea with 130 kg N ha(-1) 
      application. The total available NPK concentrations in soil showed a significant 
      correlation with physiological attributes; grain yield; harvest index; and 
      nitrogen use efficiency components, i.e., partial factor productivity, partial 
      nutrient balance, and nitrogen harvest index. This research reveals that coating 
      urea with secondary nutrients, neem oil, and microbes are highly effective 
      techniques for enhancing fertilizer use efficiency and wheat production in 
      calcareous soils and reduced N losses under arid environments.

AB  - Evaluation of the effects of methanolic extract of Cucumis melo in ethylene 
      glycol-induced nephrolithiasis on Wistar rats. 0.75% solution of ethylene glycol 
      (EG) in payable water was given to produce nephrolithiasis on Wistar rats. The 
      action of oral intake of methanolic extract of Cucumis melo seed in 
      nephrolithiasis is studied and is matched with the action of oral intake of 
      Cystone (standard) on Wistar rats. EG resulted in hyperoxaluria and deposition of 
      calcium oxalate as well as raised urinary excretion of oxalate and calcium. 
      Supplementation with methanolic extract of Cucumis melo seed decreased the 
      increased renal oxalate, indicating a regulatory effect on oxalate formation 
      endogenously. The outcomes stipulate that the seed of Cucumis melo is endowed 
      with antinephrolithiatic action.

AB  - PURPOSE: Cardiac radioablation using stereotactic body radiation therapy is 
      gaining popularity as a noninvasive treatment for otherwise refractory 
      ventricular arrhythmias. As radiation oncologists might be unaccustomed to the 
      lexicon used by cardiologists to describe the location of arrhythmogenic foci, a 
      preliminary guide to cardiac-specific anatomy and orientation is needed to foster 
      effective communication between the radiation oncologist and cardiology team. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: Electrocardiogram-gated and respiratory-gated computed 
      tomography imaging was acquired per institutional protocol. Additional relevant 
      imaging modalities are described. The American Heart Association 17-segment model 
      is described in detail because this framework is used frequently by cardiologists 
      to describe the location left ventricular abnormalities. RESULTS: A step-by-step 
      guide is provided for properly rotating the heart from standard orthogonal views 
      obtained during radiation simulation to the cardiac-specific orientation needed 
      to appreciate the 17-segment model. Once the proper configuration is achieved, 
      the location of each segment is defined in detail. CONCLUSIONS: This atlas serves 
      as an introduction to the relevant anatomy and principles, and it provides a 
      suggested approach to help delineate cardiac radioablation targets using the 
      established American Heart Association 17-segment model.

TI  - Elucidation of DNA binding interaction of new Cu(II)/Zn(II) complexes derived 
      from Schiff base and L-tryptophan amino acid: a multispectroscopic and molecular 
      docking approach.
PG  - 44039-44050

AB  - Herein, we describe the synthesis, structural elucidation, and DNA interaction of 
      newly synthesized Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes, i.e., 
      [Cu(SB)(L-trp)(H(2)O)(2)]NO(3) (1) and [Zn(SB)(L-trp)(H(2)O)(2)]NO(3) (2) (SB = 
      Schiff base obtained from the reaction between o-vanillin and 
      2-amino-2-methylpropane-1,3-diol; L-trp = L-tryptophan). From the analysis, a 
      six-coordinated environment around the Cu(II) or Zn(II) center is proposed. The 
      ability of the complexes to bind with calf thymus DNA was examined by optical 
      spectroscopy (UV-vis titrations and steady-state fluorescence emission) and 
      viscosity measurements. The vivid experimental results revealed that complexes 1 
      and 2 avidly bind to DNA through surface and groove binding modes, albeit with 
      dissimilar intrinsic binding constants (1.54 x 10(4) and 1.36 x 10(4) M(-1) for 1 
      and 2, respectively). Both complexes can displace ethidium bromide (EB) to some 
      extent from the intercalated EB-DNA system, resulting in fluorescence quenching. 
      Additional experiments such as [Fe(CN)(6)](4-)-induced quenching and thermal 
      melting confirmed the electrostatic and groove binding mode. Furthermore, 
      molecular docking studies verified that both complexes locate in the DNA minor 
      groove by surface binding and were stabilized through weak intermolecular forces. 
      The binding affinity of the lowest energy docked pose was found to be -5.37 
      kcal/mol for complex 1 and - 5.18 kcal/mol for complex 2. The present work is 
      expected to pave the way for the synthesis of DNA-targeting Cu(II)/Zn(II) metal 
      complexes for the development of chemotherapeutic agents.

LID - 10.1111/tbed.14134 [doi]
AB  - The presence of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e 
      sublineage within Pakistan was initially detected in two samples collected during 
      2019. Analysis of further serotype O FMDVs responsible for disease outbreaks in 
      2019-2020 in the country has now identified the spread of this sublineage to 10 
      districts within two separate provinces in North-Eastern and North-Western 
      Pakistan. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these viruses are closely related 
      to those circulating in Bhutan, Nepal and India. The VP1 coding sequences of 
      these viruses from Pakistan belong to three distinct clusters, which may indicate 
      multiple introductions of this virus sublineage, although the routes of 
      introduction are unknown. Vaccine matching studies against O1 Manisa, O 3039 and 
      O TUR/5/2009 support the suitability of existing vaccine strains to control 
      current field outbreaks, but further studies are warranted to monitor the spread 
      and evolution of the O/ME-SA/Ind-2001e sublineage in the region. (145 words).

TI  - Exploring potential of copper and silver nano particles to establish efficient 
      callogenesis and regeneration system for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).
PG  - 564-585
LID - 10.1080/21645698.2021.1917975 [doi]
AB  - In vitro recalcitrance of wheat to regeneration is the major bottleneck for its 
      improvement through callus-based genetic transformation. Nanotechnology is one of 
      the most dynamic areas of research, which can transform agriculture and 
      biotechnology to ensure food security on sustainable basis. Present study was 
      designed to investigate effects of CuSO(4), AgNO(3) and their nanoparticles on 
      tissue culture responses of mature embryo culture of wheat genotypes (AS-2002 and 
      Wafaq-2001). Initially, MS-based callus induction and regeneration medium were 
      optimized for both genotypes using various concentrations of auxin (2,4-D, IAA) 
      and cytokinins (BAP, kinetin). The genotypes differed for embryogenic callus 
      induction and regeneration potential. Genotype AS-2002 yielded maximum 
      embryogenic calli in response to 3.0 mg/l 2,4-D, whereas Wafaq-2001 offered the 
      highest embryogenic calli against 3.5 mg/l 2,4-D supplemented in the induction 
      medium. Genotype AS-2002 showed maximum regeneration (59.33%) in response to 
      regeneration protocol comprising 0.5 mg/l IAA, 0.3 mg/l BAP and 1.0 mg/l Kin, 
      while Wafaq-2001 performed best in response to 0.5 mg/l IAA, 0.3 mg/l BAP and 1.5 
      mg/l Kin with 55.33% regeneration efficiency. The same optimized basal induction 
      and regeneration medium for both genotypes were further used to study effects of 
      CuSO(4), AgNO(3) and their nano-particles employing independent experiments. The 
      optimized induction medium fortified with various concentrations of CuSO(4) or 
      CuNPs confirmed significant effects on frequency of embryogenic callus. Addition 
      of either 0.020 mg/l or 0.025 mg/l CuSO(4), or 0.015 mg/l CNPs showed comparable 
      results for embryogenic callus induction and were statistically at par with 
      embryogenic callus induction of 74.00%, 75.67% and 76.83%, respectively. 
      Significantly higher regeneration was achieved from MS-based regeneration medium 
      supplemented with 0.015 mg/l or 0.020 mg/l CuNPs than standard 0.025 mg/l 
      CuSO(4). In another study, the basal induction and regeneration medium were 
      fortified with AgNO(3) or AgNPs ranging from 1 to 7 mg/l along with basal 
      regeneration media devoid of AgNO(3) or AgNPs (control). The maximum embryogenic 
      calli were witnessed from medium fortified with 3.0 mg/l or 4.0 mg/l AgNPs 
      compared with control and rest of the treatments. The standardized regeneration 
      medium fortified with 5.0 mg/l AgNO(3) or 3.0 mg/l AgNPs showed pronounced effect 
      on regeneration of wheat genotypes and offered maximum regeneration compared with 
      control. The individual and combined effect of Cu and Ag nanoparticles along with 
      control (basal regeneration media of each genotype) was also tested. 
      Surprisingly, co-application of metallic NPs showed a significant increase in 
      embryogenic callus formation of genotypes. Induction medium supplemented with 
      0.015 mg/l CuNPs + 4.0 mg/l AgNPs or 0.020 mg/l CuNPs + 2.0 mg/l AgNPs showed 
      splendid results compared to control and other combination of Cu and Ag 
      nanoparticles. The maximum regeneration was achieved by co-application of 0.015 
      mg/l CuNP and 4.0 mg/l AgNPs with 21% increment of regeneration over control. It 
      is revealed that CuNPs and AgNPs are potential candidate to augment somatic 
      embryogenesis and regeneration of mature embryo explants of wheat.Abbreviations:

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of miR-146a and its target protein RhoA 
      expression levels in breast cancer. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted 
      at Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan, from March 2017 to 
      November 2018, and comprised confirmed breast cancer cases and controls who were 
      matched for age and ethnicity. Genotyping and expression profiling of archived 
      samples was performed. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 590 
      subjects, 295(50%) each were cases and controls. Among the cases, there were 
      195(66%) Punjabis, 59(20%) Pathans and 41(14%) Kashmiris. The corresponding 
      numbers among the controls were 198(67%), 58(19.7%) and 39(13.2%). The 
      association between genotypes of the cases and controls was significant (p<0.05). 
      Strong association was seen in dominant, recessive and allelic models (p=0.05). 
      In Punjabi group the association was (p<0.00) significant, but this association 
      was not significant in Kashmiri and Pathan groups (p>0.05). No association was 
      found with the receptor status and miR-146a polymorphism. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      miR-146a gene polymorphism rs2910164 G/C was found to have increased 
      susceptibility to breast cancer at genotype and allelic levels.

TI  - Bioactive Apigenin loaded oral nano bilosomes: Formulation optimization to 
      preclinical assessment.
PG  - 269-279
LID - 10.1016/j.jsps.2021.02.003 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Diabetic (type-2) is a metabolic disease characterized by increased blood 
      glucose level from the normal level. In the present study, apigenin (AG) loaded 
      lipid vesicles (bilosomes: BIL) was prepared, optimized and evaluated for the 
      oral therapeutic efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL: AG-BIL was prepared by a thin-film 
      evaporation method using cholesterol, span 60 and sodium deoxycholate. The 
      prepared formulation was optimized by 3-factor and 3-level Box-Behnken design 
      using particle size, entrapment efficiency and drug release as a response. The 
      selected formulation further evaluated for ex-vivo permeation, in 
      vivo pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics study. RESULTS: The optimized AG 
      bilosomes (AG-BILopt) has shown the vesicle size 183.25 +/- 2.43 nm, entrapment 
      efficiency 81.67 +/- 4.87%. TEM image showed a spherical shape vesicle with sharp 
      boundaries. The drug release study revealed a significant enhancement in AG 
      release (79.45 +/- 4.18%) from AG-BILopt as compared to free AG-dispersion 
      (25.47 +/- 3.64%). The permeation and pharmacokinetic studies result revealed 4.49 
      times higher flux and 4.67 folds higher AUC(0-t) than free AG-dispersion. The 
      antidiabetic activity results showed significant (P < 0.05) enhancement in 
      therapeutic efficacy than free AG-dispersion. The results also showed marked 
      improvement in biochemical parameters. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested, the 
      prepared apigenin loaded bilosomes was found to be an efficient delivery in the 
      therapeutic efficacy in diabetes.

AB  - Preliminary investigations showed that preparations from Arabian Gulf catfish 
      (Arius bilineatus, Val) epidermal gel secretion (PCEGS) exhibit potent 
      anti-inflammatory and healing properties as shown in our previous clinical trials 
      for the healing of non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, chronic back pain, and some 
      other neurological disorders. Here, we report for the first time a unique 
      preparation containing only proteins and lipids (soluble protein fraction B, 
      SPF-FB), derived from the PCEGS accelerated the healing and recovery of 
      sensory-motor functions of experimental sciatic nerve crush injury in rats with 
      its unique neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties on the spinal neurons 
      and peripheral nerve fibers. Male rats were randomly assigned to five groups: (I) 
      NAIVE, (II) SHAM, (III) CRUSH treated with saline, (IV) CRUSH + SPF-FB treated 
      with 3 mg/kg intraperitoneally (IP) and (V) CRUSH + SPF-FB treated with 6 mg/kg 
      subcutaneously (SC) groups. The crush groups III, IV and V underwent sciatic 
      nerve crush injury, followed by treatment daily for 14 days with saline, SPF-FB 
      IP and SPF-FB SC. All animals were tested for the neurobehavioral parameters 
      throughout the 6 weeks of the study. Sciatic nerve and spinal cord tissues were 
      processed for light and electron histological examinations, stereological 
      analysis, immunohistochemical and biochemical examinations at Week 4 and Week 6 
      post-injury. Administration of SPF-FB IP or SC significantly enhanced the 
      neurobehavioral sensory and motor performance and histomorphological 
      neuroregeneration of the sciatic nerve-injured rats. The stereological evaluation 
      of the axon area, average axon perimeters, and myelin thickness revealed 
      significant histomorphological evidence of neuroregeneration in the FB-treated 
      sciatic nerve crush injured groups compared to controls at 4 and 6 weeks. SPF-FB 
      treatment significantly prevented the increased in NeuN-immunoreactive neurons, 
      increased GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes, and decreased GAP-43. We conclude that 
      SPF-FB treatment lessens neurobehavioral deficits, enhances axonal regeneration 
      following nerve injury. We conclude that SPF-FB treatment lessens neurobehavioral 
      deficits and enhances axonal regeneration following nerve injury, as well as 
      protects spinal neurons and enhances subcellular recovery by increasing 
      astrocytic activity and decreasing GAP-43 expression.

      Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic by the World 
      Health Organization, the disease has gained momentum with every passing day. 
      Various private and government sectors of different countries allocated funding 
      for research in multiple capacities. A significant portion of efforts has been 
      devoted to information technology and service infrastructure development, 
      including research on developing intelligent models and techniques for alerts, 
      monitoring, early diagnosis, prevention, and other relevant services. As a 
      result, many information resources have been created globally and are available 
      for use. However, a defined structure to organize these resources into categories 
      based on the nature and origin of the data is lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aims 
      to organize COVID-19 information resources into a well-defined structure to 
      facilitate the easy identification of a resource, tracking information workflows, 
      and to provide a guide for a contextual dashboard design and development. 
      METHODS: A sequence of action research was performed that involved a review of 
      COVID-19 efforts and initiatives on a global scale during the year 2020. Data 
      were collected according to the defined structure of primary, secondary, and 
      tertiary categories. Various techniques for descriptive statistical analysis were 
      employed to gain insights into the data to help develop a conceptual framework to 
      organize resources and track interactions between different resources. RESULTS: 
      Investigating diverse information at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels 
      enabled us to develop a conceptual framework for COVID-19-related efforts and 
      initiatives. The framework of resource categorization provides a gateway to 
      access global initiatives with enriched metadata, and assists users in tracking 
      the workflow of tertiary, secondary, and primary resources with relationships 
      between various fragments of information. The results demonstrated mapping 
      initiatives at the tertiary level to secondary level and then to the primary 
      level to reach firsthand data, research, and trials. CONCLUSIONS: Adopting the 
      proposed three-level structure allows for a consistent organization and 
      management of existing COVID-19 knowledge resources and provides a roadmap for 
      classifying future resources. This study is one of the earliest studies to 
      introduce an infrastructure for locating and placing the right information at the 
      right place. By implementing the proposed framework according to the stated 
      guidelines, this study allows for the development of applications such as 
      interactive dashboards to facilitate the contextual identification and tracking 
      of interdependent COVID-19 knowledge resources.

AB  - The genetic diversity of Leishmania spp. in North Eastern Pakistan remains 
      undetermined despite increased cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL). This study 
      was designed to decipher the molecular characterization and genetic diversity of 
      Leishmania spp. in North Eastern Pakistan. Out of 13761 CL suspected cases, 567 
      cases were microscopically positive and confirmed as Leishmania spp. by internal 
      transcribed spacer (ITS) gene amplification through the PCR- RFLP technique. 
      Further, isolates were directly sequenced to conduct phylogenetic analysis for 
      genetic diversity. Among suspected CL cases, Mirpur showed the highest proportion 
      of CL infection with 4.85% (118/2431) of the cases, while the Neelum district 
      showed the lowest percentage at 3.29% (9/273). The slide positivity rate, annual 
      blood examination rate, and annual parasite incidence rate were 3.84, 0.27, and 
      0.01% respectively, and the incidence of CL in the age group 1-20 years old was 
      higher in males (50.92%) than females (25.75%). The RFLP analysis and sequencing 
      confirmed the occurrence of Leishmania tropica, Leishmania major, and Leishmania 
      infantum. Leishmania tropica (p = 0.02) confirmed significantly higher 
      nucleotides variation than L. major (p = 0.05). Current findings confirmed the 
      prior assumption that anthroponotic CL is the primary CL form present in North 
      Eastern Pakistan. Moreover, this is the first report based on molecular 
      identification of L. major, and L. infantum from North Eastern Pakistan. This 
      remarkable heterogeneity in the Leishmania spp. is the leading cause of treatment 
      failure and emergence of new haplotypes. Therefore more extensive investigations 
      are recommended from all geographical regions of North Eastern Pakistan, 
      especially those using a large sample size.

TI  - Acoustofluidic Separation of Proteins Using Aptamer-Functionalized 
      Microparticles.
PG  - 8309-8317
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.1c01198 [doi]
AB  - We propose an acoustofluidic method for the triseparation of proteins conjugated 
      with aptamer-coated microparticles inside a microchannel. Traveling surface 
      acoustic waves (TSAWs) produced from a slanted-finger interdigital transducer 
      (SFIT) are used to separate the protein-loaded microparticles of different sizes 
      via the TSAW-driven acoustic radiation force (ARF). The acoustofluidic device 
      consists of an SFIT deposited onto a piezoelectric lithium niobate substrate and 
      a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic channel on top of the substrate. The 
      TSAWs propagating on the substrate penetrate into the sample fluid flow, where 
      the human protein-conjugated microparticles are suspended, inside the PDMS 
      microchannel. The microparticles are subjected to the TSAW-driven ARF with 
      varying magnitude depending on their size and thus flow along different 
      streamlines, leading to triseparation of the proteins. In this work, we used two 
      different-sized streptavidin-functionalized polystyrene (PS) microparticles to 
      capture two kinds of aptamers (apt15 and aptD17.4), which were labeled with a 
      respective biotin molecule at one end. The biotin ends of the aptamers were 
      attached to the microparticles through streptavidin-biotin linkage, whereas the 
      free ends of the aptamers were used to capture their target proteins of thrombin 
      (th) and immunoglobulin E (IgE). The resultant PS-apt15-th and PS-aptD17.4-IgE 
      complexes, as well as mCardinal2, were used for experimental demonstration of 
      acoustofluidic triseparation of the human proteins. We achieved simultaneous 
      separation of proteins of three kinds (th, IgE, and mCardinal2) for the first 
      time via the TSAW-driven ARF in the proposed acoustofluidic device.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To find the association between interleukin-1 receptor-associated 
      kinase 1 rs3027898 gene polymorphism and preeclampsia. METHODS: The case-control 
      study was conducted from October, 2018 to September, 2019 at the Railway General 
      Hospital and the Department of Biochemistry, Islamic International Medical 
      College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised patients diagnosed with preeclampsia 
      and healthy controls. The interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 polymorphism 
      was determined using multiplex tetra primer amplification refractory mutation 
      system polymerase chain reaction. Outcomes were determined in terms of 
      association of interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 with preeclampsia. Data 
      was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 160 subjects, 80(50% were cases with 
      a mean age of 30+/-5.3 years and 80(50%) were controls with a mean age of 27+/-3.7 
      years. AC genotype was seen in 45(56.25%) cases and 30(37.5%) controls, AA 
      genotype in 25(31.25%) cases and 30(37.5%) controls, while CC genotype was seen 
      in 10(12.5%) cases and 20(25%) controls (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was no 
      significant association of interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 genotypes 
      with preeclampsia.

      patients.
PG  - 733-739

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to determine the relationship of 374T/A (rs1800624) polymorphism in 
      the gene encoding RAGE with Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), diabetic retinopathy 
      (DR) and serum soluble RAGE (sRAGE) level in Pakistani patients. METHODS: A 
      case-control study, conducted from January 2017 to December 2018, involving 150 
      healthy controls (HC), 150 T2DM patients with no retinopathy (DNR) and 150 DR 
      patients diagnosed by coloured fundus photography. Tetra-primer amplification 
      refractory mutation system - polymerase chain reaction (T-ARMS-PCR) was used for 
      genotyping. Serum sRAGE levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assays (ELIZA). RESULTS: The frequency of TT, TA and AA genotypes of rs1800624 
      polymorphism were: 92.7%, 6%, 1.3% in HC, 80%, 17.3%, 2.7% in DNR and 76.7%, 
      19.3%, 4.3% in DR groups. Heterozygous TA genotype and mutant A allele showed 
      significant association with diabetes and DR vs HC. In dominant model, mutant 
      allele showed significant association with DNR and DR vs HC. No significant 
      association of rs1800624 was detected with DR and its sub-groups, 
      non-proliferative DR (NPDR) and proliferative DR (PDR) vs DNR. Dividing NPDR into 
      mild, moderate and severe, heterozygous TA genotype showed significant 
      association with moderate and severe NPDR vs DNR. In DNR and DR groups, TA 
      genotype was significantly associated with raised sRAGE. CONCLUSION: rs1800624 
      RAGE gene polymorphism might be a risk factor for T2DM and NPDR in Pakistani 
      patients. Raised sRAGE levels have a positive correlation with PDR and are 
      associated with heterozygosity of rs1800624 polymorphism in DNR and DR groups.

AB  - Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is one of the most frequent auditory deficits 
      in humans characterized by high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Very few 
      studies have reported the relationship between OTOF (Locus: DFNB9) and hereditary 
      hearing loss in India. We aimed to decipher the genetic cause of prelingual NSHL 
      in a large affected Muslim consanguineous families using whole-exome sequencing 
      (WES). The study was performed following the guidelines and regulations of the 
      Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), New Delhi. The population was 
      identified from Jammu and Kashmir, the Northernmost part of India. Near about 100 
      individuals were born deaf-mute in the village of 3,000 inhabitants. A total of 
      103 individuals (with 52 cases and 51 controls) agreed to participate in this 
      study. Our study revealed a rare non-sense homozygous mutation 
      NC_000002.11:g.2:26702224G>A; NM_001287489.2:c.2122C>T; 
      NP_001274418.1:p.(Arg708( *)) in the 18th exon of the OTOF gene. Our study 
      provides the first insight into this homozygous condition, which has not been 
      previously reported in ExAC, 1,000 Genome and genomAD databases. Furthermore, the 
      variant was confirmed in the population cohort (n = 103) using Sanger sequencing. 
      In addition to the pathogenic OTOF variant, the WES data also revealed novel and 
      recurrent mutations in CDH23, GJB2, MYO15A, OTOG, and SLC26A4 genes. The rare 
      pathogenic and the novel variants observed in this study have been submitted to 
      the ClinVar database and are publicly available online with the accessions 
      SCV001448680.1, SCV001448682.1 and SCV001448681.1. We conclude that OTOF-related 
      NSHL hearing loss is prevalent in the region due to successive inbreeding in its 
      generations. We recommend premarital genetic testing and genetic counseling 
      strategies to minimize and control the disease risk in future generations.

LID - 10.1093/molbev/msab172 [doi]
AB  - Livestock farming across the world is constantly threatened by the evolutionary 
      turnover of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) strains in endemic systems, the 
      underlying dynamics of which remain to be elucidated. Here, we map the 
      eco-evolutionary landscape of cocirculating FMDV lineages within an important 
      endemic virus pool encompassing Western, Central, and parts of Southern Asia, 
      reconstructing the evolutionary history and spatial dynamics over the last 
      20 years that shape the current epidemiological situation. We demonstrate that 
      new FMDV variants periodically emerge from Southern Asia, precipitating waves of 
      virus incursions that systematically travel in a westerly direction. We evidence 
      how metapopulation dynamics drive the emergence and extinction of spatially 
      structured virus populations, and how transmission in different host species 
      regulates the evolutionary space of virus serotypes. Our work provides the first 
      integrative framework that defines coevolutionary signatures of FMDV in regional 
      contexts to help understand the complex interplay between virus phenotypes, host 
      characteristics, and key epidemiological determinants of transmission that drive 
      FMDV evolution in endemic settings.

AB  - The 6-shogaol, is a flavanone type flavonoid that is abundant in citrus fruit and 
      has a wide range of pharmacological effects. The present study attempted to 
      evaluate the antiurolithic effect of 6-shogaol on ethylene glycol (EG) and 
      ammonium chloride (AC)-induced experimental urolithiasis in rats. The efficacy of 
      6-shogaol 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg was studied in EG 0.75% (V/V) and AC 1% (W/V) 
      experimentally induced urolithiasis in rats for 21 days. The weight difference, 
      urine volume, the levels of calcium, phosphate, magnesium, oxalate and uric acid 
      in urine was observed. The blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid in serum 
      and levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) were also measured. 
      Histopathological analyses in kidneys were also performed. The rats weights were 
      higher in the 6-shogaol groups than the urolithiasis group. EG caused a 
      significant increase in serum creatinine (p < 0.05), BUN (P < 0.001), and uric 
      acid (p < 0.01) while treatment with Cystone (750 mg/kg), and 6-shogaol (50 and 
      100 mg/kg) showed the significant reduction in increased serum levels of 
      creatinine (p < 0.001), uric acid (p < 0.01) and BUN (p < 0.001). Administration 
      of EG and AC showed statistically significant (p < 0.001) elevated levels of MDA 
      and reduction in GSH levels. Treatment of Cystone (750 mg/kg), and 6-shogaol (50 
      and 100 mg/kg) significantly (p < 0.001) reduced MDA levels and an increase GSH 
      levels as compared to EG and AC-treated group. The histological findings further 
      attested antiurolithiatic properties of 6-shogaol. The present study attributed 
      clinical shreds of evidence first time that claiming the significant 
      antiurolithic effect of 6-shogaol and could be a cost-effective candidate for the 
      prevention and treatment of urolithiasis.

TI  - Association analysis of -429T/C receptor for advanced glycation end products 
      (RAGE) gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetic retinopathy and serum soluble RAGE 
      levels in Pakistani patients.
PG  - 1175-1180

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of receptor for advanced glycation end 
      products gene polymorphism 429T/C (rs1800625) with diabetic retinopathy and serum 
      soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products levels in patients with type 
      2 diabetes. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted from January 2017 to 
      December 2018 at Pakistan Railway Hospital, Rawalpindi, and the Multidisciplinary 
      Laboratories of Islamic International Medical College, Riphah International 
      University (RIU), Islamabad, Pakistan. Those included were healthy controls in 
      group A, diabetics without retinopathy in group B and patients having diabetic 
      retinopathy in group C. Genotyping for 429T/C was done by tetra-primer 
      amplification refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction. Serum soluble 
      receptor for advanced glycation end products levels were measured using 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of 
      the 450 subjects, 150(33.3%) were in each of the three groups. The frequency of 
      TT, TC and CC genotypes of 429T/C polymorphism were 137(91.3%), 10(6.7%) and 
      3(2%) in group A; 133(88.6%), 13(8.7%) and 4(2.7%) in group B; and 127(84.7%), 
      18(12%) and 5(3.3%) in group C. No significant association of 429T/C genotypic 
      and allelic frequencies were found with groups B and C (p>0.05). Serum soluble 
      receptor for advanced glycation end products levels were significantly high in 
      patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and were positively correlated 
      with fasting plasma glucose in group C (p<0.05). TC and CC genotypes were 
      significantly associated with raised serum soluble receptor for advanced 
      glycation end products, and TC with raised fasting plasma glucose in group C. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The 429T/C receptor for advanced glycation end products gene 
      polymorphism was found to be associated with severe non-proliferative diabetic 
      retinopathy, and serum soluble receptor for advanced glycation end products 
      levels had a positive correlation with severity of diabetic retinopathy.

      associated with nephrotic syndrome.

AB  - Nephrotic syndrome arising from monogenic mutations differs substantially from 
      acquired ones in their clinical prognosis, progression, and disease management. 
      Several pathogenic mutations in the COQ8B gene are known to cause nephrotic 
      syndrome. Here, we used the whole-exome sequencing (WES) technology to decipher 
      the genetic cause of nephrotic syndrome (CKD stage-V) in a large affected 
      consanguineous family. Our study exposed a novel missense homozygous mutation 
      NC_000019.9:g.41209497C > T; NM_024876.4:c.748G > A; NP_079152.3:p.(Asp250Asn) in 
      the 9th exon of the COQ8B gene, co-segregated well with the disease phenotype. 
      Our study provides the first insight into this homozygous condition, which has 
      not been previously reported in 1000Genome, ClinVar, ExAC, and genomAD databases. 
      In addition to the pathogenic COQ8B variant, the WES data also revealed some 
      novel and recurrent mutations in the GLA, NUP107, COQ2, COQ6, COQ7 and COQ9 
      genes. The novel variants observed in this study have been submitted to the 
      ClinVar database and are publicly available online with the accessions: 
      SCV001451361.1, SCV001451725.1 and SCV001451724.1. Based on the patient's 
      clinical history and genomic data with in silico validation, we conclude that 
      pathogenic mutation in the COQ8B gene was causing kidney failure in an autosomal 
      recessive manner. We recommend WES technology for genetic testing in such a 
      consanguineous family to not only prevent the future generation, but early 
      detection can help in disease management and therapeutic interventions.

AB  - High resistance to antimicrobials is associated with biofilm formation 
      responsible for infectious microbes to withstand severe conditions. Therefore, 
      new alternatives are necessary as biofilm inhibitors to control infections. In 
      this study, the antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of Fagonia indica 
      extracts were evaluated against MDR clinical isolates. The extract exhibited its 
      antibiofilm effect by altering adherence and disintegration of bacterial cell 
      wall. Fagonia indica has antibacterial effect as minimum inhibitory concentration 
      (MIC) values ranging from 125 to 500 microg mL-1 and minimum bactericidal 
      concentration (MBC) value was 500-3000 microg mL-1 against multidrug resistant (MDR) 
      clinical isolates. The extract exhibited its antibiofilm effect by altering 
      adherence and disintegration of bacterial cell wall. Fagonia indica had 
      antibacterial effect as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging 
      from 125 to 500 microg mL-1 and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) value was 
      500-3000 microg mL-1 against MDR isolates. The maximum inhibitory effects of Fagonia 
      indica chloroform extract on biofilm formation was observed on Staphylococcus 
      aureus (71.84%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (70.83%) after 48 hrs showing 
      that inhibition is also time dependent. Our results about bacterial cell protein 
      leakage indicated that MDR isolates treated with chloroform extract of Fagonia 
      indica showed maximum protein leakage of K. pneumoniae (59.14 microg mL-1) followed 
      by S. aureus (56.7 microg mL-1). Cell attachment assays indicated that chloroform 
      extract resulted in a 43.5-53.5% inhibition of cell adherence to a polystyrene 
      surface. Our results revealed that extracts of Fagonia indica significantly 
      inhibited biofilm formation among MDR clinical isolates, therefore, could be 
      applied as antimicrobial agents and cost effective biofilm inhibitor against 
      these MDR isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cereal products like flour and bread are known to trigger 
      diseases such as wheat allergy, celiac disease and non-celiac wheat sensitivity 
      (NCWS). Some of these diseases are caused by allergenic proteins, the expression 
      of which might vary depending on the grain type and manufacturing processes. 
      Therefore, we examined the protein composition and abundance of potentially 
      allergenic proteins in flours from bread wheat, spelt and rye, and corresponding 
      breads. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Nano-LC-ESI-MS/MS and label free 
      quantification (LFQ) we analyzed the proteome of six different bread flours 
      (wholegrain and superfine flours from rye, spelt and bread wheat) and 14 bread 
      types (yeast and sourdough fermented breads from all flours and wheat breads 
      plus/minus bread improver). Potentially allergenic proteins in flours and breads 
      were functionally categorized using the Pfam database and relatively quantified 
      by LFQ. RESULTS: We could show that almost equal numbers of proteins can be 
      identified in rye- and spelt samples compared to wheat samples using the Uniprot 
      bread wheat protein database, indicating high sequence conservation between 
      cereals. In total, 4424 proteins were identified in the 20 flour and bread 
      samples. The average number of identified proteins in flour (2719 +/- 243) was 
      slightly higher than in bread (2283 +/- 232; P < 0.001). In wheat- and spelt 
      wholegrain flour higher protein numbers (wheat: 2891 +/- 90; spelt: 2743 +/- 140) 
      were identified on average than in superfine flour (wheat: 2562 +/- 79; P = 0.009; 
      spelt: 2431 +/- 140; P = 0.004). Neither the absolute number nor the abundance 
      distribution of potentially allergenic proteins were dependent on the flour type 
      or the fermentation process, but known allergenic proteins like gliadins showed 
      higher relative abundance in spelt- and wheat samples, compared to rye samples. 
      CONCLUSION: We provide comprehensive proteome data for six flour types and 
      related breads showing that the grain species have greater influence on proteome 
      composition than milling and fermentation processes. Our data indicate that 
      allergenic proteins are not selectively degraded during bread production and are 
      more abundant in bread wheat and spelt compared to rye. SIGNIFICANCE: Our 
      proteomics study revealed that bread contains a number of potentially and proven 
      allergenic proteins. Most likely allergenicity is not dependent on milling or 
      conventional fermentation processes, but on the grain type. Relative abundance of 
      allergenic proteins was higher in spelt- and wheat samples than in rye samples. 
      Considering rye bread as better suited to atopic individuals predisposed to react 
      to cereal allergens, clinical trials are warranted to verify this assumption.

AB  - The direct discharge of azo dyes and/or their metabolites into the environment 
      may exert toxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic effects on exposed fauna and flora. 
      In this study, we analyzed the metabolites produced during the degradation of an 
      azo dye namely Reactive Black 5 (RB5) in the bacterial-augmented floating 
      treatment wetlands (FTWs), followed by the investigation of their underlying 
      toxicity. To this end, a FTWs system was developed by using a common wetland 
      plant Phragmites australis in the presence of three dye-degrading bacteria 
      (Acinetobacter junii strain NT-15, Pseudomonas indoloxydans strain NT-38, and 
      Rhodococcus sp. strain NT-39). We found that the FTW system effectively degraded 
      RB5 into at least 20 different metabolites with the successful removal of color 
      (95.5%) from the water. The fish toxicity assay revealed the nontoxic 
      characteristics of the metabolites produced after dye degradation. Our study 
      suggests that bacterially aided FTWs could be a suitable option for the 
      successful degradation of azo dyes, and the results presented in this study may 
      help improve the overall textile effluent cleanup processes.

TI  - Capecitabine-Associated Loss of Fingerprints: A Case Report of a 62-Year-Old Man 
      With Colorectal Cancer Suffering From Capecitabine-Induced Adermatoglyphia.
PG  - e15519
LID - 10.7759/cureus.15519 [doi]
LID - e15519
AB  - BACKGROUND:  Capecitabine is a prodrug of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and is converted 
      to 5-FU in tumor tissue. Its primary mechanism of action is the suppression of 
      DNA synthesis via inhibition of thymidylate synthetase. It is mostly used for 
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, 
      metastatic breast, and localized and metastatic gastric cancer, among others. 
      Adverse effects of capecitabine include diarrhea, hand-foot syndrome (HFS), 
      pancytopenia, stomatitis, increased bilirubin, nausea, vomiting, and very rarely 
      adermatoglyphia. Dermatoglyphics refers to fingerprints. Adermatoglyphia refers 
      to the loss of fingerprints. Case review summary: We report the case of a 
      62-year-old male patient known case of locally advanced colorectal cancer. He 
      presented in the clinic with residual disease after initially being treated with 
      local surgery and chemoradiation with 5-FU. Positron emission tomography (PET) 
      scan done at the time of presentation showed locally advanced disease. He was 
      managed with surgery followed by chemotherapy with oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2) and 
      capecitabine (Xeloda) 1500 mg twice a day for two weeks via three weekly cycles. 
      Post cycle five, the patient complained of grade I HFS symptoms and inability to 
      open a bank account due to loss of fingerprints. The patient was oblivious about 
      this condition before that. After completing his adjuvant treatment that is six 
      cycles of oxaliplatin and Xeloda, his symptoms of the HFS and loss of 
      fingerprints, improved. CONCLUSION: As this case describes, adermatoglypia is a 
      rare but noticeably side effect of capecitabine with a high chance of 
      reversibility. Similar case reports have been reported with some normalization of 
      fingerprints, after stopping treatment. Fingerprints have been used for centuries 
      as means of identification in banks, aviation, immigration, computers, and mobile 
      phones, amongst others. Awareness regarding the loss of fingerprints due to 
      capecitabine is important for the patient and clinician, and alternative means of 
      identification or other adaptive methods of recognition should be used for these 
      patients.

BTI - StatPearls
AB  - According to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), drugs, 
      substances, and certain chemicals used in drug manufacturing are classified into 
      5 categories or schedules depending on the drug's acceptable medical use and 
      potential for abuse or dependency. The Controlled Substance Act (CSA) outlines 
      the criteria for scheduling a substance, which includes: Potential for abuse 
      (actual or relative). Scientific evidence of pharmacological effects. Current 
      scientific knowledge regarding the drug or other substance. History and patterns 
      of abuse. Scope, duration, and significance of abuse. Risks to public health. 
      Liability for psychic or physiological dependence. Whether the substance is an 
      immediate precursor to a controlled substance. Controlled substances include all 
      opioid analgesics, sedatives, hypnotics, and stimulants. In the United States, 
      federal regulation restricts when and how these substances may be prescribed 
      to prevent misuse and abuse. In 2020, 91,799 drug overdose deaths were reported 
      in the United States, with opioids involved in 68,630 deaths-approximately 75% of 
      all drug overdose deaths involved opioids. Synthetic opioids were associated with 
      82.3% of opioid-related deaths.[CDC. Overdose Prevention] The age-adjusted 
      overdose death rate increased by 31% from 2019 to 2020.[CDC. CDC Wonder]  
      Opioids continue to be a significant public health crisis. In 2021, 80,411 lives 
      were lost to opioid overdose.[NIH. Drug Overdose Deaths: Facts and Figures] By 
      2022, out of the 107,081 reported drug overdose deaths in the United States, 68% 
      of these deaths were caused by synthetic opioids, particularly illegally 
      manufactured fentanyl.[CDC. Illicitly Manufactured Fentanyl-Involved Overdose 
      Deaths with Detected Xylazine - United States, January 2019-June 2022] The 
      prevalence of opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose has increased across the 
      country. According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
      Administration (SAMHSA), in 2020, approximately 2.7 million individuals aged 12 
      or older had opioid use disorder in the United States, including 2.3 million 
      individuals with a prescription opioid use disorder.[SAMHSA. The National Survey 
      on Drug Use and Health: 2020] In response to these staggering statistics, 
      clinical prescribers, dispensers, and manufacturers play a crucial role 
      in reducing opioid distribution and ensuring the proper disposal of unused 
      medications. Prescribers are encouraged to proactively prescribe opioid reversal 
      agents to individuals receiving prescribed opioids and those at risk for opioid 
      use disorder. Prescribers must also adhere strictly to federally mandated 
      clinical guidelines for responsible prescribing of controlled substances and 
      opioids. Finally, healthcare professionals must also prevent prescription 
      violations by adhering to best practices for opioid prescribing and monitoring. 
      These measures are essential to combat the opioid crisis and the 
      rising prevalence of substance use disorders in the United States. Prescription 
      opioids have emerged as a gateway to substance use disorders, contributing to the 
      ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. Studies indicate that leftover or 
      unconsumed opioid medications-originally prescribed for legitimate medical 
      use-are often misused, particularly among vulnerable adolescents. This concerning 
      trend exacerbates the crisis, amplifying its impact on individuals and 
      communities nationwide. Despite their risks, prescription opioids are 
      essential in managing acute and chronic pain. More than one-fourth of the United 
      States population experiences chronic pain, with annual healthcare costs 
      exceeding 100 billion dollars due to pain management and opioid dependence. These 
      costs surpass the combined expenses of cancer, diabetes mellitus, and heart 
      disease. Given the profound impact of chronic pain on a patient's quality of 
      life, prescribers must adopt best practices to ensure responsible opioid use. 
      The consequences of pain management decisions are far-reaching, underscoring the 
      need for a thoughtful, evidence-based approach to opioid prescribing. Appropriate 
      opioid prescribing encompasses a comprehensive approach that involves regular 
      assessment, treatment planning, and ongoing monitoring. The goal is to provide 
      adequate pain relief while minimizing the risks of addiction, abuse, overdose, 
      diversion, and misuse. Clinicians must understand that inappropriate opioid 
      prescribing, including under-prescribing, overprescribing, or continuing to 
      prescribe opioids when they are no longer effective, can have serious 
      consequences, particularly in patients with chronic pain. Patients with chronic 
      pain face additional challenges, as prolonged opioid use can lead to tolerance, 
      dependence, and significant psychological, behavioral, and emotional problems, 
      including anxiety and depression. Inadequate or excessive prescribing can 
      exacerbate these complications. Healthcare Provider Knowledge Deficit Current 
      evidence shows substantial knowledge gaps regarding appropriate and inappropriate 
      prescribing of controlled substances, highlighting deficiencies in understanding 
      recent research, legislation, and best prescribing practices. A practice gap 
      persists between recommended best practices for preventing prescription drug 
      abuse and current clinical practice.  Healthcare providers may lack an 
      understanding of addiction pathophysiology, at-risk populations, and 
      the distinctions between prescription and nonprescription opioid addiction. A 
      common misconception equates addiction with dependence, underscoring the need to 
      clarify this distinction. The outdated belief that opioid addiction is purely 
      psychological must be reframed. In reality, it is a complex condition involving 
      both psychological and physiological factors, often intertwined with 
      chronic pain disorders. Despite efforts to incorporate education on substance use 
      disorders in medical school curricula, a pervasive practice gap remains in 
      appropriately managing these conditions and implementing responsible prescribing 
      practices for controlled substances. Bridging this gap is essential for improving 
      patient outcomes and mitigating the opioid crisis. Definitions Clinicians 
      should be familiar with key terms associated with addiction and substance use 
      disorders, as they are frequently used in medical literature. Clear definitions 
      help establish diagnostic criteria, enabling providers to identify individuals 
      needing treatment. : Addiction: According to the American Society of Addiction 
      Medicine (ASAM), addiction is a treatable, chronic medical disease involving 
      complex interactions among brain circuits, genetics, the environment, and an 
      individual's life experiences.[ASAM. Glossary of Addiction] Individuals with 
      addiction engage in behaviors that become compulsive and are continued despite 
      adverse consequences. However, the ASAM emphasizes that prevention and treatment 
      strategies for addiction are as successful as those for other chronic diseases. 
      ASAM identifies 5 characteristics of addiction: Craving for drug or positive 
      reward. Dysfunctional emotional response. Failure to recognize significant 
      problems affecting behavior and relationships. Inability to consistently abstain. 
      Impairment in control of behavior: Substance use disorder: The Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR), 
      eliminates the previous categorization of substance-related addictions into abuse 
      and dependence. The DSM-5-TR combines these terms into substance use disorders, 
      categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on severity, providing greater 
      diagnostic clarity for clinicians and patients. Abuse: Use of an illegal 
      substance or maladaptive pattern of substance use for a nonmedical purpose other 
      than pain relief, such as altering one's state of consciousness. 
      Dependence: Physiological reliance on a drug resulting in a withdrawal syndrome 
      with cessation or reduction in the amount of drug administered. 
      Diversion: Transferring a controlled substance from an authorized person's use to 
      an unauthorized person's use for distribution or possession. Misuse: Use of a 
      medication in a manner different than how it was prescribed. 
      Pseudoaddiction: Pursuit of additional medication due to poor pain control, with 
      the cessation of drug-seeking behavior upon achievement of appropriate pain 
      control. Tolerance: The lessened effect of a substance after being exposed to 
      that substance or the need to escalate doses to achieve the same result.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a class of medications 
      utilized for the treatment of diabetes mellitus by mechanisms promoting incretin 
      release and insulin production. Although poorly understood, cases of acute 
      pancreatitis have been observed in patients taking GLP-1 RAs. Sodium-glucose 
      co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is) are another class of diabetic medications 
      inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption which have been associated with rare cases 
      of euglycemic ketoacidosis. Acute pancreatitis itself has been an observable 
      cause of diabetic ketoacidosis, although typically in a hyperglycemia state. In 
      this case report, we present a patient on SGLT-2is and GLP-1 RAs who developed 
      acute pancreatitis, which may have precipitated euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis 
      (eu-DKA).

AB  - Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer 
      related death in western countries. The successful treatment of PDAC remains 
      limited. We investigated the effect of Fraction B, which is a fraction purified 
      from catfish (Arius bilineatus, Val.) skin secretions containing proteins and 
      lipids, on PDAC biology both in-vivo and in-vitro. We report here that Fraction B 
      potently suppressed the proliferation of both human and mouse pancreatic cancer 
      cells in vitro and significantly reduced the growth of their relevant xenograft 
      (Panc02) and orthotopic tumors (human Panc-1 cells) (p < 0.05). The Reverse Phase 
      Protein Array (RPPA) data obtained from the tumor tissues derived from orthotopic 
      tumor bearing mice treated with Fraction B showed that Fraction B altered the 
      cancer stem cells related pathways and regulated glucose and glutamine 
      metabolism. The down-regulation of the cancer stem cell marker CD44 expression 
      was further confirmed in Panc-1 cells. CBC and blood chemistry analyses showed no 
      systemic toxicity in Fraction B treated Panc-1 tumor bearing mice compared to 
      that of control group. Our data support that Fraction B is a potential candidate 
      for PDAC treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The educational efficacy in neonatal resuscitation relies on the 
      subject and teaching strategies. Therefore, it is imperative to test diverse 
      educational methods if they are more instructive to engage students in active 
      learning and practicing knowledge. Hence, the present study aims to investigate 
      the efficacy of a pedagogical framework in neonatal resuscitation skill learning 
      among nursing students in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: A single-blind 
      randomized controlled trial was conducted between October 2020 to March 2021. 
      Sixty nursing students in the 3rd and 4th year of professional training were 
      randomly allocated to the pedagogy and the traditional group. The pedagogy group 
      learned via 6-step LSPPDM (Learn, See, Practice, Prove, Do, Maintain) pedagogy 
      including lectures, video, clinical observation, skill sessions under 
      supervision, and self-directed practice. The traditional group learned through 
      2-step (Learn, Practice) method that included lectures and skill sessions under 
      supervision. The outcomes measured included technical and non-technical skills in 
      neonatal resuscitation. The technical skill deals with steps such as stimulation, 
      ventilation, oxygenation, intubation, chest compression, medications, and 
      reporting. Non-technical skills refer to teamwork skills that focus on the 
      interaction between leader and helper. Both skills were measured through 
      previously published validated tools two times before and after the intervention 
      by blinded assessors in a simulated delivery room. RESULTS: Overall, the skill 
      was significantly improved in both groups after intervention. Yet, the results 
      showed that the mean difference of technical skill score in the pedagogy group 
      (24.3 +/- 3.5) was significantly higher (p <  0.001) compared to the traditional 
      group (16.2 +/- 2.4). Likewise, the mean difference of non-technical skill score in 
      the pedagogy (36.9 +/- 1.9) was highly significant (p <  0.001) compared to the 
      traditional group (31.2 +/- 1.7). CONCLUSIONS: The LSPPDM pedagogy was found more 
      effective in enhancing technical and non-technical skills in neonatal 
      resuscitation compared to the traditional method. The results of this study 
      support the efficacy of the 6-step LSPPDM pedagogy in the education of nursing 
      students regarding neonatal resuscitation in a resource-limited setting. TRIAL 
      REGISTRATION: Prospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT04748341 ).

AB  - Water scarcity is a major threat to agriculture and humans due to over 
      abstraction of groundwater, rapid urbanization and improper use in industrial 
      processes. Industrial consumption of water is lower than the abstraction rate, 
      which ultimately produces large amounts of wastewater such as from tannery 
      industry containing high concentration of chromium (Cr). Chromium-contaminated 
      tannery industry wastewater is used for irrigation of food crops, resulting in 
      food safety and public health issues globally. In contrast to conventional 
      treatment technologies, constructed wetlands (CWs) are considered as an 
      eco-friendly technique to treat various types of wastewaters, although their 
      application and potential have not been discussed and elaborated for Cr treatment 
      of tannery wastewater. This review briefly describes Cr occurrence, distribution 
      and speciation in aquatic ecosystems. The significance of wetland plant species, 
      microorganisms, various bedding media and adsorbents have been discussed with a 
      particular emphasis on the removal and detoxification of Cr in CWs. Also, the 
      efficiency of various types of CWs is elaborated for advancing our understanding 
      on Cr removal efficiency and Cr partitioning in various compartments of the CWs. 
      The review covers important aspects to use CWs for treatment of Cr-rich tannery 
      wastewater that are key to meet UN's Sustainable Development Goals.

AB  - Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a priority disease of livestock in Pakistan, 
      which was classified in stage 2 of the Progressive Control Pathway (PCP-FMD) in 
      2015, aiming to reduce disease impact. Further progression requires efforts to 
      reduce viral circulation that may ultimately result in being awarded official 
      disease-free status by the World Organisation for Animal Health [Office 
      International des Epizooties (OIE)]. Typically, FMD control is reliant on the 
      extensive use of vaccines, requiring careful consideration of the costs and 
      benefits to ensure investment is likely to provide a positive return. This study 
      conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) for a proposed zone within Punjab 
      Province, Pakistan. Benefits were assumed to come from averted production losses 
      and treatment costs and the costs based on typical measures required for 
      establishing a disease-free zone. To estimate the impact of FMD at the farm 
      level, models were created to estimate effects on milk production, offtakes, and 
      changes in herd value over a 5-year period with different parameters used to 
      represent the production systems present. Control strategy costs incorporated 
      aspects of vaccination, surveillance, sanitary measures, program management, 
      stakeholder engagement, preparatory studies, training, and capacity building. The 
      results indicated a median benefit-cost ratio of 1.03 (90% central range 0.37, 
      1.63) with a median net present value of 1.99 billion Pakistan Rupees (90% 
      central range -37.7, 37.0). The greatest cost was due to vaccination at 56%, 
      followed by sanitary measures (including implementing and maintaining an animal 
      ID system and quarantine stations around the zone) at 41%. Although the median 
      benefit-cost ratio and net present value indicated that investment is likely to 
      generate a positive return, the large variation indicates caution in interpreting 
      the results and it is possible that an increase in animal value through new 
      export markets will be required. Further refinement in our knowledge of disease 
      impact and the details of the control strategy are needed. Moreover, there are 
      implications regarding vaccine security, since the strategy is reliant on the 
      steady provision of quality vaccines in order to achieve the anticipated 
      benefits, raising important issues on vaccine availability for countries to 
      maintain lucrative export markets for FMD.

TI  - Glutamate Dehydrogenase (GdhA) of Streptococcus pneumoniae Is Required for High 
      Temperature Adaptation.

AB  - During its progression from the nasopharynx to other sterile and nonsterile 
      niches of its human host, Streptococcus pneumoniae must cope with changes in 
      temperature. We hypothesized that the temperature adaptation is an important 
      facet of pneumococcal survival in the host. Here, we evaluated the effect of 
      temperature on pneumococcus and studied the role of glutamate dehydrogenase 
      (GdhA) in thermal adaptation associated with virulence and survival. Microarray 
      analysis revealed a significant transcriptional response to changes in 
      temperature, affecting the expression of 252 genes in total at 34 degrees C and 40 degrees C 
      relative to at 37 degrees C. One of the differentially regulated genes was gdhA, which is 
      upregulated at 40 degrees C and downregulated at 34 degrees C relative to 37 degrees C. Deletion of gdhA 
      attenuated the growth, cell size, biofilm formation, pH survival, and 
      biosynthesis of proteins associated with virulence in a temperature-dependent 
      manner. Moreover, deletion of gdhA stimulated formate production irrespective of 
      temperature fluctuation. Finally, DeltagdhA grown at 40 degrees C was less virulent than 
      other temperatures or the wild type at the same temperature in a Galleria 
      mellonella infection model, suggesting that GdhA is required for pneumococcal 
      virulence at elevated temperature.

TI  - Flood hazards and livelihood vulnerability of flood-prone farm-dependent Bait 
      households in Punjab, Pakistan.
PG  - 11553-11573
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-16443-4 [doi]
AB  - Pakistan is one of the most climate change- and natural disaster-affected country 
      of the world where livelihood and lives of inhabitants are often affected due to 
      these disasters. In the scenario of various disasters and risks, flood disasters 
      are the most recurrent hazards that cause Bait households' livelihood to be more 
      vulnerable. Hence, this research work has focused to investigate livelihood 
      vulnerability of flood-prone Bait households in southern Punjab of Pakistan. This 
      study used multistage sampling technique for collection of the cross-sectional 
      data of 398 flood disasters vulnerable Bait household's respondents from three 
      high-risk flood-prone districts Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan. 
      Face-to-face interview procedure and well-developed pre-tested questionnaire were 
      used for data collection in this research work. This study applied vulnerability 
      framework of LVI-IPCC and LVI in the direction of comparing the level of 
      vulnerabilities in preferred three Bait district households. Empirical estimates 
      of LVI major components and framework of IPCC vulnerability have indicated Bait 
      households of Muzaffargarh more vulnerable owing to higher exposure and 
      sensitivity and lower adaptive capacity than other districts. In contrast to 
      other districts, Muzaffargarh households have investigated more vulnerable to 
      flood disasters more particularly in LVI sub-components such as health (0.460), 
      water (0.360), and food (0.515) access. These research findings will be helpful 
      to policymakers to work out and put into practice effectual programs and 
      strategies such as constructing more water reserves, developing overhead 
      infrastructure, easy access of institutional loans, and generating off-farm 
      income sources. These local-based feasible measures will be helpful for native 
      inhabitants to reduce frequency of floods in the direction of lessened 
      vulnerability and increased resilience via recovering generally the livelihood of 
      vulnerable Bait households in Punjab Pakistan and particularly the district 
      Muzaffargarh.

TI  - Assessment of morphological and molecular variability of some Solanum melongena 
      L. cultivars and wild Solanum incanum L. in Saudi Arabia.
PG  - 187-199
LID - 10.1007/s42977-020-00052-2 [doi]
AB  - The genus Solanum exhibits a wide range of variability in morphology, flavor, and 
      tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Phenotypic and genetic variability 
      using ISSR and RAPD markers of Solanum incanum distributed in Al-Baha province of 
      the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is assessed. Thirty samples are representing three 
      different locations: Baljershy, Aqeeq, and Tohama, besides twenty-five samples 
      representing five different commercial cultivars tested. Growth type, the number 
      of leaves per plant, fruit size (phenotypic traits), crude protein, 
      carbohydrates, digestive organic matter, and Mg, Ca, P were the principal 
      contributors in the PCA. Molecular analysis showed that 114 ISSR and 80 RAPD 
      alleles with a 100% polymorphism were recorded. The polymorphism information 
      content (PIC) values ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 for ISSR and from 0.59 to 0.89 for 
      RAPD data. Similarity values ranged from 0.16 to 1.00, with an average of 0.47 
      for ISSR and from 0.01 to 0.97, with an average of 0.36 for RAPD. It resulted in 
      a positive and significant correlation between morphological, molecular, 
      nutritional, and chemical analysis of fruits using Mantel analysis. UPGMA and PCA 
      for morphological traits and molecular data discriminated commercial cultivars 
      and wild relatives. Solanum incanum was more diverse than commercial varieties. 
      This study revealed a wide genetic diversity among and within collected eggplant 
      accessions and may use in breeding programs of eggplants. There is a need to 
      increase the present eggplant collection to widen the genetic diversity of 
      cultivated eggplant varieties in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - A homozygous ROR2 variant in a family with atypical Robinow syndrome and 
      tetramelic transverse deficiency of autopods.
PG  - 343-349
LID - 10.1002/ajmg.a.62514 [doi]
AB  - We present five members of a consanguineous Pakistani kinship with the most 
      severe familial tetramelic transverse autopod deficiency reported to date and 
      additionally having some of the common autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome-1 
      (RRS1) features including short stature, short neck, severe vertebral anomalies 
      of kyphoscoliosis, hemivertebrae, fusion of thoracic vertebrae, broad forehead, 
      and dental crowding. We mapped the locus of this atypical RRS and detected 
      homozygous 8-nucleotide deletion c.1353_1360del (p.(Met452Alafs*4)) in ROR2, the 
      gene responsible for RRS1. We did not find any other variant shared by all 
      affected individuals that could possibly act as a modifier of limb defect. 
      Autopods are affected in RRS1, but severe autopod deficiency is not a 
      characteristic feature. Over 30 biallelic variants dispersed throughout the gene 
      are known in ROR2-related RS, with no genotype-phenotype correlation for specific 
      RRS1 features. Considering together with the sporadic case homozygous for variant 
      p.(Arg442*) and the case homozygous for p.(Arg441Thrfs*16) in a family where 
      heterozygous members have brachydactyly type B1, we propose that homozygous 
      truncating variants that originate at residues 441-452 can cause severe autopod 
      reduction anomalies, suggesting some genotype-phenotype correlation for this 
      particular phenotype.

AB  - Compressed tablet formation from granular drug require binder with Cohesiveness 
      property. Plants mucilage as pharmaceutical excipients are available. In this 
      study, biocompatible date palm mucilage was encapsulated with silver nano 
      particles for sustained drug release to provoke an immune response. Nano 
      formulated mucilage was characterized by UV/VIS, FTIR, XRD, SEM/EDX 
      spectrophotometry. UV/VIS spectra revealed an intense surface plasmon resonance 
      peak at 406 nm for spherical mono dispersed silver nano formulated mucilage 
      resulted from efficient reduction of silver ions to AgNPs. Zeta sizer disclosed 
      the emergence of single peak at 139.7 nm with 100% intensity. Crude mucilage 
      exhibited number of peaks in the region of 4000-500 cm(-1) by FT-IR spectroscopy 
      whereas purified as well as nano formulated samples showed somewhat different 
      pattern of peaks in addition to peaks of crude sample. XRD spectra of crude 
      mucilage revealed somewhat regular pattern while purified and modified mucilage 
      displayed irregular structure. In SEM analysis, crude mucilage was appeared as 
      granular that turned into porous network with entangled tiny silver nano spheres. 
      A controlled release of drug levofloxacin hemihydrate was evaluated using crude/ 
      nano formulated mucilage as excipient. Nano formulated mucilage delayed the onset 
      exposure of drug in gastric medium giving recommendations as value added bio 
      binder for drug to the target organ.

TI  - Biochar and slow-releasing nitrogen fertilizers improved growth, nitrogen use, 
      yield, and fiber quality of cotton under arid climatic conditions.
PG  - 13742-13755
LID - 10.1007/s11356-021-16576-6 [doi]
AB  - The efficiency of nitrogenous fertilizers in South Asia is on a declining 
      trajectory due to increased losses. Biochar (BC) and slow-releasing nitrogen 
      fertilizers (SRNF) have been found to improve nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in 
      certain cases. However, field-scale studies to explore the potential of BC and 
      SRNF in south Asian arid climate are lacking. Here we conducted a field 
      experiment in the arid environment to demonstrate the response of BC and SRNF on 
      cotton growth and yield quality. The treatments were comprised of two factors, 
      (A) nitrogen sources, (i) simple urea, (ii)neem-coated urea, (iii)sulfur-coated 
      urea, (iv) bacterial coated urea, and cotton stalks biochar impregnated with 
      simple urea, and (B) nitrogen application rates, N(1)=160 kg ha(-1), N(2) = 120 
      kg ha(-1), and N(3) = 80 kg ha(-1). Different SRNF differentially affected cotton 
      growth, morphological and physiological attributes, and seed cotton yield (SCY). 
      The bacterial coated urea at the highest rate of N application (160 kg ha(-1)) 
      resulted in a higher net leaf photosynthetic rate (32.8 mumol m(-2) s(-1)), leaf 
      transpiration rate (8.10 mmol s(-1)), and stomatal conductance (0.502 mol m(-2) 
      s(-1)), while leaf area index (LAI), crop growth rate (CGR), and seed cotton 
      yield (4513 kg ha(-1)) were increased by bacterial coated urea at 120 kg ha(-1) 
      than simple urea. However, low rate N application (80 kg ha(-1)) of bacterial 
      coated urea showed higher nitrogen use efficiency (39.6 kg SCY kg(-1) N). The 
      fiber quality (fiber length, fiber strength, ginning outturn, fiber index, and 
      seed index) was also increased with the high N application rates than N2 and N3 
      application. To summarize, the bacterial coated urea with recommended N (160 kg 
      ha(-1)) and 75% of recommended N application (120 kg ha(-1)) may be recommended 
      for farmers in the arid climatic conditions of Punjab to enhance the seed cotton 
      yield, thereby reducing nitrogen losses.

      Diabetic Rats.
PG  - 26098-26107

AB  - Fustin is a prominent ingredient of Rhus verniciflua Stokes (Anacardiaceae) and 
      has a wide range of pharmacological and clinical effects. The present study 
      attempted to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of fustin in streptozotocin- and 
      high-fat diet-induced diabetes in rats. The efficacy of fustin 50 mg/kg and 100 
      mg/kg/day p.o. was studied in 60% of total calories from fat as a high-fat diet 
      along with single-dose administration streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) 
      experimentally induced diabetes in rats for 42 days. The mean body weight; blood 
      glucose; and biochemical parameters such as lipid profile, total protein (TP), 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), malondialdehyde 
      (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), insulin, leptin levels, adiponectin 
      levels, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) 
      activity in serum were measured. The rats' weight was maintained in the fustin 
      groups compared to the diabetic control group. Diabetes caused a significant 
      increase in serum levels in blood glucose, lipid profile, MDA, TNF-alpha, ALT, and 
      AST parameters and a decrease in serum insulin, adiponectin, leptin, GSH, SOD, 
      and CAT compared to healthy rats. The treatment regimen with fustin (50 and 100 
      mg/kg) significantly restored all serum parameters in test groups. The present 
      study found clinical evidence for the first time regarding the significant 
      antidiabetic property of fustin, which could be a worthwhile candidate for the 
      treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Susceptibility of Ocular Staphylococcus aureus to Antibiotics and Multipurpose 
      Disinfecting Solutions.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics10101203 [doi]
LID - 1203
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a frequent cause of ocular surface infections worldwide. 
      Of these surface infections, those involving the cornea (microbial keratitis) are 
      most sight-threatening. S. aureus can also cause conjunctivitis and contact 
      lens-related non-infectious corneal infiltrative events (niCIE). The aim of this 
      study was to determine the rates of resistance of S. aureus isolates to 
      antibiotics and disinfecting solutions from these different ocular surface 
      conditions. In total, 63 S. aureus strains from the USA and Australia were 
      evaluated; 14 were from niCIE, 26 from conjunctivitis, and 23 from microbial 
      keratitis (MK). The minimum inhibitory (MIC) and minimum bactericidal 
      concentrations (MBC) of all the strains to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, oxacillin, 
      gentamicin, vancomycin, chloramphenicol, azithromycin, and polymyxin B were 
      determined. The MIC and MBC of the niCIE strains to contact lens multipurpose 
      disinfectant solutions (MPDSs) was determined. All isolates were susceptible to 
      vancomycin (100%). The susceptibility to other antibiotics decreased in the 
      following order: gentamicin (98%), chloramphenicol (76%), oxacillin (74%), 
      ciprofloxacin (46%), ceftazidime (11%), azithromycin (8%), and polymyxin B (8%). 
      In total, 87% of all the isolates were multidrug resistant and 17% of the 
      isolates from microbial keratitis were extensively drug resistant. The microbial 
      keratitis strains from Australia were usually susceptible to ciprofloxacin (57% 
      vs. 11%; p = 0.04) and oxacillin (93% vs. 11%; p = 0.02) compared to microbial 
      keratitis isolates from the USA. Microbial keratitis isolates from the USA were 
      less susceptible (55%) to chloramphenicol compared to conjunctivitis strains 
      (95%; p = 0.01). Similarly, 75% of conjunctivitis strains from Australia were 
      susceptible to chloramphenicol compared to 14% of microbial keratitis strains (p 
      = 0.04). Most (93%) strains isolated from contact lens wearers were killed in 
      100% MPDS, except S. aureus 27. OPTI-FREE PureMoist was the most active MPDS 
      against all strains with 35% of strains having an MIC </= 11.36%. There was a 
      significant difference in susceptibility between OPTI-FREE PureMoist and Biotrue 
      (p = 0.02). S. aureus non-infectious CIE strains were more susceptible to 
      antibiotics than conjunctivitis strains and conjunctivitis strains were more 
      susceptible than microbial keratitis strains. Microbial keratitis strains from 
      Australia (isolated between 2006 and 2018) were more susceptible to antibiotics 
      in comparison with microbial keratitis strains from the USA (isolated in 2004). 
      Most of the strains were multidrug-resistant. There was variability in the 
      susceptibility of contact lens isolates to MPDSs with one S. aureus strain, S. 
      aureus 27, isolated from niCIE, in Australia in 1997 being highly resistant to 
      all four MPDSs and three different types of antibiotics. Knowledge of the rates 
      of resistance to antibiotics in different conditions and regions could help guide 
      treatment of these diseases.

TI  - Clinical Concept Extraction with Lexical Semantics to Support Automatic 
      Annotation.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph182010564 [doi]
LID - 10564
AB  - Extracting clinical concepts, such as problems, diagnosis, and treatment, from 
      unstructured clinical narrative documents enables data-driven approaches such as 
      machine and deep learning to support advanced applications such as clinical 
      decision-support systems, the assessment of disease progression, and the 
      intelligent analysis of treatment efficacy. Various tools such as cTAKES, Sophia, 
      MetaMap, and other rules-based approaches and algorithms have been used for 
      automatic concept extraction. Recently, machine- and deep-learning approaches 
      have been used to extract, classify, and accurately annotate terms and phrases. 
      However, the requirement of an annotated dataset, which is labor-intensive, 
      impedes the success of data-driven approaches. A rule-based mechanism could 
      support the process of annotation, but existing rule-based approaches fail to 
      adequately capture contextual, syntactic, and semantic patterns. This study 
      intends to introduce a comprehensive rule-based system that automatically 
      extracts clinical concepts from unstructured narratives with higher accuracy and 
      transparency. The proposed system is a pipelined approach, capable of recognizing 
      clinical concepts of three types, problem, treatment, and test, in the dataset 
      collected from a published repository as a part of the I2b2 challenge 2010. The 
      system's performance is compared with that of three existing systems: Quick UMLS, 
      BIO-CRF, and the Rules (i2b2) model. Compared to the baseline systems, the 
      average F1-score of 72.94% was found to be 13% better than Quick UMLS, 3% better 
      than BIO CRF, and 30.1% better than the Rules (i2b2) model. Individually, the 
      system performance was noticeably higher for problem-related concepts, with an 
      F1-score of 80.45%, followed by treatment-related concepts and test-related 
      concepts, with F1-scores of 76.06% and 55.3%, respectively. The proposed 
      methodology significantly improves the performance of concept extraction from 
      unstructured clinical narratives by exploiting the linguistic and lexical 
      semantic features. The approach can ease the automatic annotation process of 
      clinical data, which ultimately improves the performance of supervised 
      data-driven applications trained with these data.

AB  - Climate induced disasters, more specifically floods, have caused severe damage to 
      the agriculture sector in Pakistan. These climatic risks have constrained the 
      farming community to adopt risk management strategies to overcome such climate 
      change risks. This research work attempted to examine the association of risk 
      management tools with farmers' perception of risk, risk averse attitude, and 
      various socioeconomic factors. The study has employed the sample data of 398 
      farmers from two high-risk flood-prone districts of Punjab, Pakistan. The 
      multivariate probit model was used in this study to investigate the association 
      of dependent and independent variables. The findings of the study indicated that 
      small farmers consider heavy rains and floods severe risks to their agricultural 
      production and are more risk averse than large farmers. Estimates of a 
      multivariate probit model interpreted as age of farmer (0.036), heavy rains risk 
      perception (0.597), and landholding size (0.114) were positively related with the 
      risk management tool of depletion of assets. Farmers' education (0.056), off-farm 
      income (3.47), age (0.018), and risk averse attitude of farmer (0.687) were 
      positive, whereas experience of farming (-0.037) was negatively linked with 
      reduction of consumption. Furthermore, experience of farming (0.005), risk averse 
      attitude (0.493), heavy rains (0.481), and flood risk perception (0.536) were 
      positively related with diversification adoption. The flood-prone farming 
      community is more vulnerable to these climatic risks and rely on traditional 
      strategies for risk management. There is a need to adopt crop diversification 
      based on developing research capacity for innovative crop varieties having 
      resistance to floods and climate change affects. Some significant policy 
      measures, such as a more resilient scenario of climate change and floods, need to 
      stimulate activities of enterprise diversification, opportunities of diversifying 
      employment, and strengthening activities of off-farm employment for the sound 
      livelihood of flood-prone farmers and to minimize severe affects of climatic 
      risks.

AB  - On March 11, 2020, the novel Corona virus disease (COVID-19), was described as a 
      pandemic by World Health Organization (WHO). Globally, the COVID-19 has not only 
      affected the public health socially but also has rigorously affected 
      economically. Substantial declines in income, increase in unemployment, and 
      distractions in the transportation, amenities, and industrial sectors are amongst 
      the major concerns of the pandemic disease extenuation. Furthermore, the 
      governments of most of the countries underestimated the menaces of COVID-19 
      spread and were typically responsive for the calamities in their respective 
      countries. As outbreak of this pandemic is not likely to wane in the nearby 
      future, preventive actions are prerequisite to prevent infection spread, save 
      people lives and also to save the economic affluence. In this review, based on 
      the present knowledge and available literature, we have demonstrated the various 
      aspects of pre-and post-COVID-19 effects over the social and economic phases 
      worldwide. Moreover, the evidence based data have been summarized regarding 
      threats, social influences, scientific upgrades, moral dynamics, stress and 
      adapting in the pre- and post- COVID-19 situations.

AB  - In current study, Maize (Zea mays L.) husk leave extracts were appraised for 
      biological activities such as cytotoxicity, antidiabetic, antioxidant and 
      antimicrobial. Maceration was performed to collect various fractions of husk 
      leave extracts using a pool of solvents i.e., n-hexane, chloroform, ethyl 
      acetate, butanol and methanol. Antioxidant potential was measured by 
      1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, reducing power and linoleic acid 
      oxidation assay, using butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT) as a positive control. 
      Total phenolic and flavonoid contents were found to be 18.47-425.11 mg/100 g GAE 
      and 5.83-16.72 mg/100 g CE, respectively. The DPPH scavenging assay was exhibited 
      in the range of 76.36 to 88.53%. The percentage inhibition in linoleic acid 
      oxidation was found from 10.16 to 79.51%. Significant antimicrobial activity was 
      demonstrated by husk leaf extracts against bacterial strains and fungal strains 
      using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. Amylase 
      alpha assay was employed to analyze the antidiabetic activity which ranged 
      between 9.52-24.81%. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by % age lysis (0.35-9.54%), 
      while thrombolytic activity ranged between 7.67 to 31.27%. The results presented 
      in this study revealed that maize (Zea mays L.) husk leaf extracts can be a 
      valuable source of biologically active compounds and may be consumed as a source 
      of potent herbal medicine in pharmaceuticals.

TI  - Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors Improve Cardiovascular Dysfunction in 
      Type 2 Diabetic East Asians.
LID - 10.3390/metabo11110794 [doi]
LID - 794
AB  - In East Asians, the incidence of type 2 DM (T2DM) has increased as a result of 
      major alterations in life. Cardiovascular problems are more likely in those with 
      T2DM. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are novel 
      insulin-independent antihyperglycemic drugs that limit renal glucose reabsorption 
      and thereby improve glycemic control. They are used alone or in combination with 
      insulin and other antihyperglycemic medications to treat diabetes, and they are 
      also helpful in protecting against the progression of complications. This review 
      has evaluated the available evidence not only on the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors 
      in T2DM, but also on their favourable cardiovascular events in East Asians. DM is 
      an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. As a result, in addition 
      to glycemic control in diabetes management, the therapeutic goal in East Asian 
      diabetic patients should be to improve adverse cardiovascular outcomes. Besides 
      establishing antidiabetic effects, several studies have reported cardioprotective 
      benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors via numerous pathways. SGLT2 inhibitors show 
      promising antidiabetic drugs with potential cardiovascular advantages, given that 
      a high number of diabetic patients in East Asia have co-existing cardiovascular 
      disorders. Despite significant positive results in favour of SGLT2, more research 
      is needed to determine how SGLT2 inhibitors exert these impressive cardiovascular 
      effects.

TI  - The Antifungal Activity of Ag/CHI NPs against Rhizoctonia solani Linked with 
      Tomato Plant Health.
LID - 10.3390/plants10112283 [doi]
LID - 2283
AB  - Pathogenic infestations are significant threats to vegetable yield, and have 
      become an urgent problem to be solved. Rhizoctonia solani is one of the worst 
      fungi affecting tomato crops, reducing yield in some regions. It is a known fact 
      that plants have their own defense against such infestations; however, it is 
      unclear whether any exogenous material can help plants against infestation. 
      Therefore, we performed greenhouse experiments to evaluate the impacts of R. 
      solani on 15- and 30-day old tomato plants after fungal infestation, and 
      estimated the antifungal activity of nanoparticles (NPs) against the pathogen. We 
      observed severe pathogenic impacts on the above-ground tissues of tomato plants 
      which would affect plant physiology and crop production. Pathogenic infection 
      reduced total chlorophyll and anthocyanin contents, which subsequently disturbed 
      plant physiology. Further, total phenolic contents (TPC), total flavonoid 
      contents (TFC), and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly increased 
      in pathogen treatments. Constitutively, enhanced activities were estimated for 
      catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in 
      response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)in pathogen-treated plants. Moreover, 
      pathogenesis-related genes, namely, chitinase, plant glutathione S-transferase 
      (GST), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL1), pathogenesis-related protein (PR12), 
      and pathogenesis-related protein (PR1) were evaluated, with significant 
      differences between treated and control plants. In vitro and greenhouse 
      antifungal activity of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), chitosan nanoparticles, and 
      Ag NPs/CHI NPs composites and plant health was studied using transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 
      spectrophotometry. We found astonishing results, namely, that Ag and CHI have 
      antifungal activities against R. solani. Overall, plant health was much improved 
      following treatment with Ag NPs/CHI NPs composites. In order to manage R. solani 
      pathogenicity and improve tomato health, Ag/CHI NPs composites could be used 
      infield as well as on commercial levels based on recommendations. However, there 
      is an urgent need to first evaluate whether these NP composites have any 
      secondary impacts on human health or the environment.

TI  - Morphological Characterization and DNA Barcoding of Duckweed Species in Saudi 
      Arabia.
LID - 10.3390/plants10112438 [doi]
LID - 2438
AB  - Duckweeds, or Lemnaceae, are widespread aquatic plants. Morphology-based 
      identification of duckweed species is difficult because of their structural 
      complexity. Hence, molecular tools provide significant advantages for 
      characterizing and selecting species or clones for sustainable commercial use. In 
      this study, we collected and characterized ten duckweed isolates from nine 
      different regions in Saudi Arabia (SA). Based on the morphological 
      characterization and phylogenetic analysis of intergenic spacer sequences of 
      chloroplast DNA using six barcoding markers, the clones were classified into 
      three genera, represented by seven species: Lemna gibba L., Lemna minor L., Lemna 
      japonica Landolt, Lemna aequinoctialis Welw., Lemna perpusilla Torr., Spirodela 
      polyryiza (L.) Schleid., and Landoltia punctate G. Mey. Lemna gibba was revealed 
      to be a distinct dominant duckweed species in many regions of SA. Five barcoding 
      markers showed that L. gibba, L. minor, and L. punctata were the most widely 
      distributed species in the country. However, L. punctata, L. perpusilla, and S. 
      polyryiza were the dominant species in the Al-Qassim, Madinah-1, and Madinah-2 
      regions, respectively. Moreover, the morphological traits revealed variations for 
      these clones, relative to other studied duckweed clones. According to the results 
      obtained in this study, three out of six plastid markers (trnH-psbA, matK, and 
      atpF-atpH) helped to identify the dominant duckweed species in Saudi Arabia. 
      Further evaluation based on adaptability, molecular genetic studies, and 
      functional genomics is needed for these species to be used at the commercial 
      level in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - The phytogenic flavanol component of the plant Rhusverniciflua Stokes is fustin 
      which is implicated in various disease aliments and has promising therapeutic 
      efficacy and a long history of its uses in the Indian medicinal system. The 
      present study investigated the ameliorative effect of fustin in streptozotocin 
      (STZ) induced cognitive impairments in the diabetic animal paradigm. A total of 
      five different animal groups were used for the present study.The preclinical 
      efficacy of fustin at 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg was studied in diabetic male rats by 
      employing a 35-day study design. In the present investigation the Morris water 
      maze test (MWM) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test were employed as behavioral 
      paradigms for the assessment of memory impairments. The study design also carried 
      out certain biochemical parameters which include glutathione (GSH), superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide 
      (NO), relative interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1B in samples obtained from cerebral 
      cortex and hippocampus. The behavioral parameters with MWM and EPM were 
      significant restored in fustin treatment groups as compared to elevated levels in 
      the diabetic control group. Furthermore, fustin significantly improved the 
      altered levels of several biochemical parameters for cognitive dysfunction such 
      as GSH, SOD, CAT, MDA, NO, and relative IL-6 and IL-1B compared to a diabetic 
      control group. The present investigation highlights certain preclinical pieces of 
      evidence that strongly indicate that fustin might restore the normal cognitive 
      function in the experimental animal paradigm.

AB  - Streptozotocin (STZ) 60 mg/kg, i.p.-induced diabetes in rat's results into 
      hyperglycemia, impaired oxidative stress, lipid profile, insulin levels and 
      changes in body weight. Treatment with antihyperglycemics and antioxidants are 
      accounted to produce favorable effect in this paradigm. Fustin, a flavonoid 
      derived from Rhus verniciflua, extract of Rhus verniciflua reported to exhibit 
      anti-hyperglycemic, antioxidant, anti-microbial, anti-arthritic effects, 
      anti-obesity effects, antiplatelet effects and anti-cancer effects. However, no 
      evidence is existing on effect of fustin on STZ-induction diabetes. Thus, we 
      evaluated its effects against diabetes in STZ-induced rodents. Blood glucose, 
      Insulin, lipid peroxidation (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity 
      (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and lipid profile levels was assessed. After 30 days 
      diabetes induction rodents showed a severe increased blood sugar level, MDA, high 
      density lipid and decreased cholestrol, triglyceride, GSH, SOD, CAT, 
      respectively. Oppositely, treatment with fustin (50-100 mg/kg/p.o., two times 
      daily, 30 days) enhanced blood glucose, lipid profile levels Insulin. Meanwhile, 
      reduced MDA and enhanced GSH, SOD, and CAT in diabetic rats. Glibenclamide 
      5 mg/kg/p.o. also enhanced diabetes-induced complications and decreased oxidative 
      stress. Further histopathology of pancreas confirms the protective effect fustin 
      in STZ-induction diabetes in animals. In conclusion, the study revealed 
      treatments with fustin avoid the changes in body weight, blood glucose, lipid 
      profile and oxidative stress. As a results of these finding may lead to the 
      growth of a choice of medicine for hyperglycemic in the future.

TI  - Perception, Willingness, Barriers, and Hesitancy Towards COVID-19 Vaccine in 
      Pakistan: Comparison Between Healthcare Workers and General Population.

AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy has been a huge challenge in controlling preventable 
      diseases. With the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, it 
      is vital to know their acceptance rates among the masses. No comparative data is 
      available on the current subject from Pakistan yet. Therefore, this study aimed 
      to evaluate the acceptance of a potential COVID-19 vaccine among the general 
      population and healthcare workers (HCWs) of Pakistan, along with their 
      perceptions and barriers to acceptance. Methods An online cross-sectional study 
      was carried out in Pakistan from December 19, 2020, to January 10, 2021, using 
      convenience sampling. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of 31 items 
      was distributed after informed consent. Inclusion criteria consisted of HCWs and 
      non-HCWs (general population) aged 18 years and above, residing in Pakistan. All 
      analyses were done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 
      23.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Chi-square and T-test were used and a p-value 
      of less than 0.05 was considered significant for all cases. Results Of the 404 
      respondents (n=196 general population and n=208 HCWs), 73.5% were willing to get 
      a proven, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccine if it was free of cost. This was 
      reduced to only 64.3% if the vaccine was not free and had to be paid for. A total 
      of 168 (41.6%) participants agreed to get vaccinated immediately, while 149 
      (36.9%) participants concurred to get it on a delayed basis. Eighty-seven (21.5%) 
      participants refused to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, amongst which a significant 
      majority (p<0.001) of the participants were from the general population. Doctors 
      or scientists/scholarly journals were found to be the most trusted source of 
      information (67.6%; n=273), while fear of unknown side effects (45.5%; n=184) was 
      found to be the most common barrier towards COVID-19 vaccination. More than half 
      (53.5%) participants believed that the vaccine is safe, effective, and has 
      minimal side effects, amongst which a significantly large fraction (p<0.001) 
      belonged to the HCWs. Conclusion The acceptance rate of a safe, effective, 
      proven, and free COVID-19 vaccine was 73.5%. The fear of unknown side effects was 
      the most common barrier to COVID-19 vaccine uptake. The general population 
      demonstrated less knowledge, more false perceptions, and barriers to COVID-19 
      vaccine. Adequate measures should be taken to educate the masses about the 
      COVID-19 vaccine, and its safety, and further studies are required.

AB  - AIMS: 1) To determine the pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity in people 
      with severe mental illness (SMI), overall and by type of SMI, geographical 
      region, and year of data collection; and 2) to assess the likelihood of 
      overweight and obesity, in people with SMI compared with the general population. 
      METHODS: PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases were searched to 
      identify observational studies assessing the prevalence of obesity in adults with 
      SMI. Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessments were performed 
      independently by two co-authors. Random effect estimates for the pooled 
      prevalence of overweight and obesity and the pooled odds of obesity in people 
      with SMI compared with the general population were calculated. Subgroup analyses 
      were conducted for types of SMI, setting, antipsychotic medication, region of the 
      world, country income classification, date of data collection and sex. We 
      assessed publication bias and performed a series of sensitivity analyses, 
      excluding studies with high risk of bias, with low sample size and those not 
      reporting obesity according to WHO classification. RESULT: 120 studies from 43 
      countries were included, the majority were from high income countries. The pooled 
      prevalence of obesity in people with SMI was 25.9% (95% C.I. = 23.3-29.1) and the 
      combined pooled prevalence of overweight and obesity was 60.1% (95% C.I. = 
      55.8-63.1). Sub-Saharan Africa (13.0%, 95%C.I. = 6.7-25.1) and South Asia (17.7%, 
      95%C.I. = 10.5-28.5) had the lowest prevalence of obesity whilst North Africa and 
      the Middle East (35.8%, 95%C.I. = 23.8-44.8) reported the highest prevalence. 
      People with SMI were 3.04 more likely (95% C.I. = 2.42-3.82) to have obesity than 
      the general population, but there was no difference in the prevalence of 
      overweight. Women with schizophrenia were 1.44 (95% C.I. = 1.25-1.67) times more 
      likely than men with schizophrenia to live with obesity; however, no gender 
      differences were found among those with bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION: People with 
      SMI have a markedly high prevalence and higher odds of obesity than the general 
      population. This may contribute to the very high prevalence of physical health 
      conditions and mortality in this group. People with SMI around the world would 
      likely benefit from interventions to reduce and prevent obesity.

AB  - Recessive gene mutations underlie many developmental disorders and often lead to 
      disabling neurological problems. Here, we report identification of a homozygous 
      c.170G>A (p.Cys57Tyr or C57Y) mutation in the gene coding for protein disulfide 
      isomerase A3 (PDIA3, also known as ERp57), an enzyme that catalyzes formation of 
      disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum, to be associated with syndromic 
      intellectual disability. Experiments in zebrafish embryos show that PDIA3(C57Y) 
      expression is pathogenic and causes developmental defects such as axonal 
      disorganization as well as skeletal abnormalities. Expression of PDIA3(C57Y) in 
      the mouse hippocampus results in impaired synaptic plasticity and memory 
      consolidation. Proteomic and functional analyses reveal that PDIA3(C57Y) 
      expression leads to dysregulation of cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton 
      dynamics, associated with altered integrin biogenesis and reduced neuritogenesis. 
      Biochemical studies show that PDIA3(C57Y) has decreased catalytic activity and 
      forms disulfide-crosslinked aggregates that abnormally interact with chaperones 
      in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, rare disease gene variant can provide insight 
      into how perturbations of neuronal proteostasis can affect the function of the 
      nervous system.

AB  - The present investigation was committed to examining the effect of soil spiked 
      with diesel contamination (0, 1.5, 2.5, 3.5 g diesel kg(-1) soil) on maize (Zea 
      mays L) varieties (MMRI yellow and Pearl white) with or without bacterial 
      consortium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa BRRI54, Acinetobacter sp. strain BRSI56, 
      Acinetobacter sp. strain ACRH80). Seed and soil bacterial inoculation were done. 
      The studied morphological attributes were fresh and dry weight of shoot and root 
      of both maize varieties. The results documented that bacterial consortium caused 
      21%, 0.06% and 29%, 34% higher shoot and root fresh/dry weights in "Pearl white" 
      and 14%, 15% and 32%, 22% shoot and root fresh/dry weights respectively in MMRI 
      yellow under control conditions. The biochemical attributes of shoot and root 
      were affected negatively by the 3.5 g diesel kg(-1) soil contamination. Bacterial 
      consortium enhanced enzymatic activity (APX, CAT, POD, SOD, GR) and non-enzymatic 
      (AsA, GSH, Pro, alpha-Toco) antioxidant and reduction in oxidative stress (H(2)O(2), 
      MDA) under hydrocarbon stress as compared to non-inoculated ones in both root and 
      shoot organs. Among both varieties, the highest hydrocarbon removal (75, 64, and 
      69%) was demonstrated by MMRI yellow with bacterial consortium as compare to 
      Pearl white showed 73, 57, 65% hydrocarbon degradation at 1.5 2.5, 3.5 g diesel 
      kg(-1) soil contamination. Consequently, the microbe mediated biotransformation 
      of hydrocarbons suggested that the use of PGPB would be the most beneficial 
      selection in diesel fuel contaminated soil to overcome the abiotic stress in 
      plants and successfully remediation of hydrocarbon in contaminated soil.

TI  - Current Overview on Therapeutic Potential of Vitamin D in Inflammatory Lung 
      Diseases.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines9121843 [doi]
LID - 1843
AB  - Inflammatory lung disorders (ILDs) are one of the world's major reasons for 
      fatalities and sickness, impacting millions of individuals of all ages and 
      constituting a severe and pervasive health hazard. Asthma, lung cancer, 
      bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis acute respiratory distress syndrome, and COPD 
      all include inflammation as a significant component. Microbe invasions, as well 
      as the damage and even death of host cells, can cause and sustain inflammation. 
      To counteract the negative consequences of irritants, the airways are equipped 
      with cellular and host defense immunological systems that block the cellular 
      entrance of these irritants or eliminate them from airway regions by triggering 
      the immune system. Failure to activate the host defense system will trigger 
      chronic inflammatory cataracts, leading to permanent lung damage. This damage 
      makes the lungs more susceptible to various respiratory diseases. There are 
      certain restrictions of the available therapy for lung illnesses. Vitamins are 
      nutritional molecules that are required for optimal health but are not produced 
      by the human body. Cholecalciferol (Vitamin D) is classified as a vitamin, 
      although it is a hormone. Vitamin D is thought to perform a function in bone and 
      calcium homeostasis. Recent research has found that vitamin D can perform a 
      variety of cellular processes, including cellular proliferation; differentiation; 
      wound repair; healing; and regulatory systems, such as the immune response, 
      immunological, and inflammation. The actions of vitamin D on inflammatory cells 
      are dissected in this review, as well as their clinical significance in 
      respiratory illnesses.

AB  - The use of constructed wetlands (CWs) is a promising approach for the remediation 
      of hydrocarbon-polluted wastewater. The amendments of CWs with nutrients, 
      surfactants, and aeration enhances the removal of pollutants from wastewater. The 
      objective of the present study was to explore the effect of external stimulants, 
      i.e., nutrients, surfactant, and aeration on hydrocarbons degradation potential 
      of CWs. The CWs mesocosms were developed by the vegetation of Phragmites 
      australis and amendments with nutrients (20 mg l(-1) N, 2.6 mg l(-1) P, and 
      16.4 mg l(-1) K), surfactant Tween 20 (0.2%, v/v), and aeration (7 mg l(-1)) for 
      the remediation of diesel-spiked water (2%, w/v). The comparative analysis showed 
      that the addition of nutrients, surfactant, and aeration individually enhanced 
      total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) reduction, and maximum TPHs reduction (88.4%) 
      was achieved after 60 days in the mesocosms amended with the combination of 
      nutrients, surfactant, and aeration. Among different individual treatments, the 
      aeration (alone) also played a pivotal role in TPHs reduction (61%). The least 
      (12%) reduction in TPHs was achieved in the mesocosms supplied with surfactant 
      only. This study revealed that the combined application of nutrients, surfactant, 
      and aeration in CWs enhanced its hydrocarbons degradation performance.

OAB - The biodegradability of crude oil-polluted wastewater is not efficient. It is 
      mainly due to the low bioavailability of hydrocarbons, and less amount of 
      nutrients and dissolved oxygen in the wastewater. This study explores the 
      importance of the amendments of nutrients, surfactant, and aeration on the 
      enhanced performance of constructed wetlands (CWs) for the remediation of 
      hydrocarbon-contaminated water. The application of nutrients, surfactant, and 
      aeration in CWs not only enhanced hydrocarbon degradation and toxicity reduction 
      but also improved plant growth.

TI  - Formulation and Evaluation of Kaempferol Loaded Nanoparticles against 
      Experimentally Induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13122086 [doi]
LID - 2086
AB  - The present study was designed to prepare Kaempferol loaded nanoparticles 
      (KFP-Np) and evaluate hepatoprotective and antioxidant effects in hepatocellular 
      carcinoma models. KFP was encapsulated with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate 
      succinate (HPMC-AS) and Kollicoat MAE 30 DP polymers to prepare nanoparticles 
      (Nps) by quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion technique (QESD). The prepared Nps were 
      evaluated for different pharmaceutical characterization to select the optimum 
      composition for the in vivo assessment. An animal model of cadmium chloride 
      (CdCl(2))-induced hepatocellular carcinoma in Male Sprague Dawley rats was used 
      in vivo to test the antioxidant and hepatoprotective capacity of free and 
      encapsulated KFP. The prepared Npsshowed nanometric size, low PDI, high drug load 
      as well as encapsulation with a better drug release profile. There was a 
      significant decrease in the increased serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT), 
      total bilirubin (TBiL), and aspartate transaminase (AST), and the lipid 
      peroxidation's (MDA) level was attenuated, and levels of markers of the cell 
      antioxidant defence system were restored including Glutathione S-transferase 
      (GST), glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) via oral 
      pre-treatment with KFP-Np (50 mg/kg b.w. (body weight), 6 weeks). KFP-Np 
      significantly declines an mRNA expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as well as decreased nuclear factor 
      kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) protein expression. It 
      also upregulated the mRNA expression and protein expression of nuclear factor 
      erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). While comparing 
      the protective effects of KFP encapsulated in Kollicoat MAE 30 DP and HPMC-AS, 
      Nps was found to be betterthan free KFP. Insummary, result indicate that 
      encapsulation of KFP in NPs provides a potential platform for oxidative stress 
      induce liver injury.

      been shown to protect the mouse hippocampus HT22 cells from glutamate-induced 
      neurotoxicity. The current investigation was planned to assess anti-Huntington's 
      effect of butin in 3-nitropropionic acid-treated rats. A total of 32 Wistar rats 
      (200-240 g) were equally segregated into four groups. Groups I and II were 
      treated with vehicle (0.3 ml/100 g) and groups III and IV received butin 25 and 
      50 mg/kg for 15 days. Daily 1 h post above oral treatments, 3 ml/kg of normal 
      saline was injected (i.p.) to group I animals and 10 mg/kg of 3-NP was injected 
      (i.p.) to II and IV groups for 15 days. During the experimental schedule, 
      behavioral tests were conducted for animals. On day 15, after behavioral 
      parameters, animals were sacrificed and brains were removed for biochemical 
      tests. Systemic administration of 3-NP induced neurobehavioral deficits which 
      resulted in reduced spontaneous locomotor activity, motor incoordination, 
      learning ability, and memory in the animals. Moreover, 3-NP depleted endogenous 
      antioxidants (GSH, catalase, and SOD), mitochondrial complexes activities (I, II, 
      IV, and MTT assay), elevated LDH, MDA, nitrite, and AchE. Administration of butin 
      significantly improved neurobehavioral impairments, nitrative and oxidative 
      stress, activities of mitochondrial enzyme complex, and reduced AchE levels in 
      rat brain.

AB  - Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) represent the latest technological 
      transformation in healthcare for assisting clinicians in complex decision-making. 
      Several CDSSs are proposed to deal with a range of clinical tasks such as disease 
      diagnosis, prescription management, and medication ordering. Although a small 
      number of CDSSs have focused on treatment selection, areas such as medication 
      selection and dosing selection remained under-researched. In this regard, this 
      study represents one of the first studies in which a CDSS is proposed for 
      clinicians who manage patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing 
      maintenance hemodialysis, almost all of whom have some manifestation of chronic 
      kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). The primary objective of the 
      system is to aid clinicians in dosage prescription by levering medical domain 
      knowledge as well existing practices. The proposed CDSS is evaluated with a 
      real-world hemodialysis patient dataset acquired from Kyung Hee University 
      Hospital, South Korea. Our evaluation demonstrates overall high compliance based 
      on the concordance metric between the proposed CKD-MBD CDSS recommendations and 
      the routine clinical practice. The concordance rate of overall medication dosing 
      selection is 78.27%. Furthermore, the usability aspects of the system are also 
      evaluated through the User Experience Questionnaire method to highlight the 
      appealing aspects of the system for clinicians. The overall user experience 
      dimension scores for pragmatic, hedonic, and attractiveness are 1.53, 1.48, and 
      1.41, respectively. A service reliability for the Cronbach's alpha coefficient 
      greater than 0.7 is achieved using the proposed system, whereas a dependability 
      coefficient of the value 0.84 reveals a significant effect.

      Behavior via Inhibition of Oxidative Stress-Influenced Expressions of 
      Inflammatory Mediators TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and BDNF: Insight into the Mechanism.

AB  - Anxiety and depression are among the major traumatic brain injury-induced 
      psychiatric disorders in survivors. The present study was undertaken to 
      investigate the beneficial effects of 6-Shogaol against depression-like behavior 
      and anxiety, induced by traumatic brain injury (TBI), in mice. The mice were 
      administered either fluoxetine, vehicle, or three different doses (10, 20 and 30 
      mg/kg/day, i.p.) of 6-Shogaol after 10 days of impact-accelerated TBI. The 
      treatment was continued for 14 consecutive days. Elevated plus maze test, marble 
      burying test, staircase test, and social interaction test were employed to 
      investigate the effect of 6-Shogaol on anxiety-like behavior. The impact of 
      treatment on depression-like behavior was assessed using hyper-emotionality 
      behavior or open-field exploration test. The expressions of brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta 
      (IL-1beta), and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in brain tissue and brain water were 
      measured to elucidate possible mechanisms involved. 6-Shogaol treatment (higher 
      dose) was able to attenuate anxiety/depression-like behaviors in mice with TBI. 
      6-Shogaol treatment also altered MDA formation and expressions of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta 
      that act as major inflammation-inducing cytokines in brain tissue. Additionally, 
      brain BDNF levels were also affected by 6-Shogaol treatment. Although the lower 
      dose of 6-Shogaol was able to rectify inflammation and BDNF expression in brain 
      tissue, it was unable to improve anxiety/depression-like behaviors. 6-Shogaol 
      treatment produced beneficial effects for TBI-induced anxiety/depression-like 
      behaviors in mice, which could be attributed to the reduction of lipid 
      peroxidation, inflammation, and enhanced BDNF expression.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to report eyelid myokymia in patients recently 
      recovered from COVID-19 disease. A cohort of 15 patients who developed eyelid 
      myokymia during or immediate post-recovery of systemic disease were evaluated. 
      Demographic, clinical characteristics, effect of age, and hospitalization on the 
      disease course were studied. The disease course was evaluated every month for 
      3 months period. All, except 2, patients had complete resolution of lid myokymia 
      within 3 months of onset. Median [IQR] myokymia recovery time was 42 [31,60] 
      days. Age and duration of hospitalization had a significant linear relationship 
      with myokymia recovery time. Recovery was delayed by 2.64 days with every 1-year 
      increment in age and by 6.19 days with every additional day of hospital stay. 
      Recovery time was independent of severity of systemic disease (P = .055) and 
      gender (P = 0.2). Eyelid myokymia can be a possible manifestation of COVID-19 
      recovery phase. While myokymia recovers gradually in all these patients, older 
      age and a longer duration of hospitalization are associated with slower recovery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of mortality is increasing in diabetic patients due to 
      diabetes-associated complications. The common complications include neuropathy, 
      nephropathy, retinopathy, foot ulcer, slow wound healing, kidney dysfunction, 
      amputation, dysfunction of organs, frequent infections, sepsis, skin diseases, 
      hearing impairment, cardiovascular disorders, etc. These complications can be 
      diagnosed following some common symptoms such as increased thirst, frequent 
      urination, extreme hunger, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, irritability, 
      blurred vision, slow-healing sores, etc. This survey was designed to study the 
      prevalence of various complications in a group of diabetic patients so that 
      effective treatment options could be developed against the most prevalent 
      complications. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019 in a 
      tertiary care hospital of Karachi after the approval of the ethical committee of 
      the hospital as well as in the University of Karachi. To perform this study, a 
      questionnaire was designed comprised of different questions related to diabetic 
      complications. The consent form was attached to each questionnaire in which the 
      patient agreed to participate voluntarily in this survey. The diabetic patients 
      who visited the General Physician OPD were the subjects of this survey. All 
      designed questions included in the questionnaire were asked either directly from 
      the patients or their attendants. RESULTS: A total of 160 diabetic subjects were 
      part of the study range between the ages of 11 to 90 years. Out of 160 patients, 
      52 were males, and 108 were females. Among all subjects, 124 (78 %) patients were 
      type 2 while 57 (36 %) were type 1 diabetic patients. 117 (73 %) showed confusion 
      of mind, 104 (65 %) complained of blood pressure, 105 (66 %) had hypertension, 
      106 (66 %) had eye damage (retinopathy), 96 (60 %) were facing trouble focusing 
      vision, and 70 (44 %) were experiencing seizures, 63 (39 %) patients had laser 
      treatment, 68 (43 %) showed wounds on foot and slow wounds healing, 49 (31 %) 
      were having kidney damage (nephropathy), 79 (49 %) had pain in legs or knee, 35 
      (22 %) and 26 (16 %) complained of heart problems and liver damage respectively. 
      Some patients were found to deal with more hunger, i.e., 99 (62 %) patients, 118 
      (74 %) were experiencing frequent urine desire, 138 (86 %) showed fatigue, 123 
      (77 %) complained of thirst, 35 (22 %) had nausea, 30 (19 %) had a frequent cold, 
      36 (23 %) had skin problems, 17 (11 %) patients showed frequent vomiting, 19 (12 
      %), 13 (8 %) and 16 (10 %) were experiencing acne formation, stroke and nerve 
      damage (neuropathy) respectively. CONCLUSION: All age groups showed 
      diabetes-associated complications and different abnormal body conditions. 
      However, the age groups ranging from thirty to eighty years showed more 
      complications. The most prevalent complications reported were retinopathy, 
      nephropathy, diabetic wounds on the foot, slow wound healing, seizures, 
      hypertension, neuropathy, skin infections, cardiovascular disorders, liver 
      damage, and stroke in both types of diabetic patients. Our survey may aid in 
      pointing out the most prevalent diabetic complications prevailing in our 
      population so that effective treatment options could be developed to reduce these 
      life-threatening complications.

AB  - mCardinal2 is a red fluorescent protein developed through the designs of mKate, 
      mNeptune and mCardinal. Fluorescence spectrums of mCardinal2 and its five mutants 
      (T143C, T143G, C158A, C158D and M160E) were measured with their quantum yields. 
      C158A and C158D increased brightness with slight changes in fluorescence 
      spectrums while T143C, T143G and M160E decreased brightness with blue shift in 
      fluorescence spectrums, which resulted in green, cyan and green fluorescent 
      proteins respectively. Crystal structures of all six variants were analyzed and 
      compared together with those of mKate, LSS-mKate1, LSS-mKate2 and mCardinal. 
      Around the Calpha-Cbeta bond of Tyr64 in the MYG chromophores, only C158A and C158D were 
      in the trans conformation while all others were mostly in the cis conformation. 
      Blue-shift brightness-decreased variants (T143C, T143G and M160E) showed the 
      diminished hydrogen bonds while large-Stoke-shift brightness-increased variant 
      C158D showed the enhanced hydrogen bonds around the chromophore.

AB  - The uropathogens is the main cause of urinary tract infection (UTI). The aim of 
      the study was to isolate bacteria from urine samples of UTI patients and find out 
      the susceptibility of isolated bacteria. Bacteria were identified using both 
      conventional and molecular methods. Sanger sequence procedure used for 16S 
      ribosomal RNA and phylogenetic analysis was performed using Molecular 
      Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA-7) software. In this study, Escherichia 
      coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus were reported as 58, 28 and 14.0% 
      respectively. Phylogenetic tree revealed that 99% of sample No. Ai (05) is 
      closely related to E. coli to (NR 114042.1 E. coli strain NBRC 102203). Aii (23) 
      is 99% similar to K. pneumoniae to (NR 117686.1 K. pneumonia strain DSM 30104) 
      and 90% Bi (48) is closely linked to S. aureus to (NR 113956.1 S. aureus strain 
      NBRC 100910). The antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli recorded highest 
      resistance towards ampicillin (90%) and least resistant to ofloxacin (14%). Some 
      of the other antibiotics such amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, 
      ceftazidime, cefuroxime and nitrofurantoin resistance were observed 86, 62, 24, 
      55, 48 and 35% respectively. The cefuroxime showed the highest antibiotic 
      resistance against K. pneumoniae with 85% followed by amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, 
      gentamicin, ceftazidime, ampicillin and nitrofurantoin resulted in 60, 45, 67, 
      70, 75 and 30% respectively. The resistance of S. aureus against erythromycin, 
      cefuroxime and ampicillin were found with 72%. The resistance against 
      amoxicillin, gentamicin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone found 57, 43, 43 and 15% 
      respectively. Phylogenetic analysis shows that sequences are closely related with 
      the reference sequences and E. coli is the dominant bacteria among UTI patients 
      and is resistant to the commercially available antibiotics.

AB  - The acoustic performance of a silencer containing elastic membranes backed by 
      cavities and porous material is investigated. The modeled waveguide configuration 
      contains porous screens as well as the metallic fairings at interfaces between 
      the inlet and outlet and the expansion chamber. The mode-matching solution is 
      developed to analyze the attenuation of the silencer. The governing 
      eigen-sub-systems are Sturm-Liouville and non-Sturm-Liouville types. In the 
      latter case, the exploitation of generalized orthogonality conditions reveals the 
      point-wise convergence of the solution to the governing eigen-systems. The study 
      shows that by tuning the material parameters of the isotropic membranes and 
      altering the bounding wall conditions, the performance of the physical device can 
      be improved. It enables the model configuration to be adopted as a passive or 
      reactive noise control device.

TI  - Mental health crisis in Somalia: a review and a way forward.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/s13033-022-00525-y [doi]
LID - 12
AB  - BACKGROUND: Somalia has been without an effective government since the collapse 
      of the military regime in 1991. Years of conflict, disasters, and insecurity have 
      all contributed to very low scores for most health indicators due to poor 
      governance, protracted conflict, underdevelopment, economic decline, poverty, 
      social and gender inequality, and environmental degradation. The three-decade 
      long protracted conflict has led to widespread psychosocial trauma, social 
      deprivation and substance abuse with devastating consequences on mental health. A 
      WHO study showed Somalia has one of the highest rates of mental illness in the 
      world. The main aim of this study is to assist policy makers in setting 
      priorities for the design and delivery of interventions to promote mental health 
      and psychosocial wellbeing in Somalia. METHODS: The study uses a systematic 
      mapping technique (from January 1991 to May 2020) and data collected from public 
      domain, to collect, collate, and present mental health data mainly from WHO's 
      Global Health Observatory. Since there is no primary database for Somalia's 
      public health research, the bibliographic databases used for mental health in 
      this study included Medline, PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar. Data 
      were extracted using techniques for web data mining for public health. RESULTS: 
      Systematic mapping of mental health-related issues in Somalia showed that 
      policy-related determinants and mental health services dominated (74.4%), 
      followed by the disaster-related determinants and women's health consequences 
      (39.3%). The ratio of the number of beds for mental health in general hospitals 
      (per 100,000 population) in Somalia in 2017 is 0.5 compared to the Eastern 
      Mediterranean region (EMR) at 6.4 and globally at 24. One of the biggest 
      casualties of the civil war was loss of essential human resources in healthcare 
      as most either fled the country or were part of the victims of the war. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The vast scale of the mental health problems in Somalia and the 
      priority setting guidelines for interventions to address the issues outlined in 
      this paper, prompt a dire need that the Somali government and its 
      national/international partners should prioritize and emphasize the need to 
      invest in the prevention and the treatment of mental illness across the country.

TI  - Genetic association study of ERBB4 SNP rs1351592 with polycystic ovary syndrome 
      in Pakistani population.
PG  - 332-335
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.1026 [doi]
AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an oligogenic condition characterised by 
      hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction and polycystic ovarian morphology. 
      Previously, European and Han Chinese populations identified different 
      susceptibility loci, of which ERBB4 (rs1351592) was strongly associated with 
      PCOS. Our study aimed to investigate the association of ERBB4 Single Nucleotide 
      Polymorphism (SNP), rs1351592 with PCOS in Pakistani women of Hazara region. 
      Fifty PCOS patients and 14 healthy women were recruited and SNP was replicated 
      using ARMS-PCR and sequencing. The study showed that Luteinising Hormone (LH), 
      Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH), and Testosterone (T) were significantly 
      elevated in patients compared to controls (P <0.05). Overall, the frequency of G 
      allele was higher than C allele and the SNP lacked significant association with 
      PCOS. This is the first study demonstrating the association of ERBB4 SNP, 
      rs1351592 with PCOS in Pakistani population. Further research using larger 
      population size will help to estimate the role of ERBB4 SNP as potential 
      biomarker for disease diagnosis.

TI  - Exploring the relevance of NUP93 variants in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome 
      using next generation sequencing and a fly kidney model.
PG  - 2643-2656
LID - 10.1007/s00467-022-05440-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Variants in genes encoding nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins are a 
      newly identified cause of paediatric steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS). 
      Recent reports describing NUP93 variants suggest these could be a significant 
      cause of paediatric onset SRNS. We report NUP93 cases in the UK and demonstrate 
      in vivo functional effects of Nup93 depletion in a fly (Drosophila melanogaster) 
      nephrocyte model. METHODS: Three hundred thirty-seven paediatric SRNS patients 
      from the National cohort of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NephroS) were whole 
      exome and/or whole genome sequenced. Patients were screened for over 70 genes 
      known to be associated with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS). D. melanogaster Nup93 
      knockdown was achieved by RNA interference using nephrocyte-restricted drivers. 
      RESULTS: Six novel homozygous and compound heterozygous NUP93 variants were 
      detected in 3 sporadic and 2 familial paediatric onset SRNS characterised 
      histologically by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and progressing to 
      kidney failure by 12 months from clinical diagnosis. Silencing of the two 
      orthologs of human NUP93 expressed in D. melanogaster, Nup93-1, and Nup93-2 
      resulted in significant signal reduction of up to 82% in adult pericardial 
      nephrocytes with concomitant disruption of NPC protein expression. Additionally, 
      nephrocyte morphology was highly abnormal in Nup93-1 and Nup93-2 silenced flies 
      surviving to adulthood. CONCLUSION: We expand the spectrum of NUP93 variants 
      detected in paediatric onset SRNS and demonstrate its incidence within a national 
      cohort. Silencing of either D. melanogaster Nup93 ortholog caused a severe 
      nephrocyte phenotype, signaling an important role for the nucleoporin complex in 
      podocyte biology. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is 
      available as Supplementary information.

AB  - Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a widely accepted treatment approach and has 
      heightened the quality of care among physicians. PRP has been used over the last 
      decade to boost clinical results of plastic therapies, periodontal surgery and 
      intra-bony defects. According to certain research, elevated levels of PRP growth 
      factors that could promote tissue repair and have the potential for PRP to be 
      beneficial in regenerating processes that Maxillofacial and Oral Surgeons, 
      Veterinary Officers, Athletic medicine specialists and Dermatologists have long 
      admired. PRP is an autologous whole blood fraction that has a heavy amount of a 
      variety of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), Vascular 
      Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast 
      growth factors (FGFs), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-b), insulin-like 
      growth factor-I (IGF-I) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which can 
      facilitate repair and regeneration. Moreover, a clinical trial of PRP in severe 
      angina patients has shown its excellent safety profile. However, PRP is a very 
      complex biological substance with an array of active biomolecules, its functions 
      are yet to be fully clarified. In-addition, there was insufficient work assessing 
      possible cardiovascular tissue benefits from PRP. Thus, it still remains 
      necessary to identify the most clinically important cardiovascular applications 
      and further research in clinical scenario need to be validated.

AB  - The present research work was planned to evaluate the antioxidant and 
      anti-inflammatory actions of butin in preventing complete Freund's 
      adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats. Adult Wistar rats (200-240 g) were segregated 
      equally into four groups: Group I (normal) and Group II complete Freund's 
      adjuvant (CFA control) were administered orally with 3 ml/kg of 0.5% SCMC 
      (vehicle); Group III and Group IV were test groups and orally administered 25 and 
      50 mg/kg of butin. These oral treatments were administered for a total of 21 
      days. In the 21-day treatment schedule, on the first day, animals from group I 
      (normal control) were injected a single dose of normal saline (0.1 ml) 
      intradermally into one of the hind paws, and animals from Group II to IV were 
      injected CFA (0.1 ml) intradermally into one of the hind paws. During the 
      treatment schedule, the volume of the hind paw and body weight were recorded at 
      every 7 days intervals, and animals were scored for severe arthritis on days 17, 
      19, and 21. On the 22nd day, samples of blood were withdrawn by puncturing the 
      retro-orbital sinus for analysis of RBC, WBC, hemoglobin, ALT, AST, ALP, PGE2, 
      and cytokines. After blood withdrawal, animals were euthanized; the paw was 
      separated by cutting at the ankle joint and used for analysis of oxidative stress 
      and antioxidant parameters, as well as for the histopathological study. 
      Administration of butin to CFA-treated animals significantly attenuated the 
      CFA-induced inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and reversed the 
      histopathological alteration towards normal. According to the findings, butin has 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties in rats with CFA-induced 
      arthritis.

TI  - Circulating immune cell landscape in patients who had mild ischaemic stroke.
PG  - 319-327
LID - 10.1136/svn-2021-001224 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients who had a mild ischaemic stroke who present with subtle or 
      resolving symptoms sometimes go undiagnosed, are excluded from treatment and in 
      some cases clinically worsen. Circulating immune cells are potential biomarkers 
      that can assist with diagnosis in ischaemic stroke. Understanding the 
      transcriptomic changes of each cell population caused by ischaemic stroke is 
      critical because they work closely in a complicated relationship. In this study, 
      we investigated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) transcriptomics of 
      patients who had a stroke using a single-cell RNA sequencing to understand 
      peripheral immune response after mild stroke based on the gene expression in an 
      unbiased way. METHODS: Transcriptomes of PBMCsfrom 10 patients who had an acute 
      ischaemic stroke within 24 hours after stroke onset were compared with 9 
      race-matched/age-matched/gender-matched controls. Individual PBMCs were prepared 
      with ddSeq(TM) (Illumina-BioRad) and sequenced on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 
      platform. RESULTS: Notable population changes were observed in patients who had a 
      stroke, especially in NK cells and CD14+ monocytes. The number of NK cells was 
      increased, which was further confirmed by flow cytometry. Functional analysis 
      implied that the activity of NK cells also is enhanced in patients who had a 
      stroke. CD14+ monocytes were clustered into two groups; dendritic cell-related 
      CD14+ monocytes and NK cell-related CD14+ monocytes. We found CD14+ monocyte 
      subclusters were dramatically reduced in patients who had a stroke. DISCUSSION: 
      This is the first study demonstrating the increased number of NK cells and new 
      monocyte subclusters of mild ischaemic stroke based on the transcriptomic 
      analysis. Our findings provide the dynamics of circulating immune response that 
      could assist diagnosis and potential therapeutic development of mild ischaemic 
      stroke.

TI  - Response of Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) Genotypes to Heat Stress Using 
      Morphological and Expression Study.
LID - 10.3390/plants11050615 [doi]
LID - 615
AB  - Due to unfavorable environmental conditions, heat stress is one of the 
      significant production restrictions for the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) 
      crop. The tomato crop is considered an important vegetable crop globally and 
      represents a model plant for fruit development research. The heat shock factor 
      (HSF) gene family contains plant-specific transcription factors (TFs) that are 
      highly conserved and play a key role in plant high-temperature stress responses. 
      The current study was designed to determine the relative response of heat stress 
      under three different temperatures in the field condition to determine its 
      relative heat tolerance. Furthermore, the study also characterized heat shock 
      genes in eight tomato genotypes under different temperature regimes. The 
      expressions of each gene were quantified using qPCR. The descriptive statistics 
      results suggested a high range of diversity among the studied variables growing 
      under three different temperatures. The qPCR study revealed that the SlyHSF genes 
      play an important role in plant heat tolerance pathways. The expression patterns 
      of HSF genes in tomatoes have been described in various tissues were determined 
      at high temperature stress. The genes, SlyHSFs-1, SlyHSFs-2, SlyHSFs-8, SlyHSFs-9 
      recorded upregulation expression relative to SlyHSFs-3, SlyHSFs-5, SlyHSFs-10, 
      and SlyHSFs-11. The genotypes, Strain B, Marmande VF, Pearson's early, and 
      Al-Qatif-365 recorded the tolerant tomato genotypes under high-temperature stress 
      conditions relative to other genotypes. The heat map analysis also confirmed the 
      upregulation and downregulation of heat shock factor genes among the tomato 
      genotypes. These genotypes will be introduced in the breeding program to improve 
      tomato responses to heat stress.

AB  - One of the most prevailing primary brain tumors in adult human male is 
      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), which is categorized by rapid cellular growth. 
      Even though the combination therapy comprises surgery, chemotherapy, and adjuvant 
      therapies, the survival rate, on average, is 14.6 months. Glioma stem cells 
      (GSCs) have key roles in tumorigenesis, progression, and defiance against 
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In our study, firstly, the gene expression dataset 
      GSE124145 was retrieved; the non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) method was 
      applied on GBM dataset, and differentially expressed genes analysis (DEGs) was 
      performed. After which, overlapping genes between metagenes and DEGs were 
      detected to examine the Gene Ontology (GO) categories in the biological process 
      (BP) in the stemness of GBM. The common hub genes were used to construct 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and further GO, while Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway was utilized to pinpoint the 
      real hub genes. The analysis of hub genes particular for the same GO categories 
      demonstrated that specific hub genes triggered distinct features of the same 
      biological processes. After utilizing GSE124145 and The Cancer Genome Atlas 
      (TCGA) dataset for survival analysis, we screened five real hub genes: GUCA1A, 
      RFC2, GNG11, MMP19, and NRG1, which are strongly associated with the progression 
      and prognosis of GBM. The DEGs analysis revealed that all real hub genes were 
      overexpressed in GBM and TCGA datasets, which further validates our results. The 
      constructed study of PPI, GO, and KEGG pathway on common hub genes was performed. 
      Finally, the KEGG pathways performed on the top 15 candidate hub genes (including 
      six real hub genes) of the PPI network in the GBM gene expression dataset study 
      found mitogen-activated protein kinase (Mapk) signaling pathway to be the most 
      significant pathway. The rest of the hub genes reviewed throughout the analysis 
      might be favorable targets for diagnosing and treating GBM and lower-grade 
      gliomas.

TI  - Noninvasive prenatal testing of beta-thalassemia for common Pakistani mutations: 
      a comparative study using cell-free fetal DNA from maternal plasma and chorionic 
      villus sampling.
PG  - 353-359
LID - 10.1080/16078454.2022.2045052 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of circulating cell-free fetal DNA (cff-DNA) in 
      maternal plasma has inspired the noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) approaches 
      for various genetic fetal screening including rhesus D typing, sex determination, 
      aneuploidies, and single-gene disorders. OBJECTIVE: Noninvasive determination of 
      paternally inherited beta-thalassemia mutations in maternal total cell-free DNA 
      (cf-DNA) by using allele-specific amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) 
      real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in concordance with the conventional invasive method. 
      METHODS: An observational study was conducted at the Armed Forces Institute of 
      Blood Transfusion in collaboration with the genetics resource center from March 
      2021 to August 2021. A total number of 26 couples were selected having a history 
      of previously affected children with beta-thalassemia. A routine chorionic villus 
      sampling (CVS) invasive procedure was carried out, and the mutation analysis was 
      done using conventional PCR. To assess NIPT, a total cf-DNA was also extracted 
      from maternal plasma and analyzed using allele-specific ARMS RT-PCR. RESULTS: 
      Based on conventional PCR testing, 13 of 26 couples were found having 
      beta-thalassemia carriers with homozygous mutation, and 13 couples were carriers 
      with heterozygous mutations. Further to assess NIPT, the cf-DNA of 13 pregnant 
      females among the couples with different mutational patterns was analyzed by 
      allele-specific ARMS RT-PCR to detect paternally inherited mutations. In 
      comparison with conventional PCR, 11 cases (84.6%) were matched successfully, 
      while two cases (15.4%) had no concordance with conventional invasive prenatal 
      testing (IPT). CONCLUSION: NIPT using maternal cf-DNA by allele-specific ARMS 
      RT-PCR can be feasible to screen paternal inherited mutant alleles to rule out 
      pregnant women from invasive procedures where the test would be negative for 
      paternal inheritance. However, a low amount of fetal DNA in maternal plasma is a 
      limiting factor and required further improvement to enrich fetal cf-DNA for 
      complete concordance with conventional IPT.

TI  - Flood risk public perception in flash flood-prone areas of Punjab, Pakistan.
PG  - 53691-53703
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-19646-5 [doi]
AB  - Floods due to higher severity of destruction are considered the most destructive 
      natural hazards in the world. Initiating the appropriate strategies of disaster 
      risk reduction is necessary to understand risk perception. This study attempted 
      to examine the flood risk public perception in flash flood-prone areas of Punjab, 
      Pakistan. A simple random sampling technique was used for collecting the data of 
      560 household respondents, and a logistic regression model was employed to make 
      out the factors of flood risk perception. In classification of low and high 
      perceived risk of relevant indicators, flood risk perception index was 
      constructed. Risk perception is significantly influenced by socioeconomic factors 
      which have a direct impact on disaster preparedness and potential adaptive 
      capacities. After that, potential correlation of risk perception with the 
      demographic status of respondents was investigated in this study. Empirical 
      estimates indicated as respondents' schooling, ownership of house, size of 
      household, employment status and past flood experience significantly influence 
      flood risk perception. Risk perception determinants also diverse among both 
      communities portray spatial differences. Inadequate protection measures from 
      public authorities and institutions, limited preparedness regarding actions of 
      private mitigation, reduced intensity of reliance in institutions and authorities 
      are major reasons for high risk and lower mitigation in these flash flood-prone 
      areas. The outcomes of this research can facilitate to understand flood risk 
      perception and its factors for conniving appropriate management plan of flood 
      risk and communication strategies. Furthermore, this research can help consider 
      multidimensional flood risks and its spatial vibrancy from the perspective of 
      social science.

AB  - The application of floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) is an innovative 
      nature-based solution for the remediation of polluted water. The rational 
      improvement of water treatment via FTWs is typically based on multifactorial 
      experiments which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Here, we used the 
      response surface methodology (RSM) for the optimization of FTW's operational 
      parameters for the remediation of water polluted by crude oil. The central 
      composite design (CCD) of RSM was used to generate the experimental layout for 
      testing the effect of the variables hydrocarbon, nutrient, and surfactant 
      concentrations, aeration, and retention time on the hydrocarbon removal in 50 
      different FTW test systems planted with the common reed, Phragmites australis. 
      The results from these FTW were used to formulate a mathematical model in which 
      the computational data strongly correlated with the experimental results. The 
      operational parameters were further optimized via modeling prediction plus 
      experimental validation in test FTW systems. In the FTW with optimized 
      parameters, there was a 95% attenuation of the hydrocarbon concentration, which 
      was very close to the 98% attenuation predicted by the model. The 
      cost-effectiveness ratio showed a reduction of the treatment cost up to 
      $0.048/liter of wastewater. The approach showed that RSM is a useful strategy for 
      designing FTW experiments and optimizing operational parameters.

TI  - Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: A Complex Disease with a Genetics Approach.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10030540 [doi]
LID - 540
AB  - Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine disorder affecting 
      females in their reproductive age. The early diagnosis of PCOS is complicated and 
      complex due to overlapping symptoms of this disease. The most accepted diagnostic 
      approach today is the Rotterdam Consensus (2003), which supports the positive 
      diagnosis of PCOS when patients present two out of the following three symptoms: 
      biochemical and clinical signs of hyperandrogenism, oligo, and anovulation, also 
      polycystic ovarian morphology on sonography. Genetic variance, epigenetic 
      changes, and disturbed lifestyle lead to the development of pathophysiological 
      disturbances, which include hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance, and chronic 
      inflammation in PCOS females. At the molecular level, different proteins and 
      molecular and signaling pathways are involved in disease progression, which leads 
      to the failure of a single genetic diagnostic approach. The genetic approach to 
      elucidate the mechanism of pathogenesis of PCOS was recently developed, whereby 
      four phenotypic variances of PCOS categorize PCOS patients into classic, 
      ovulatory, and non-hyperandrogenic types. Genetic studies help to identify the 
      root cause for the development of this PCOS. PCOS genetic inheritance is 
      autosomal dominant but the latest investigations revealed it as a multigene 
      origin disease. Different genetic loci and specific genes have been identified so 
      far as being associated with this disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) 
      and related genetic studies have changed the scenario for the diagnosis and 
      treatment of this reproductive and metabolic condition known as PCOS. This review 
      article briefly discusses different genes associated directly or indirectly with 
      disease development and progression.

TI  - Screening the Significant Hub Genes by Comparing Tumor Cells, Normoxic and 
      Hypoxic Glioblastoma Stem-like Cell Lines Using Co-Expression Analysis in 
      Glioblastoma.
LID - 10.3390/genes13030518 [doi]
LID - 518
AB  - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is categorized by rapid malignant cellular growth 
      in the central nervous system (CNS) tumors. It is one of the most prevailing 
      primary brain tumors, particularly in human male adults. Even though the 
      combination therapy comprises surgery, chemotherapy, and adjuvant therapies, the 
      survival rate is on average 14.6 months. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) have key roles 
      in tumorigenesis, progression, and counteracting chemotherapy and radiotherapy. 
      In our study, firstly, the gene expression dataset GSE45117 was retrieved and 
      differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were spotted. The co-expression network 
      analysis was employed on DEGs to find the significant modules. The most 
      significant module resulting from co-expression analysis was the turquoise 
      module. The turquoise module related to the tumor cells, hypoxia, normoxic 
      treatments of glioblastoma tumor (GBT), and GSCs were screened. Sixty-one common 
      genes in the turquoise module were selected generated through the co-expression 
      analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Moreover, the GO and KEGG 
      pathway enrichment results were studied. Twenty common hub genes were screened by 
      the NetworkAnalyst web instrument constructed on the PPI network through the 
      STRING database. After survival analysis via the Kaplan-Meier (KM) plotter from 
      The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we identified the five most significant 
      hub genes strongly related to the progression of GBM. We further observed these 
      five most significant hub genes also up-regulated in another GBM gene expression 
      dataset. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the turquoise module 
      genes was constructed and a KEGG pathway enrichments study of the turquoise 
      module genes was performed. The VEGF signaling pathway was emphasized because of 
      the strong link with GBM. A gene-disease association network was further 
      constructed to demonstrate the information of the progression of GBM and other 
      related brain neoplasms. All hub genes assessed through this study would be 
      potential markers for the prognosis and diagnosis of GBM.

TI  - Rosinidin Flavonoid Ameliorates Hyperglycemia, Lipid Pathways and Proinflammatory 
      Cytokines in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14030547 [doi]
LID - 547
AB  - Diabetes is one of the world's most important public health issues, impacting 
      both public health and socioeconomic advancement; moreover, current 
      pharmacotherapy is still insufficient. The natural flavonoid rosinidin has a long 
      history of use in pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements, but its role in 
      diabetes has been unknown. The current study was intended to confirm the 
      anti-diabetic activity of rosinidin in our laboratory setting, along with its 
      mechanism. Streptozotocin (60 mg/kg, ip) treatment used to induce type II 
      diabetes in rats and the test medication rosinidin was then administered orally 
      (at doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) for biochemical and histopathological 
      analysis. Treatment with rosinidin reduced negative consequences of diabetes. 
      Rosinidin exerted a protective effect on a number of characteristics, including 
      anti-diabetic responses (lower blood glucose, higher serum insulin and improved 
      pancreatic function) and molecular mechanisms (favorable effects on lipid 
      profiles, total protein, albumin, liver glycogen, proinflammatory cytokine, 
      antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, AST, ALT and urea). Furthermore, the 
      improved pancreatic architecture observed in tissues substantiated the favourable 
      actions of rosinidin in STZ-induced diabetic rats.

TI  - Beta-thalassemia and the advent of new interventions beyond transfusion and iron 
      chelation.

AB  - Beta-thalassaemia, including sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia E, is most 
      common in developing countries in tropical and subtropic regions. Because 
      carriers have migrated there owing to demographic migration, beta-thalassaemia can 
      now be detected in areas other than malaria-endemic areas. Every year, an 
      estimated 300 000-500 000 infants, the vast majority of whom are from developing 
      countries, are born with a severe haemoglobin anomaly. Currently, some basic 
      techniques, which include iron chelation therapy, hydroxyurea, blood transfusion, 
      splenectomy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, are being used to 
      manage thalassaemia patients. Despite being the backbone of treatment, 
      traditional techniques have several drawbacks and limitations. Ineffective 
      erythropoiesis, correction of globin chain imbalance and adjustment of iron 
      metabolism are some of the innovative treatment methods that have been developed 
      in the care of thalassaemia patients in recent years. Moreover, regulating the 
      expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia 11A and sex-determining region Y-box 
      through the enhanced expression of micro RNAs can also be considered putative 
      targets for managing haemoglobinopathies. This review focuses on the biological 
      basis of beta-globin gene production, the pathophysiology of beta-thalassaemia and the 
      treatment options that have recently been introduced.

TI  - Formulation of Piperine Nanoparticles: In Vitro Breast Cancer Cell Line and In 
      Vivo Evaluation.
LID - 10.3390/polym14071349 [doi]
LID - 1349
AB  - Piperine (PPN), one of the most investigated phytochemicals, is known to have 
      excellent therapeutic efficacy against a variety of ailments including breast 
      cancer. However, its physicochemical properties such as poor aqueous solubility 
      restrict its clinical application. Therefore, the present investigation was 
      designed to develop PPN encapsulated lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles 
      (PPN-LPHNPs) to overcome the limitation. The developed PPN-LPHNPs were optimized 
      by the three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design (33-BBD). The optimized 
      PPN-LPHNPs were then evaluated for their drug release profile, cytotoxicity assay 
      against MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, and gastrointestinal stability as well as 
      colloidal stability. In addition, the optimized PPN-LPHNPs were evaluated for ex 
      vivo intestinal permeation and in vivo pharmacokinetic in albino Wistar rats. As 
      per the results, the optimized PPN-LPHNPs showed a small average particles size 
      of <160 nm with a low (<0.3) polydispersity index, and highly positive surface 
      charge (>+20 mV). PPN-LPHNPs revealed excellent gastrointestinal as well as 
      colloidal stability and sustained release profiles up to 24 h. Furthermore, 
      PPN-LPHNPs revealed excellent cytotoxicity against both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 
      cancer cells compared to the free PPN. Moreover, animal studies revealed that the 
      PPN-LPHNPs exhibited a 6.02- and 4.55-fold higher intestinal permeation and 
      relative oral bioavailability, respectively, in comparison to the conventional 
      PPN suspension. Thus, our developed LPHNPs present a strong potential for 
      improved delivery of PPN.

TI  - Ligand substituent effect on the cytotoxicity activity of two new copper(ii) 
      complexes bearing 8-hydroxyquinoline derivatives: validated by MTT assay and 
      apoptosis in MCF-7 cancer cell line (human breast cancer).
PG  - 14362-14373
LID - 10.1039/d1ra00172h [doi]
AB  - In this study, we have examined the effect of ligand substituent on the 
      structure-cytotoxicity relationships of the MCF-7 cancer cell line (human breast 
      cancer), by two copper(ii) complexes [Cu(qmbn)(Hqmba)(q)].NO(3).2H(2)O (1) and 
      [Cu(Hqmba)(2)(q)].NO(3).2H(2)O (2) (where, qmbn = 2-(quinolin-8-yloxy)(methyl) 
      benzonitrile (L1); Hqmba = 2-((quinolin-8-yloxy)methyl)benzoic acid (L2) and q = 
      quinolin-8-olate). The structural analysis reveals that both the complexes 
      exhibit distorted octahedral (CuN(3)O(3)) configuration which is further 
      corroborated by density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The cytotoxicity 
      impact of ligands (L1 and L2) and complexes (1 and 2) was screened against the 
      MCF-7 cell line (human breast cancer). The MTT assay uptake indicated that the 
      presence of -COOH functionality in complex 2 leads to higher cytotoxicity (lower 
      IC(50)) than that observed for complex 1 containing a -CN group. This could be 
      due to the strong H-bonding forming propensity of the carboxylic acids. 
      Incubation of MCF-7 cancer cells with IC(50) concentrations of 1 and 2 promoted 
      cellular detachments via nuclear condensation and membrane destabilization 
      followed by apoptosis as a result of metal-assisted generation of reactive oxygen 
      species. Flow cytometry analysis showed that 1 and 2 might prompt early apoptosis 
      in MCF-7 cells as the maximum percentage of cells appeared in the LR quadrant. 
      Furthermore, mRNA expression analysis confirmed that both the complexes induced 
      apoptosis in MCF-7 cells. Comparative mRNA expression analysis of complexes with 
      their respective ligands also confirmed the enhanced apoptotic behavior of 
      complexes. Furthermore, molecular docking studies of the complexes have also been 
      performed with the active site of EGFR kinase receptors (major target for any 
      cancer causing agent) due to similar analogues with FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors 
      in order to rationalize its promising cytotoxicity activity.

TI  - Formulation and Evaluation of Apigenin-Loaded Hybrid Nanoparticles.
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14040783 [doi]
LID - 783
AB  - Apigenin (AGN) is a potent phytochemical with strong antioxidant and anticancer 
      potential. But its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to its high lipophilic 
      characteristics. Therefore, the present investigation aimed to develop AGN-loaded 
      polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (AGN-PLHNPs). Herein, we successfully 
      developed AGN-PLHNPs and optimized them by a 33-Box-Behnken de-sign. The poly 
      (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA; coded as F1), phospholipon 90 G (PL-90G; coded 
      as F2), and poloxamer 188 (P-188; coded as F3) were considered as the independent 
      factors while particle size (PS; coded as R1), entrapment efficiency (%EE; R2), 
      and cumulative drug release (%CDR; R3) were selected as dependent responses. The 
      average PS, %EE, and %CDR of the AGN-PLHNPs were observed in the range of 101.93 
      nm to 175.26 nm, 58.35% to 81.14%, and 71.21% to 93.31%, respectively. The 
      optimized AGN-PLHNPs revealed better homogeneity (poly-dispersity index < 0.2) 
      and colloidal stability with high zeta potential (>25 mV). It also exhibited fast 
      release in the initial 4 h after that sustained release up to 48 h of study. 
      Moreover, the results of both DPPH as well as ABTS assays revealed significant 
      improvement in the antioxidant activity. Furthermore, the optimized AGN-PLHNPs 
      exhibited enhanced cytotoxicity efficacy against MCF-7 as well as MDA-MB-231 
      breast cancer cell lines.

TI  - Synchronized agricultural credit and diversification adoption to catastrophic 
      risk manage for wheat production in Punjab, Pakistan.

AB  - In developing countries, particularly in agrarian economies like Pakistan, 
      agricultural production is severely affected by successive incidences of adverse 
      catastrophic risks. Inadequate and limited risk management measures from farming 
      community to overcome such severe financial, production, and marketing risks not 
      enough so need of adoption farm-based feasible risk management strategies. In 
      addressing this research gap, this study investigated the potential association 
      and implementing synchronized agricultural credit and diversification adoption to 
      catastrophic risk manage for wheat production in Punjab, Pakistan. The study used 
      the data of 480 wheat farmers' respondents and employed multinomial and bivariate 
      probit regression models for empirical analysis. Empirical estimates illustrated 
      the significant association in adoption of multiple risk management strategies as 
      addressing the adoption single risk management strategy motivates farmers to 
      adopt another strategy at same time. Furthermore, results also indicated as 
      farmer schooling, age, family return, ownership of land, farm size, and farmer 
      risk oppose character were highlighted the most influenced features for adopting 
      various risk management strategies. Policy makers and state-based authorities can 
      be assisted by these outcomes to evaluating plans of risk management and 
      willingness of farmer in accept government supported regarding implementation of 
      these catastrophic risk managing strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plasma 
      of 2, 4, 6-Trinitrotoluene (TNT) exposed ordnance factory workers. METHODS: A 
      case control study was conducted at the Department of Toxicology, Armed Forces 
      Institute of Pathology, Rawalpindi from July to December 2020. A total 30 
      subjects were recruited from an ordnance factory that were directly exposed to 
      TNT and 120 non-exposed individuals from non-factory healthy population. Plasma 
      levels of five miRNAs including miRNA-let-7a-2, miRNA-34a-1, miRNA-21-2, 
      miRNA-106b-1, miRNA-122a-1 were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Micro RNAs showed a wide range of Ct (cycle 
      threshold) values ranging from 23.48 to 41.94. Among the five miRNAs let-7a-2 and 
      miRNA-122a-1 displayed relatively high expression with Ct values ranging from 
      26.58 +/- 2.25 to 27.18 +/- 0.80 respectively. Relative fold change expression for 
      all five miRNAs of exposed individuals were found high (p <0.0001) vs 
      non-exposed. Dividing fold change expression of exposed individuals into two 
      groups as </= 10 and > 10, the individuals having </= 10-fold change expression 
      were19 (63.3%) in miRNA-let-7a-2, 30 (100%) in miRNA-34a-1 and 23 (76.7%) in 
      miRNA-122a-1 while in miRNA-21-2 and miR-106b-1, 23 (76.7%) and 18(60%) 
      individuals had > 10-fold change expression respectively. Among the five miRNAs 
      in exposed individuals, miRNA-let-7a-2, miR-21-2, miR-106b-1 and miR-122a-1 were 
      found highly expressed with fold change expression > 10 (p <0.0001). No 
      significant association was found between miRNAs expression levels with age and 
      working duration. CONCLUSION: The study shows upregulation of all five miRNAs in 
      TNT exposed subjects with no significant association of expression levels with 
      age and working duration.

AB  - Wild medicinal herbs have been used as folk and traditional medicines all across 
      the world since well before recorded history. This present study was designed to 
      test the antimicrobial activities of five different solvent extracted samples 
      (n-hexane, n-butanol, ethyl acetate, methanol, and water) of Peganum harmala 
      using stems and seeds. Two different strains of Gram-negative bacteria 
      (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia), two Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus 
      subtilus and Staphylococcus aureus), and one fungal strain (Candida albicans) 
      were used. The antimicrobial activities were measured using a disc diffusion 
      assay. Two concentrations of the extracts (1 and 2mgDisc-1) were used. Ethyl 
      acetate fraction was found more affective among the tested solvents and showed 
      maximum activity (zone of inhibition) against S. aureus (65.53 and 81.10%), E. 
      coli (46.22 and 61.29%) while n-butanol and water fractions gave maximum activity 
      against S. aureus (78.86 and 70.00%) and K. pneumonia (57.00 and 61.39%) 
      respectively. Water fraction showed maximum activity against C. albicans (60.00 
      and 81.88%). In the case of the stem, Ethyl acetate again showed more activity 
      against B. subtilus (38.57 and 42.10%) and S. aureus (36.66 and 46.66%) while 
      n-butanol showed maximum activity against K. pneumonia (24.55 and 32.44%) and E. 
      coli (27.93 and 37.61%). Methanol was found more effective against C. albicans 
      (25.71 and 43.80%). Seed extracted samples were found more effective compared to 
      the stem. Ethyl acetate, butanol, and aqueous extracted samples showed good 
      activity against the tested microbes, so these fractions are recommended for 
      study their mechanism of actions and isolation of bioactive metabolites 
      responsible for antimicrobial activities. The P. harmala should be evaluated for 
      their bioactive compounds to be used in future studies. Our objective is to 
      provide the framework for future study on the roles of P. harmala as traditional 
      medicines.

TI  - A fluorescent Cu(ii) complex as a dual functional sensor for selective and

PG  - 42137-42146
LID - 10.1039/d0ra08073j [doi]
AB  - In this study, Cu(2+) perchlorate complexes of 3,5-dimetylpyrazole(dmpy), namely 
      [Cu(dmpy)(3)(H(2)O)(2)](H(2)O)(ClO(4))(2) (1), were prepared and characterized by 
      X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), infrared (IR) 
      spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectrometry, and ultraviolet visible 
      (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. It was determined that Cu(2+) coordinated to the nitrogen 
      atoms of three dmpy molecules as well as to the oxygen atoms of two H(2)O 
      molecules in a square pyramidal geometry. To balance the charge, two 
      uncoordinated perchlorate anions and one H(2)O molecule were also present in the 
      lattice. The resulting Cu(2+) complex was involved in extensive hydrogen bonding, 
      which stabilized the structure. The fluorescence properties of complex 1 were 
      studied in acetonitrile at room temperature upon the addition of different 
      organic solvents. It was confirmed that the complex exhibited remarkable acetone 
      selectivity via a fluorescence quenching mechanism. At low concentrations, the 
      fluorescence intensities were nearly completely quenched via a turn-off mode. 
      Moreover, complex 1 displayed exceptional selectivity, fast detection time, and 
      high sensitivity for Cd(2+) in aqueous solutions via a fluorescence enhancement 
      mechanism (turn-on mode). Hence, the prepared complex showed potential for 
      application in Cd(2+) detection. Notably, in an aqueous solution, complex 1

      respect to Cd(2+) and was not affected by the interference of other metal ions.

TI  - Microparticle self-assembly induced by travelling surface acoustic waves.
PG  - 7916-7921
LID - 10.1039/c8ra09859j [doi]
AB  - We present an acoustofluidic method based on travelling surface acoustic waves 
      (TSAWs) to induce self-assembly of microparticles inside a microfluidic channel. 
      The particles are trapped above an interdigitated transducer, placed directly 
      beneath the microchannel, by the TSAW-based direct acoustic radiation force 
      (ARF). This approach was applied to trap 10 mum polystyrene particles, which were 
      pushed towards the ceiling of the microchannel by 72 MHz TSAWs to form single- 
      and multiple-layer colloidal structures. The repair of cracks and defects within 
      the crystal lattice occurs as part of the self-assembly process. The sample flow 
      through the first inlet can be switched with a buffer flow through the second 
      inlet to control the number of particles assembled in the crystalline structure. 
      The constant flow-induced Stokes drag force on the particles is balanced by the 
      opposing TSAW-based ARF. This force balance is essential for the acoustics-based 
      self-assembly of microparticles inside the microchannel. Moreover, we studied the 
      effects of varying input voltage and fluid flow rate on the position and shape of 
      the colloidal structure. The active self-assembly of microparticles into crystals 
      with multiple layers can be used in the bottom-up fabrication of colloidal 
      structures with dimensions greater than 500 mum x 500 mum, which is expected to 
      have important applications in various fields.

TI  - Impact of highly phospholipid-containing lipid nanocarriers on oral 
      bioavailability and pharmacodynamics performance of genistein.
PG  - 435-447
LID - 10.1080/10837450.2022.2076111 [doi]
AB  - Oxidative stress is a leading cause of different diseases. Genistein is a 
      valuable bioflavonoid possessing antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity but 
      unfortunately, it suffers from low aqueous solubility, extremely poor 
      bioavailability and first pass effect when used in its pure state. The aim of 
      this work was to formulate and characterize genistein-loaded highly 
      phospholipid-containing lipid nanocarriers to improve oral bioavailability and 
      pharmacodynamic performance. Lipid nanocarriers were prepared by the 
      emulsification/sonication technique. The influence of phospholipid percentage 
      (1%-10%) on physicochemical properties, drug release and stability was 
      investigated. The particle size, zeta potential and EE% were in ranges from 
      211.9 +/- 21.6 to 342.3 +/- 7.9 nm, -11.6 +/- 1.7 to -19.4 +/- 3.1 mV and 78.5 +/- 4.7% to 
      92.2 +/- 1.9%, respectively. Drug release was less predominant in the case of SLN 
      formulations when compared to corresponding NLC formulations. High phospholipid 
      percentage produced less stable formulations in terms of particle size growth, 
      gelation and heterogeneous particle distributions. DSC, FT-IR and XRD tools 
      revealed that genistein has existed in an amorphous form in NLC4. The 
      bioavailability of NLC4 was approximately 2.6-fold greater than that of 
      conventional suspension. Additionally, lipid peroxidation in liver homogenate and 
      histopathological alterations in liver and kidney sections were particularly 
      improved, providing a promising strategy for oral administration of genistein.

TI  - Termite diversity and damage assessment in urban trees from different parks of 
      Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan.
PG  - 72480-72492
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20899-3 [doi]
AB  - Termite infestation is one of the fundamental problems associated with the loss 
      of urban trees and ecological services. However, no such study has been performed 
      in Pakistan to investigate the termite occurrence and assess such damages to 
      urban trees caused by termites. For Lahore, research and comparable data on urban 
      tree damages are rare or missing. This study surveyed six different 
      microhabitats, including Bagh-e-Jinnah, canal vegetation, Model Town Park, Jallo 
      Forestry, Race-Course Park, and FC College Vegetation employing the three belt 
      transects (100 x 5 m) method. We geo-referenced termite-infested trees to 
      investigate the termite occurrence on living and dead standing trees, termite 
      diversity, and the assessment of tree damage by termites' attack. We recorded 
      four termite species (Odontotermes obesus Rambur, Coptotermes heimi Wasmann, 
      Heterotermes indicola Wasmann, and Microtermes obesi Holmgren) representing two 
      families (Rhinotermitidae and Termitidae). However, the diversity indices 
      revealed that O. obesus (higher termite) and C. heimi (lower termite) were 
      dominant with 46.60 and 36% of occurrence among observed trees, respectively. 
      Kernel density function indicated that the Lahore Canal and Bagh-e-Jinnah 
      plantation shared all four termites' infestation evenly compared to other study 
      sites. We observed the maximum number of damaged trees by termites in canal 
      vegetation with the most damaged exotic tree species Populus euramericana along 
      the canal green belt. Additionally, we observed significant (P < 0.05) 
      termite-tree interactions with exotic, living, and dead standing tree species and 
      found termite colony size positively (R = 0.985) correlated with the tree trunk 
      diameter up to breast height (DBH). The average population of termites per unit 
      volume of deadwood log was (0.39/cm(3)) within all plantation sites. In 
      conclusion, this study provides simple, reckless, and inexpensive knowledge about 
      the assessment of termite damage to trees, which may give a better idea in making 
      decisions on tree selection and management in urban ecosystems.

TI  - Antidepressant-like Effects of Renin Inhibitor Aliskiren in an Inflammatory Mouse 
      Model of Depression.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci12050655 [doi]
LID - 655
AB  - Depression is considered a neuropsychic disease that has global prevalence and is 
      associated with disability. The pathophysiology of depression is not well 
      understood; however, emerging evidence has indicated that neuroinflammation could 
      contribute to developing depression symptoms. One of the factors that have a role 
      in the development of neuroinflammation is the renin-angiotensin system. 
      Therefore, the goal of the current study is to determine the antidepressant-like 
      effects of Aliskiren, a renin inhibitor, against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced 
      depressive-like behavior in mice, glial cell activation, and the upregulation of 
      proinflammatory cytokines in the prefrontal cortex. For behavioral studies, the 
      open field test (OFT), tail suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST), and 
      sucrose preference test (SPT) were used. Inflammatory markers were assessed using 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). LPS administration (0.5 mg/kg, 
      intraperitoneal injection (i.p.)) sufficiently reduced the number of crossings in 
      OFT, whereas Aliskiren pretreatment (10 mg/kg, i.p.) attenuated the LPS effect 
      for two hours after LPS injection. The treatments did not show effects on 
      locomotor activity in OFT 24 h after LPS administration. LPS increased the 
      immobility time in TST and FST or reduced sucrose consumption in SPT after 24 h. 
      Aliskiren reversed the effects induced by LPS in TST, FST, and SPT. CD11 b mRNA, 
      a microglial marker, GFAP mRNA, an astroglial marker, and proinflammatory 
      cytokines genes (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) were upregulated in the prefrontal 
      cortex in LPS exposed animals. However, Aliskiren reduced LPS-induced 
      inflammatory genes in the prefrontal cortex. Hence, the outcomes conclude that 
      Aliskiren prevents depressive illness associated with neuroinflammation in 
      humans.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of phytochemicals from ethyl acetate fraction of 
      Solanum nigrum using GC-MS.
PG  - 547-552
AB  - Solanum nigrum plant has rich therapeutic potential and different developed 
      countries utilize this plant as a chief element for oriental medicinal practice 
      including cancer therapy. The current study determines the isolation and 
      purification of S. nigrum bioactive constituents through column chromatography 
      from ethyl acetate extract of the plant followed by the Gas Chromatography-Mass 
      Spectroscopy (GC-MS) to analyze the isolated compounds Different gradient 
      elutions followed by thin layer chromatography of collected fractions were done 
      and structural analysis of the isolated compounds was performed following GCMS 
      analysis, More specifically the compounds were identified as 1, 2 benzene 
      dicarboxylic acid, diisooctyl ester (95%) and as Bis (2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate 
      (84%) along with 3 hydroxy 4 carboxy 2 methyl 6 pyridine (58%) with reference to 
      chemical abstract service which may be responsible for its pharmacological 
      properties. According to the best information available, no documented 
      information exists regarding GC-MS based identification of the isolated chemical

TI  - Biodegradation and Subsequent Toxicity Reduction of Co-contaminants Tribenuron 
      Methyl and Metsulfuron Methyl by a Bacterial Consortium B2R.
PG  - 19816-19827
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01583 [doi]
AB  - AllyMax is a widely used herbicide formulation in wheat-rice cropping areas of 
      the world. The residues of its active ingredients, tribenuron methyl (TBM) and 
      metsulfuron methyl (MET), persist in soil and water as co-contaminants, and cause 
      serious threats to nontarget organisms. This study was performed to assess the 
      potential of a bacterial consortium for the degradation and detoxification of TBM 
      and MET individually and as co-contaminants. A bacterial consortium (B2R), 
      comprising Bacillus cereus SU-1, Bacillus velezensis OS-2, and Rhodococcus 
      rhodochrous AQ1, capable of degrading TBM and MET in liquid cultures was 
      developed. Biodegradation of TBM and MET was optimized using the Taguchi design 
      of experiment. Optimum degradation of both TBM and MET was obtained at pH 7 and 
      37  degrees C. Regarding media composition, optimum degradation of TBM and MET was 
      obtained in minimal salt medium (MSM) supplemented with glucose, and MSM without 
      glucose, respectively. The consortium simultaneously degraded TBM and MET (94.8 
      and 80.4%, respectively) in cultures containing the formulation AllyMax, where 
      TBM and MET existed as co-contaminants at 2.5 mg/L each. Mass spectrometry 
      analysis confirmed that during biodegradation, TBM and MET were metabolized into 
      simpler compounds. Onion (Allium cepa) root inhibition and Comet assays revealed 
      that the bacterial consortium B2R detoxified TBM and MET separately and as 
      co-contaminants. The consortium B2R can potentially be used for the remediation 
      of soil and water co-contaminated with TBM and MET.

      their degradation, present drugs, and possible PROTACs.
PG  - 612-636
LID - 10.1039/d0ra07971e [doi]
AB  - Alteration in the pattern of epigenetic marking leads to cancer, neurological 
      disorders, inflammatory problems etc. These changes are due to aberration in 
      histone modification enzymes that function as readers, writers and erasers. 
      Bromodomains (BDs) and BET proteins that recognize acetylation of chromatin 
      regulate gene expression. To block the function of any of these BrDs and/or BET 
      protein can be a controlling agent in disorders such as cancer. BrDs and BET 
      proteins are now emerging as targets for new therapeutic development. Traditional 
      drugs like enzyme inhibitors and protein-protein inhibitors have many 
      limitations. Recently Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have become an 
      advanced tool in therapeutic intervention as they remove disease causing 
      proteins. This review provides an overview of the development and mechanisms of 
      PROTACs for BRD and BET protein regulation in cancer and advanced possibilities 
      of genetic technologies in therapeutics.

TI  - Virulence Genes of Staphylococcus aureus Associated With Keratitis, 
      Conjunctivitis, and Contact Lens-Associated Inflammation.
PG  - 5
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.7.5 [doi]
LID - 5
AB  - PURPOSE: Staphylococcus aureus, cause a range of ocular diseases in humans, 
      including noninfectious corneal infiltrative events (niCIE), infectious 
      conjunctivitis and sight threatening microbial keratitis (MK). This study aimed 
      to determine the possession of known virulence genes of S. aureus associated with 
      MK and conjunctivitis, in strains isolated from these conditions and niCIE. 
      METHODS: Sixty-three S. aureus strains-23 from MK, 26 from conjunctivitis, and 14 
      from niCIE-were evaluated for possession of genes. Polymerase chain reaction was 
      used for the detection of mecA and 10 known virulence genes involved in MK (clfA, 
      fnbpA, eap, coa, scpA, sspB, sspA, hla, hld, and hlg), 2 associated with 
      conjunctivitis (pvl and seb). RESULTS: mecA was present in 35% of infections and 
      7% of niCIE strains (P = 0.05). It was not seen in infection strains from 
      Australia. Adhesion genes were found in all strains except clfA, which was found 
      in 75% of infection and 93% of niCIE strains. Invasion genes were found in higher 
      frequency in infections strains-hlg (100% vs. 85%; P = 0.04) and hld (94% vs. 
      50%; P = 0.005)-compared with niCIE strains. Evasion genes were common in 
      infection strains except scpA, which was found at a significantly higher 
      frequency in niCIE strains (86%) compared with infection strains (45%; P = 
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The higher rates of hlg and hld in strains isolated from 
      infections than niCIE may have a role in pathogenesis, whereas scpA may be an 
      important virulence factor during niCIEs. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This study has 
      identified virulence factors involved in the ocular pathogenesis of S. aureus 
      infections and niCIE.

TI  - Formation Mechanism and Lattice Parameter Investigation for Copper-Substituted 
      Cobalt Ferrites from Zingiber officinale and Elettaria cardamom Seed Extracts 
      Using Biogenic Route.
LID - 10.3390/ma15134374 [doi]
LID - 4374
AB  - Biogenic routes for the synthesis of nanoparticles are environmentally friendly, 
      nontoxic, biocompatible, and cost-effective compared to traditional synthesis 
      methods. In this study, cobalt ferrite was synthesized using Zingiber officinale 
      and Elettaria cardamom Seed extracts. Effect of copper contents (x = 0.0, 0.3, 
      0.6 and 0.9) on the plant extracted Cux(Co1-xFe2O4) was investigated by XRD, SEM, 
      EDX, UV-Vis., PL, FE-SEM, FTIR and photocatalytic activity. XRD results revealed 
      that nanoparticles exhibit a cubical spinel structure with an average diameter of 
      7-45 nm, calculated by the Debye Scherer formula. The value of the lattice 
      parameter decreased from 8.36 A to 8.08 A with substitution of copper, which can 
      be attributed to mismatch of ionic radii of Cu(2+) (0.73 A) and Co(2+) (0.74 A) 
      ions. SEM analysis showed that nanoparticles exhibit a spherical shape (~13 nm 
      diameter) for undoped samples and low Cu concentration, while they changed to a 
      hexagonal structure at higher Cu concentration (x = 0.9) with a diameter ~46 nm 
      and a decreased degree of agglomeration. FE-SEM further confirmed the 
      nanoparticles' size and shape. EDX analysis confirmed the presence of cobalt, 
      iron, and oxygen without contamination. The optical absorption spectra of UV-vis 
      and PL showed red-shift, which can be accredited to larger crystalline sizes of 
      nanoparticles. FTIR spectra showed two main bands at 410 and 605 cm(-1), 
      indicating the presence of intrinsic vibrations of the octahedral and tetrahedral 
      complexes, respectively. The photocatalytic activity of Co(0.4)Cu(0.6) Fe(2)O(4) 
      nanoparticles was investigated using methylene blue (MB) and methyl orange (MO) 
      dyes under visible light irradiation. The degradation rate (93.39% and 83.15%), 
      regression correlation coefficient (0.9868 and 0.9737) and rate constant (0.04286 
      and 0.03203 rate.min(-1)) were calculated for MB and MO, respectively. Mechanisms 
      for the formation and photocatalytic activity of Cu-substituted plant-extracted 
      cobalt ferrite were discussed. The Co(0.4)Cu(0.6) Fe(2)O(4) nanoferrite was found 
      to be an efficient photocatalyst, and can be exploited for wastewater treatment 
      applications for MB/MO elimination.

TI  - Flood hazards vulnerability and risk of food security in Bait community 
      flood-prone areas of Punjab Pakistan: In SDGs achievement threat.
PG  - 88663-88680
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21683-z [doi]
AB  - Climate change in the global perspective has increased the occurrence of natural 
      disasters, which subsequently decreased agricultural production and intensified 
      the issue of food security. Developing countries, such as Pakistan, are facing 
      severe food security issues, where most of the population still experiences 
      poverty and hunger in their daily lives. Flood disasters ruin valuable land, 
      cause agricultural production losses, and interrupt livelihood routines as 
      expected household livelihood becomes more vulnerable. This research work focused 
      on investigating the flood hazards vulnerability and risk of food security in the 
      Bait community flood-prone areas of Punjab, Pakistan, with a broader aspect in 
      contrast to previous research work. A constructed food security index composed of 
      several IPCC and FAO factors with correlated dimensions of food security was used 
      for the empirical estimation in this study. A composite food security index was 
      developed through polychoric principal component analysis. To estimate the 
      influence on the overall food security condition in the study area, a food 
      security index was regressed on various independent variables. Estimates of the 
      study indicated that three-fourths of household respondents in the study area are 
      confronted with the issue of food security with changeable scale. Financing 
      schemes, physical assets, and family type illustrated the positive influence on 
      respondents' food security level, whereas respondents suffering property losses 
      owing to floods had a negative influence. The study findings suggested integrated 
      strategies must be adopted to effectively deal with issues of food security in 
      the scenario of increasing severity of flood disasters. Policymakers and 
      disaster-concerned institutions need to develop disaster risk mitigation 
      strategies by constructing new water reserves and clearing river encroachments to 
      deal with flood disasters. Agricultural research and development authorities need 
      to provide climate friendly seed varieties and promote particular food crops for 
      flood prone areas to ensure food security and reduce livelihood vulnerability, 
      specifically for the flood-prone communities.

AB  - Lung injuries are attributed due to exposure to Drugs or chemicals. One of the 
      important challenging situations for the clinicians is to manage treatments of 
      different diseases with acute lung injury (ALI). The objective of this study was 
      to investigate the possible protective mechanisms and action of a novel 
      Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor "Apremilast" (AP) in lipopolysaccharide 
      (LPS)-induced lung injury. Blood sample from each animals were collected in a 
      vacuum blood collection tube. The rat lungs were isolated for oxidative stress 
      assessment, western blot analysis and their mRNA expressions using RT-PCR. 
      Exposure of LPS in rats causes significant increase in oxidative stress, 
      activates the pro-inflammatory cytokines release like tissue necrotic 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), modulated 
      gene expression, protein expression and histopathological changes which were 
      reversed by administration of AP. Finding of the research enlighten the 
      protective role of AP against LPS-induced ALI.

TI  - Protective Effect of Fustin Against Ethanol-Activated Gastric Ulcer via 
      Downregulation of Biochemical Parameters in Rats.
PG  - 23245-23254
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01341 [doi]
AB  - The fustin plant-derived bioflavonoid obtained from a common plant known as 
      lacquer tree from family Anacardiaceae, formally known as Rhus verniciflua 
      Stokes, is known to exert a variety of therapeutic properties. The current 
      investigation proved the anti-ulcerative property of fustin on ethanol-induced 
      gastric ulcers in an experimental animal model. The fustin 50 and 100 mg/kg was 
      studied in an experimental rat model by performing an 8 day protocol. The ulcer 
      index, pH, total acidic content, and biochemical parameters such as glutathione 
      (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase activity (CAT), malondialdehyde 
      (MDA), interleukin-1beta, prostaglandin E-2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 
      myeloperoxidase, and nitric oxide (NO) in serum were measured. The gastric 
      parameter such as ulcer index, pH, and acidic content was maintained in the 
      fustin groups compared to the ethanol control group. Clinical presentation of 
      gastric ulcers includes a significant increase in serum levels, GSH, SOD, and CAT 
      and decreased MDA, TNF-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and prostaglandin E-2 parameters in 
      contrast to normal groups. The treatment regimen with fustin has significantly 
      restored all serum parameters in test groups. The current study helps to develop 
      reasonable phytochemical options for the innervations of chemical-induced gastric 
      ulcers.

TI  - Construction of a 3D Metal-Organic Framework and Its Composite for Water 
      Remediation via Selective Adsorption and Photocatalytic Degradation of Hazardous 
      Dye.
PG  - 24438-24451
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01869 [doi]
AB  - In this work, a new bimetallic Na(I)-Zn(II) metal-organic framework (MOF), 
      formulated as [Na(2)Zn(3)(btc)(2)(mu-HCOO)(2)(mu-H(2)O)(8)] (n) (1) (H(3)btc = 
      benzene tricarboxylic acid), and its composite (ZnO@1) have been successfully 
      synthesized using solvothermal and mechanochemical solid grinding methods. 1 and 
      ZnO@1 were characterized by diffraction [single-crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) 
      and powder XRD], spectroscopic (ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance 
      spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), microscopic 
      (transmission electron microscopy), and thermal (thermogravimetric analysis) 
      methods. The surface area and porosity of 1 were determined using a 
      Brunauer-Emmett-Teller analyzer. Single-crystal diffraction of 1 confirms that 
      Na1 and Zn2 have octahedral coordination environments, whereas Zn1 has a 
      tetrahedral coordination geometry. Topological simplification of 1 shows a 
      3,6-connected kgd net. Na(I)-Zn(II) MOF (1) is crystallized with slight porosity 
      and exhibits good tendency toward the encapsulation of zinc oxide nanoparticles 
      (ZnO NPs). The photocatalytic behaviors of 1 and its composite (ZnO@1) were 
      investigated over MB dye under sunlight illumination with promising degradation 
      efficiencies of 93.69% for 1 and 97.53% for ZnO@1 in 80 min.

TI  - Antiamnesic Potential of Malvidin on Aluminum Chloride Activated by the Free 
      Radical Scavenging Property.
PG  - 24231-24240
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c01406 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Malvidin, a dietary anthocyanin can be a potent drug for the 
      treatment of neuronal toxicity. The investigation was aimed to study the 
      antioxidant role of malvidin against aluminum chloride (AlCl(3))-induced 
      neurotoxicity in rats. Methods: To evaluate the neuroprotective role of malvidin, 
      the rats were divided into four different groups: group I received saline, group 
      II received AlCl(3), and groups III and IV were administered with 100 and 200 
      mg/kg malvidin after AlCl(3) for 60 days. During the evaluation period, all the 
      groups were subjected to a behavioral test. On the 61st day of the study, rat 
      brains were removed and used for a neurochemical assay. Results: From the present 
      study, malvidin ameliorated the effects of AlCl(3) on behavioral parameters. 
      Biochemical investigation revealed that oral treatment of malvidin shows 
      neuroprotective effects through regulation of antioxidant levels and 
      neuroinflammation in the AlCl(3)-exposed rats. Conclusion: The results indicate 
      that malvidin possesses antioxidant activity via acetylcholinesterase inhibition 
      and regulation of oxidative stress in neuronal cells. Hence, malvidin could be a 
      potential drug in correcting Alzheimer's disease.

LID - 10.3390/ph15070899 [doi]
LID - 899
AB  - Severe infections such as viral, bacterial, or fungal sepsis can cause an 
      inflammatory response in the host, leading to organ failure and septic 
      shock-phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibiting related agents from suppressing 
      cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) degradation. Regulatory organisations have 
      approved some substances in this category to reduce the risk of chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in patients with chronic 
      bronchitis and a history of COPD exacerbations. Roflumilast has been shown to 
      alleviate inflammatory responses, thus regulating airway inflammation. 
      Additionally, roflumilast therapy dramatically enhanced B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) 
      expression, an anti-apoptotic marker lowered in septic animals. Previous research 
      has indicated that roflumilast may help reverse sepsis-induced liver and lung 
      harm, but whether it is also effective in reversing sepsis-induced renal 
      impairment remains unknown. Therefore, this review determines whether roflumilast 
      protects against renal dysfunction, inflammatory response, and apoptosis in 
      sepsis-induced kidney damage. Additionally, we discussed the molecular mechanism 
      through which roflumilast exerts its protective effect to uncover a possible 
      treatment agent for sepsis-induced renal impairment.

TI  - Cross-Serotype Reactivity of ELISAs Used to Detect Antibodies to the Structural 
      Proteins of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus.
LID - 10.3390/v14071495 [doi]
LID - 1495
AB  - Antibodies to the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) capsid induced by infection 
      or vaccination can provide serotype-specific protection and be measured using 
      virus neutralization tests and viral structural-protein (SP-)ELISAs. Separate 
      tests are needed for each serotype, but cross-serotype reactions complicate 
      serotyping. In this study, inter-serotypic responses were quantified for five 
      SP-ELISA formats by testing 294 monovalent mainly bovine sera collected following 
      infection, vaccination, or vaccination and infection with one of five serotypes 
      of FMDV. Over half of the samples, representing all three immunization 
      categories, scored positive for at least one heterologous serotype and some 
      scored positive for all serotypes tested. A comparative approach to identifying 
      the strongest reaction amongst serotypes O, A and Asia 1 improved the accuracy of 
      serotyping to 73-100% depending on the serotype and test system, but this method 
      will be undermined where animals have been infected and/or vaccinated with 
      multiple FMDV serotypes. Preliminary studies with stabilized recombinant capsid 
      antigens of serotypes O and A that do not expose internal epitopes showed reduced 
      cross-reactivity, supporting the hypothesis that capsid integrity can affect the 
      serotype-specificity of the SP-ELISAs. The residual cross-reactivity associated 
      with capsid surface epitopes was consistent with the evidence of cross-serotype 
      virus neutralization.

TI  - Anti-Huntington's Effect of Rosiridin via Oxidative Stress/AchE Inhibition and 
      Modulation of Succinate Dehydrogenase, Nitrite, and BDNF Levels against 
      3-Nitropropionic Acid in Rodents.
LID - 10.3390/biom12081023 [doi]
LID - 1023
AB  - Background: Rosiridin is a compound extracted from Rhodiola sachalinensis; water 
      extracts of Rhodiola root elicit positive effects on the human central nervous 
      system and improve brain function. They are also thought to be beneficial to 
      one's health, in addition to being antioxidants. The present study aims to 
      evaluate the anti-Huntington's effect of rosiridin against 3-nitropropionic acid 
      (3-NPA)-induced Huntington's disease (HD)-like effects in rats. Materials and 
      Methods: The acute toxicity in rats was elucidated to track the conceivable 
      toxicities in the rats. The effectiveness of rosiridin at a dosage of 10 mg/kg 
      was evaluated against several dose administrations of 3-NPA-induced HD-like 
      symptoms in the rats for 22 days. At the end of the study, behavioral parameters 
      were assessed as a hallmark for the cognitive and motor functions in the rats. 
      Similarly, after the behavioral assessment, the animals were sacrificed to obtain 
      a brain tissue homogenate. The prepared homogenate was utilized for the 
      estimation of several biochemical parameters, including oxidative stress 
      (glutathione, catalase, and malondialdehyde), brain-derived neurotrophic factor 
      and succinate dehydrogenase activity, and the glutamate and acetylcholinesterase 
      levels in the brain. Furthermore, inflammatory mediators linked to the occurrence 
      of neuroinflammation in rats were evaluated in the perfused brain tissues. 
      Results: The rosiridin-treated group exhibited a significant restoration of 
      behavioral parameters, including in the beam-walk test, latency in falling during 
      the hanging wire test, and percentage of memory retention during the elevated 
      plus-maze test. Further, rosiridin modulated several biochemical parameters, 
      including oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory activity, brain-derived neurotrophic 
      factor, nitrite, and acetylcholinesterase as compared to disease control group 
      that was treated with 3-NPA. Conclusions: The current study exhibits the 
      anti-Huntington's effects of rosiridin in experimental animal models.

LID - 993
AB  - Background and Objectives: To assess the antioxidant and neuroprotective role of 
      rosinidin on rat memory impairment that is induced by streptozotocin. Materials 
      and Methods: Wistar rats were given an intraperitoneal (i.p) injection of 
      streptozotocin (60 mg/kg) followed by treatment with rosinidin at selective doses 
      (10 and 20 mg/kg) for 30 days. The behavioral parameters were estimated by Y-maze 
      test and Morris water test. Biochemical parameters such as acetylcholinesterase 
      (AChE), choline aacetyltransferase (ChAT), and nitric oxide, and antioxidants 
      such as glutathione transferase (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) IL-6, IL-10, 
      Nrf2, and BDNF, were determined. Results: The study results revealed that 
      rosinidin improved cognition by reverting the behavioral parameters. The 
      treatment with rosinidin restored the antioxidant enzymes and inflammatory 
      cytokines. Conclusions: From the results, it has been proven that rosinidin 
      possesses antioxidant, anti-amnesic, and anti-inflammatory activity. Rosinidin 
      improved the cognitive and behavioral deficits that were induced by 
      streptozotocin. Furthermore, 20 mg/kg rosinidin was found to have strong 
      protective action against streptozotocin-induced toxicity.

AB  - Pain is a sensation a humans sense as a protective mechanism against physical 
      injury. This sensation is closely related to inflammation. It ranges from mild to 
      highly obnoxious. It is well-known that the levels of the inflammatory biomarker, 
      C-reactive protein (CRP), increase manifold in acute inflammation and pain. Olive 
      oil, known to have many phytochemicals, has been traditionally used to alleviate 
      pain. Amongst major phenolic compounds in olive oil are oleuropein (OLE), 
      hydroxytyrosol (HT), tyrosol, and oleocanthal. Whether the analgesic and 
      anti-inflammatory properties in olive oil are due to any specific interections is 
      not known. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the possible 
      anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive properties in those major phenolic 
      compounds by using molecular docking software MOE 2015, comparing the energy 
      value and binding site of phenolic compounds to that of well-known synthetic 
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and phosphocholine. The docking 
      experiment showed that all compounds could directly interact with CRP. Oleuropein 
      had the most potent interaction with CRP (-7.7580), followed by indomethacin 
      (-6.0775), oleocanthal (-5.5734), ibuprofen (-5.3857), phosphocholine (-4.3876), 
      HT (-4.2782), and tyrosol (-4.2329). Interestingly, the present study found other 
      phytochemicals in olive oil that can be exploited as potential, safe, and 
      cost-effective lead compound(s) for analgesic and anti-inflammatory activity, as 
      supported by its molecular docking data.

AB  - In this study we have provided forensic genetic data of 22 autosomal STRs for 
      Pakhtun, Balochi and Balti population of Pakistan in total of 601 samples. Among 
      these loci, Penta E was found the most discriminatory in all groups and allele 15 
      was observed most frequent at D22S1045 in Balti whereas in other two populations 
      allele 8 was more common at TPOX. The combined power of discrimination, combined 
      power of exclusion and the combined matching probability was calculated as 
      0.999999999999999999999999998385, 0.999999988089728 and 1.615 x 10(-27) 
      respectively. Based on population differentiation test, significant differences 
      were observed when compared with other populations however, phylogenetic analysis 
      revealed close genetic associations among Pakistani Populations.

AB  - LHPP gene encodes a phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate 
      phosphatase, which functions as a tumor-suppressor protein. The tumor suppression 
      by this protein has been confirmed in various cancers, including hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). LHPP downregulation promotes cell growth and proliferation by 
      modulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This study identifies potentially 
      deleterious missense single nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with the LHPP 
      gene using multiple computational tools based on different algorithms. A total of 
      4 destabilizing mutants are identified as L22P, I212T, G227R, and G236R, from the 
      conserved region of the phosphatase. The 3-dimensional (3D) modeling and 
      structural comparison of variants with the native protein reveals significant 
      structural and conformational variations after mutations, suggesting disruption 
      in the function of phospholysine phosphohistidine inorganic pyrophosphate 
      phosphatase. The identified mutations might, therefore, participate in the cause 
      of HCC.

TI  - Response Surface Methodology for Optimization of Operational Parameters To Remove 
      Ciprofloxacin from Contaminated Water in the Presence of a Bacterial Consortium.
PG  - 27450-27457
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.2c02448 [doi]
AB  - Ciprofloxacin (CFX) is a broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic that is widely 
      used to treat bacterial infections in humans and other animals. However, its 
      unwanted occurrence in any (eco)system can affect nontarget bacterial 
      communities, which may also impair the performance of the natural or artificially 
      established bioremediation system. The problem could be minimized by optimization 
      of operational parameters via modeling of multifactorial tests. To this end, we 
      used a Box-Behnken design in response surface methodology (RSM) to generate the 
      experimental layout for testing the effect of the CFX biodegradation for four 
      important parameters, that is, temperature ( degrees C), pH, inoculum size (v/v %), and 
      CFX concentration (mg L(-1)). For inoculation, a consortium of three bacterial 
      strains, namely, Acenitobacter lwofii ACRH76, Bacillus pumilus C2A1, and 
      Mesorihizobium sp. HN3 was used to degrade 26 mg L(-1) of CFX. We found maximum 
      degradation of CFX (98.97%; initial concentration of 25 mg L(-1)) at 2% inoculum 
      size, 7 pH, and 35  degrees C of temperature in 16 days. However, minimum degradation of 
      CFX (48%; initial concentration of 50 mg L(-1)) was found at pH 6, temperature 30 
       degrees C, and inoculum size 1%. Among different tested parameters, pH appears to be the 
      main limiting factor for CFX degradation. Independent factors attributed 89.37% 
      of variation toward CFX degradation as revealed by the value of the determination 
      coefficient, that is, R (2) = 0.8937. These results were used to formulate a 
      mathematical model in which the computational data strongly correlated with the 
      experimental results. This study showcases the importance of parameter 
      optimization via RSM for any bioremediation studies particularly for antibiotics 
      in an economical, harmless, and eco-friendly manner.

TI  - Genomics of Staphylococcus aureus Strains Isolated from Infectious and 
      Non-Infectious Ocular Conditions.
LID - 10.3390/antibiotics11081011 [doi]
LID - 1011
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of ocular infectious (corneal infection or 
      microbial keratitis (MK) and conjunctivitis) and non-infectious corneal 
      infiltrative events (niCIE). Despite the significant morbidity associated with 
      these conditions, there is very little data about specific virulence factors 
      associated with the pathogenicity of ocular isolates. A set of 25 S. aureus 
      infectious and niCIEs strains isolated from USA and Australia were selected for 
      whole genome sequencing. Sequence types and clonal complexes of S. aureus strains 
      were identified by using multi-locus sequence type (MLST). The presence or 
      absence of 128 virulence genes was determined by using the virulence finder 
      database (VFDB). Differences between infectious (MK + conjunctivitis) and niCIE 
      isolates from USA and Australia for possession of virulence genes were assessed 
      using the chi-square test. The most common sequence types found among ocular 
      isolates were ST5, ST8 while the clonal complexes were CC30 and CC1. Virulence 
      genes involved in adhesion (ebh, clfA, clfB, cna, sdrD, sdrE), immune evasion 
      (chp, esaD, esaE, esxB, esxC, esxD), and serine protease enzymes (splA, splD, 
      splE, splF) were more commonly observed in infectious strains (MK + 
      conjunctivitis) than niCIE strains (p = 0.004). Toxin genes were present in half 
      of infectious (49%, 25/51) and niCIE (51%, 26/51) strains. USA infectious 
      isolates were significantly more likely to possess splC, yent1, set9, set11, 
      set36, set38, set40, lukF-PV, and lukS-PV (p < 0.05) than Australian infectious 
      isolates. MK USA strains were more likely to possesses yent1, set9, set11 than 
      USA conjunctivitis strains (p = 0.04). Conversely USA conjunctivitis strains were 
      more likely to possess set36 set38, set40, lukF-PV, lukS-PV (p = 0.03) than MK 
      USA strains. The ocular strain set was then compared to 10 fully sequenced 
      non-ocular S. aureus strains to identify differences between ocular and 
      non-ocular isolates. Ocular isolates were significantly more likely to possess 
      cna (p = 0.03), icaR (p = 0.01), sea (p = 0.001), set16 (p = 0.01), and set19 (p 
      = 0.03). In contrast non-ocular isolates were more likely to possess icaD (p = 
      0.007), lukF-PV, lukS-PV (p = 0.01), selq (p = 0.01), set30 (p = 0.01), set32 (p 
      = 0.02), and set36 (p = 0.02). The clones ST5, ST8, CC30, and CC1 among ocular 
      isolates generally reflect circulating non-ocular pathogenic S. aureus strains. 
      The higher rates of genes in infectious and ocular isolates suggest a potential 
      role of these virulence factors in ocular diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. The 
      available drugs improve the symptoms but do not play role in modifying disease 
      effects. Currently, the treatment strategies focus on inhibiting the production 
      of Abeta-42 aggregates and tau filaments. In this context the natural plant products 
      could act as a potent candidate. Therefore, we decided to study the effect of 
      apigenin on the transgenic Drosophila model of AD i.e., expressing Abeta-42 in the 
      neurons. The AD flies were allowed to feed on the diet having 25, 50, 75 and 
      100 muM of apigenin for 30 days. The exposure of AD flies to apigenin showed a 
      dose dependent significant decrease in the oxidative stress and delay in the loss 
      of climbing ability. Apigenin also inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase. 
      The immunostaining and molecular docking studies suggest that apigenin inhibits 
      the formation of Abeta-42 aggregates. Apigenin is potent in reducing the AD symptoms 
      being mimicked in the transgenic Drosophila model of AD.

TI  - Enhancing drought stress tolerance in Camelina (Camelina sativa L.) through 
      exogenous application of potassium.
PG  - e13779
LID - 10.1111/ppl.13779 [doi]
AB  - The current study was performed under controlled conditions to study the effects 
      of exogenous potassium application on carotenoid contents and drought tolerance 
      in Camelina. Water deficit levels such as 100% FC (control) and 40% FC (drought 
      stress) were imposed after germination of Camelina plants grown to maturity, and 
      different treatments of exogenous K+ were applied at the vegetative stage. We 
      have reported 17 traits of plant growth, physiology, antioxidant enzyme activity, 
      focusing on carotenoids in Camelina to explore their potential yield and yield 
      components. For this purpose, we used multivariate analysis techniques 
      (descriptive statistics, correlation matrix, analysis of variance [ANOVA] and 
      principal components analysis [PCA] to determine the best relation between 
      potassium and studied traits). The results showed a large number of variations in 
      the studied trait under control and water deficit condition. Plant fresh weight 
      (g) was negatively correlated with shoot length and SOD insignificantly 
      correlated with plant fresh weight (g) under water deficit conditions. Potassium 
      loading predicted that foliar application (3 mM K(2) SO(4) ), foliar application 
      (6 mM KNO(3) ), foliar application (12 mM KNO(3) ) and foliar application (12 mM 
      K(2) SO(4) ) are the important doses that contribute the most to enhance the 
      growth, physiological and biochemical activities and carotenoids to improve the 
      Camelina yield under water deficit condition. These doses should be considered in 
      the future to improve the Camelina yield under semi-arid conditions with 
      increased genetic diversity (varietal selection).

      promise.

AB  - The association of protein kinase CK2 (formerly casein kinase II or 2) with cell 
      growth and proliferation in cells was apparent at early stages of its 
      investigation. A cancer-specific role for CK2 remained unclear until it was 
      determined that CK2 was also a potent suppressor of cell death (apoptosis); the 
      latter characteristic differentiated its function in normal versus malignant 
      cells because dysregulation of both cell growth and cell death is a universal 
      feature of cancer cells. Over time, it became evident that CK2 exerts its 
      influence on a diverse range of cell functions in normal as well as in 
      transformed cells. As such, CK2 and its substrates are localized in various 
      compartments of the cell. The dysregulation of CK2 is documented in a wide range 
      of malignancies; notably, by increased CK2 protein and activity levels with 
      relatively moderate change in its RNA abundance. High levels of CK2 are 
      associated with poor prognosis in multiple cancer types, and CK2 is a target for 
      active research and testing for cancer therapy. Aspects of CK2 cellular roles and 
      targeting in cancer are discussed in the present review, with focus on nuclear 
      and mitochondrial functions and prostate, breast and head and neck malignancies.

AB  - Omicron is one of the variants of COVID-19 and continuing member of a pandemic. 
      There are several types of vaccines that were developed around the globe to fight 
      against the virus. However, the world is suffering to find suitable drug 
      candidates for the virus. The main protease (M(pro)) enzyme of the virus is the 
      best target for finding drug molecules because of its involvement in viral 
      infection and protein synthesis. ZINC-15 is a database of 750 million 
      commercially available compounds. We find 125 compounds having two aromatic rings 
      and amide groups for non-covalent interactions with active site amino acids and 
      functional groups with the capability to bind -SH group of C145 of M(pro) through 
      covalent bonding by a nucleophilic addition reaction. The lead compound (Z144) 
      was identified using molecular docking. The non-covalent interactions (NCI) 
      calculations show the interactions between amino acids present in the active site 
      of the protein and the lead molecules are attractive in nature. The density 
      functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) study of the lead compound with amino acids 
      in the active site indicates that Q190 and Q193 play a very critical role in 
      stabilization. The Michael addition of the acrylamide group of the lead molecule 
      at beta-position is facile because the low energy lowest unoccupied molecular 
      orbital (LUMO) is concentrated on the group. From molecular dynamics during 100 
      ns, it has come to light that strong non-covalent interactions are key for the 
      stability of the lead inside the protein and such binding can fold the protein. 
      The free energy for this interaction is -42.72 kcal mol(-1) which was obtained 
      from MM-GB/SA calculations.

TI  - Rosiridin Attenuates Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive Impairments in Rats via 
      Inhibition of Oxidative and Nitrative Stress Leaded Caspase-3/9 and TNF-alpha 
      Signaling Pathways.

AB  - AIM: A monoterpene and bioactive component of the plant Rhodiola rosea (R. 
      rosea), rosiridin has beneficial effects on the human central nervous system and 
      enhances brain function. The goal of this scientific study was to determine if 
      rosiridin might shield rats from neurocognitive problems induced by scopolamine. 
      METHODS: To track the potential toxicities in rats, the acute toxicity in rats 
      was clarified. Rosiridin at a dose of 10 mg/kg was tested in rats for 14 days. At 
      the conclusion of the investigation, behavioral parameters that were used to 
      identify the rats' cognitive and motor abilities were evaluated. Several 
      biochemical parameters were estimated using the prepared homogenate, including 
      acetylcholine esterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), radical 
      scavengers produced by the body (Catalase-CAT, superoxide dismutase-SOD, and 
      reduced glutathione-GSH), indicators of oxidative and nitrative burnout, 
      pro-inflammatory (Interleukins- IL-1beta, IL-6, interferon gamma IFN-ꝩ, and tumor 
      necrosis factor-TNF-alpha), and cell apoptosis caspases 3 and 9. RESULTS AND 
      CONCLUSION: A significant behavioral parameter restoration was seen in the 
      rosiridin-treated group, including reduction in latency time during acquisition 
      and retention trial in the Morris water maze test, and percentage of spontaneous 
      alterations in the y-maze test, when compared to the disease control group that 
      received scopolamine; rosiridin also altered the oxidative stress and 
      neuroinflammatory markers, as well as restoring Ach and ChAT activities and 
      normalizing GSH, SOD, MDA, TNF-alpha, nitrate, IL-1beta, IL-6, IFN-ꝩ, caspases 3 and 9 
      levels. The results imply that rosiridin limits the effect of scopolamine on rat 
      cognitive function.

AB  - The worldwide increase of multi-drug resistance has directed the researchers to 
      focus on ecofriendly ways of nanoparticles synthesis with effective antivirulence 
      properties. Here, we report the antibiofilm and quorum quenching (QQ) potential 
      of zirconium oxide nanoparticles (ZrO(2) NPs) synthesized from aqueous ginger 
      extract against multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii. The results 
      indicated that ZrO(2) NPs were of tetragonal shape with average diameter of 
      16 nm. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal 
      concentration (MBC) values for A. baumannii were 15.6 and 62.5 microg/ml, 
      respectively, as revealed by broth microdilution assay. Exposure of bacterial 
      cells to ZrO(2) NPs resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation which in 
      turn led to cellular membrane disruption as observed by an increase in leakage of 
      cellular contents, such as proteins, sugars, and DNA. The antibiofilm activity 
      was evaluated by microtiter plate assay and the results revealed that the 
      percentage inhibition of biofilm was found to be 14.3-80.6%. ZrO(2) NPs also 
      obstructed the chemical composition of biofilms matrix by reducing the proteins 
      and carbohydrate contents. Molecular docking studies of ZrO(2) NPs with four 
      proteins (2NAZ, 4HKG, 5D6H, and 5HM6) involved in biofilm formation of A. 
      baumannii revealed the interaction of zirconium with target proteins. These 
      findings suggested the in vitro efficacy of phytosynthesized ZrO(2) NPs as 
      antibiofilm and QQ agents that can be exploited in the development of alternative 
      therapeutic options against MDR A. baumannii.

TI  - Direct sequencing of beta-globin gene reveals a rare combination of two exonic and 
      two intronic variants in a beta-thalassemia major patient: a case report.
PG  - 362
LID - 10.1186/s13256-022-03605-2 [doi]
LID - 362
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to indels in the beta-globin gene, patients with beta-thalassemia major 
      exhibit a range of severity, with genotype beta(0)beta(0) > beta(0)beta(+) > beta(+)beta(+), 
      according to the production level of the beta-globin chain. More than 300 mutations 
      have been identified in the beta-globin gene. CASE PRESENTATION: In this case study, 
      we report a compound heterozygous condition with a rare concoction of four 
      different variants (CD 3(T > C), CD41/42 (-CTTT), IVS II-16 (G > C), and IVS 
      II-666 (C > T) in a single beta-globin gene. A regular transfusion-dependent 
      4-year-old male patient from India was included in the study. Augmented direct 
      sequencing of the beta-globin gene helped reveal the presence of an unusual 
      combination of different variants in a single gene. This patient clinically 
      presented as beta-thalassemia major and was genotypically considered as beta(0)beta(+), 
      although CD41/42(-CTTT) was the only causative/pathogenic mutation in the disease 
      severity. CONCLUSION: Although CD41/42-(CTTT) is the only pathogenic variant 
      among the four variants, the clinical complications of such a combination of 
      variants (pathogenic and benign) is not well understood. Intronic mutations may 
      have the ability to modify clinical characteristics. The variants must therefore 
      be reclassified using additional mRNA splicing and expression-based studies. 
      Additionally, these types of combinations may have significance in studying 
      population migration around the world.

AB  - High-throughput sequencing technologies (HSTs) have revolutionized crop breeding. 
      The advent of these technologies has enabled the identification of beneficial 
      quantitative trait loci (QTL), genes, and alleles for crop improvement. Climate 
      change have made a significant effect on the global maize yield. To date, the 
      well-known omic approaches such as genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and 
      metabolomics are being incorporated in maize breeding studies. These approaches 
      have identified novel biological markers that are being utilized for maize 
      improvement against various abiotic stresses. This review discusses the current 
      information on the morpho-physiological and molecular mechanism of abiotic stress 
      tolerance in maize. The utilization of omics approaches to improve abiotic stress 
      tolerance in maize is highlighted. As compared to single approach, the 
      integration of multi-omics offers a great potential in addressing the challenges 
      of abiotic stresses of maize productivity.

TI  - Effects of the Anthocyanin Hirsutidin on Gastric Ulcers: Improved Healing through 
      Antioxidant Mechanisms.
PG  - 2406-2412
LID - 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.2c00620 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this study was to determine the effect of hirsutidin on 
      ethanol-induced stomach ulcers in rats. Rats (n = 24 rats/group) were separated 
      at random into the following groups: normal saline-treated (normal control), 
      ethanol-treated (ethanol control), 10 mg/kg hirsutidin + ethanol-treated 
      (hirsutidin 10), and 20 mg/kg hirsutidin + ethanol-treated (hirsutidin 20). All 
      the groups received the respective treatment orally for 7 days. On day 7, i.e., 
      after 24 h of fasting, except for the normal control group, all the groups orally 
      received 5 mL/kg of ethanol. Four hours later, rats were anaesthetized, serum was 
      isolated from the blood, and biochemical tests were performed. The stomach tissue 
      was utilized for ulcer grading, histology, and biochemical analysis. The rats 
      developed stomach acidity and ulcers after being given ethanol based on increased 
      ulcer score, disturbed cellular architecture, increased oxidative stress, 
      myeloperoxidase and decreased endogenous antioxidants, and nitric oxide and 
      prostaglandin E2 concentration. Ethanol-treated rats also displayed increased 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, 
      alkaline phosphatase, and inflammatory cytokines. The treatment with hirsutidin 
      protected and significantly restored all serum parameters in ethanol-induced 
      stomach ulcers and may have antiulcer activity.

AB  - In this work, we aimed to synthesize a new cobalt(II) complex, namely 
      [Co(2)(mu-HIPA)(NC)(2)(H(2)O)(3)(NO(3))].(NO(3))(C(2)H(5)OH)(1) (where 
      H(3)IPA = 5-hydroxy isophthalic acid and NC = 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline or 
      neocuproine), as a promising chemotherapeutic agent. The diffraction (single 
      crystal-XRD and powder-XRD), spectroscopic (FTIR and UV-visible), molar 
      conductance, and thermal techniques were used to characterize complex 1. 
      Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that Co(II) exists in an 
      octahedral geometry, with the ligation of four oxygen atoms, and two nitrogen 
      atoms. Topological analysis of complex 1 reveals 2,6C6 topological type as an 
      underlying net. The plausible intermolecular interactions within complex 1 that 
      control the crystal packing were analyzed by Hirshfeld surface analysis. In vitro 
      cytotoxicity of complex 1 was evaluated against acute myeloid leukemia (THP-1), 
      colorectal (SW480), and prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines by utilizing an MTT 
      assay. The result shows that complex 1 can inhibit the growth of cancer cells 
      (THP-1, SW480, and PC-3) at lower inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values 
      of > 100, 43.6, and 95.1 microM respectively. The morphological changes induced by 
      complex 1 on THP-1 and SW480 cancer cell lines were carried out with acridine 
      orange/ethidium bromide staining methods. Additionally, comprehensive molecular 
      docking studies were performed to understand the potential binding interactions 
      of complex 1 with different bio-macromolecules.

AB  - The current study aims to isolate, purify, and characterize the trypsin inhibitor 
      protein from seeds of soya beans, scientifically known as Glycine max. Its seeds 
      were ground, and the powder was soaked several times using n-hexane. It was added 
      to phosphate buffer saline (PBS) followed by filtration and centrifugation of the 
      PBS dissolved extract. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate 
      precipitation and about six fractions, 30% to 80% were prepared. The centrifuged 
      pellets obtained from each fraction were dialyzed and run on SDS-PAGE. The 
      trypsin inhibitor protein was precipitated and characterized in 30% pellet and 
      molecular weight was 21.5 kDa compared to protein ladder (ThermoFisher 
      10-170 kDa). GC-MS analysis revealed the steroid derivatives such as 
      stigmasterol, campesterol, beta-sitosterol, and gamma-tocopherol. Glycine max 
      trypsin inhibitor could be used as a plant-derived drug to overcome the 
      over-activation of trypsin without its real substrate (proteins) becoming 
      activated and start auto digestion leading to pancreatitis.

AB  - Fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is a 
      polyphagous insect pest of many important crops. To evaluate the influence of 
      host plants on the biology and survival of the Pakistani population of S. 
      frugiperda, we examined life table parameters of S. frugiperda raised on maize, 
      sorghum, wheat, and rice. The development rate was significantly higher on the 
      maize crop than on the other three host plants. Different larval diets affected 
      development time and fecundity. S. frugiperda attained the fastest larval 
      development (16 days) on maize and the slowest development (32.74 days) on rice. 
      Adult females from maize-fed larvae laid 1088 eggs/female, those from sorghum-fed 
      larvae laid 591.6 eggs/female, those from wheat-fed larvae laid 435.6 
      eggs/female, and those from rice-fed larvae laid 49.6 eggs/female. Age 
      stage-specific parameters also indicated the higher fecundity, higher life 
      expectancy, and higher survival of S. frugiperda on maize plants than on the 
      other three hosts. Larval diets had a significant varying effect on the finite 
      and intrinsic increase rates, reflecting that maize was the most suitable diet. 
      The findings of the present study are useful for predicting population dynamics 
      especially in areas cultivating Poaceae crops, except maize, to develop 
      sustainable integrated pest management strategies for this pest.

TI  - Oxysterols in catfish skin secretions (Arius bilineatus, Val.) exhibit 
      anti-cancer properties.
PG  - 1001067
LID - 10.3389/fphar.2022.1001067 [doi]
LID - 1001067
AB  - The edible catfish Arius bilineatus, (Valenciennes) elaborates a proteinaceous 
      gel-like material through its epidermis when threatened or injured. Our on-going 
      studies on this gel have shown it to be a complex mixture of several biologically 
      active molecules. Anti-cancer studies on lipid fractions isolated from the 
      gel-like materials showed them to be active against several cancer cell lines. 
      This prompted us to investigate further the lipid composition of the catfish 
      epidermal gel secretions (EGS). Analysis of the lipid fraction of EGS resulted in 
      identification of 12 oxysterols including cholesterol and 2 deoxygenated steroids 
      i.e., 7alpha-hydroxy cholesterol, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol, 5,6 epoxycholesterol, 
      3beta-hydroxycholest-5-ene-7-one and cholesta-3,5-dien-7-one. Progesterone, 
      cholest-3,5-diene, cholesta-2,4-diene, cholest-3,5,6-triol and 4-cholesten-3-one 
      were found as minor components, and were identified through their MS, (1)HNMR and 
      FTIR spectral data and were compared with those of the standards. 
      Cholest-3,6-dione, cholesta-4,6-diene-3-one, cholesta-2,4-diene, and 
      cholesta-5,20(22)-dien-3-ol were found only in trace amounts and were identified 
      by GC/MS/MS spectral data. Since cholesterol is the major component of EGS, the 
      identified oxysterols (OS) are presumably cholesterol oxidation products. Many of 
      the identified OS are known important biological molecules that play vital 
      physiological role in the producer and recipient organisms. We report herein the 
      effects of these sterols on three human cancer cell lines in vitro, i.e., K-562 
      (CML cell line), MDA MB-231 (estrogen positive breast cancer cell line) and MCF-7 
      (estrogen negative breast cancer cell line). Interestingly significant (p < 0.05) 
      dose differences were observed between tested OS on cell types used. The presence 
      of these sterols in EGS may help explain some aspects of the physiological 
      activities of fraction B (FB) prepared from EGS, such as enhanced wound and 
      diabetic ulcer healing, anti-inflammatory action and cytotoxic activities 
      reported in our previous studies. The anti-proliferative actions of some of these 
      oxysterols especially the cholesterol 3,5,6-triol (#5) as established on selected 
      cancer cell lines in this study support our previous studies and make them 
      candidates for research for human application.

AB  - Obesity is one of the major health problems across the world and the leading 
      cause of death. Natural bioactive functional compounds (catechin, Cat and 
      gingerol, Gin) have been reported to control obesity. The application of a 
      nanoparticulate (NPs) delivery system has shown greater efficacy in the treatment 
      of different diseases. The present study was designed to prepare the Cat-Gin 
      silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the microwave method. The prepared 
      Cat-Gin-AgNPs were characterized for particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation 
      efficiency and drug release. Further, it was evaluated for anti-obesity activity 
      (body weight, total abdominal fat, lipid profile and liver profile) using a 
      high-fed diet (HFD) induced obesity model. The formulated Cat-Gin-AGNPs showed 
      nano-metric size (110 +/- 4.65 nm), polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.27 +/- 0.03, and 
      surface charge (-17.6 +/- 2.6 mV) with a spherical shape. It also depicted high 
      encapsulation efficiency (<80 %) with prolonged drug release behaviour (Cat - 
      84.34 +/- 4.12 % and Gin - 72.33 +/- 3.87 %). The in vivo study parameters revealed a 
      significant (p </= 0.001) reduction in body weight, food intake and total abdominal 
      fat. The biochemical results displayed a reversal in altered biochemical 
      parameters to the normal range (Group 4) as compared to HFD control (Group 2). It 
      also helps restored the liver enzymes in obese rats. The results of the study 
      highlighted the applicability of Cat-Gin-AGNPs as a novel delivery system in the 
      treatment of obesity.

TI  - Isolated Ascending Colon Gangrene With Persistent Ascending Mesocolon: A Case 
      Report.
PG  - e29978
LID - 10.7759/cureus.29978 [doi]
LID - e29978
AB  - Persistent mesocolon is a rare embryological anomaly that occurs when the 
      primitive dorsal mesocolon fails to fuse with the posterior lateral parietal 
      peritoneum allowing for volvulus of the cecum and colon. In malrotation of the 
      gut, the normal rotation of the embryonic gut is arrested or disturbed during 
      in-utero development. To our knowledge, this is the first case of isolated colon 
      gangrene with persistent ascending mesocolon to be reported, although earlier 
      studies have documented cases of persistent mesocolon of both ascending and 
      descending mesocolon. This case had signs of acute intestinal obstruction and 
      peritonitis, and preoperative imaging was suggestive of sigmoid volvulus. 
      Explorative laparotomy revealed a hugely dilated and gangrenous ascending colon; 
      the fixed part of the small intestine was found in the subhepatic space, and the 
      hepatic flexure was at a level below the transpyloric plane in the midclavicular 
      line. Findings were suggestive of isolated colon gangrene with persistent 
      ascending mesocolon and malrotation of the gut. Right hemicolectomy with terminal 
      ileostomy was performed and postoperative follow-up showed no complications. For 
      a young patient with no prior co-morbidities, a volvulus of ascending mesocolon 
      diagnosis was deemed unlikely because ascending colon is a retroperitoneal organ. 
      The medial position of ascending mesocolon and small bowel loops to the right 
      side was a crucial intra-operative clue for diagnosis. Such cases are difficult 
      to diagnose pre-operatively through imaging alone, hence explorative laparotomy 
      becomes necessary. Intra-operative findings led to performing a right 
      hemicolectomy and ileostomy to relieve the obstruction. Therefore, among other 
      congenital reasons for intestinal obstruction, surgeons should consider 
      persistent mesocolon and volvulus as differential diagnoses when evaluating young 
      patients. Emergent surgery is the only approach to address this.

TI  - Rapunzel Syndrome in a Teenage Girl: A Case Report.
PG  - e29975
LID - 10.7759/cureus.29975 [doi]
LID - e29975
AB  - Trichobezoars are concretions of retained, undigested material, mostly hair or 
      hair-like fibers in the stomach. Rapunzel syndrome is the condition when 
      trichobezoars extend into the small bowel, leading to various complications 
      including bowel obstruction, and perforation due to pressure necrosis. We present 
      an interesting case of trichobezoar in a 15-year-old female patient, who 
      presented with abdominal pain for one month duration. The exam was notable for a 
      firm palpable mass in the epigastric area associated with localized tenderness 
      and guarding. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen showed a distended stomach with 
      the bezoar, dilated duodenal loops, and clumping of proximal jejunal loops. Upper 
      gastrointestinal endoscopy showed a trichobezoar extending from the 
      oesophagogastric junction to the pylorus. Endoscopic removal of the trichobezoar 
      was not successful.  An elective laparotomy was performed, during which the 
      stomach, duodenum, and proximal jejunum were dilated. The trichobezoar, measuring 
      35 cm in length, extended from the body of the stomach to the proximal jejunum 
      and caused jejunal perforation due to pressure necrosis. The trichobezoar was 
      removed and primary closure of jejunal perforation with diversion 
      gastrojejunostomy and jejunostomy was done. There were no postoperative 
      complications. The patient followed up with psychiatry in the clinic after 
      discharge, she was diagnosed with trichotillomania and started on fluoxetine, 
      with improvement in her behavioral symptoms. In young female patients with 
      nonspecific chronic abdomen pain and a palpable mass, trichobezoar should be 
      considered in the differential diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced abdomen CT is the 
      preferred imaging modality and removal of the trichobezoar with an appropriate 
      endoscopic or surgical procedure is the treatment of choice. It is essential to 
      diagnose and treat the underlying behavioral condition to prevent recurrent 
      episodes.

PG  - 2065-2070
LID - 10.12669/pjms.38.8.6524 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To screen Haemophilia-A patients for five known recurrent F8 gene 
      variants and to analyze CA repeats in intron 13 of F8 gene in the mother and the 
      affected child pairs. METHODS: In this descriptive cross sectional study, 80 
      unrelated pairs of "mother and son" affected by Haemophilia-A were recruited as 
      subjects. After collection of samples DNA was extracted using the Chelex 
      (Bio-Rad, USA) method. Five known F8 gene variants were screened in the mothers 
      and the affected sons by the allele specific PCR. The amplified products were 
      separated on 2% agarose gels.CA repeats in intron 13 of the F8 gene in the mother 
      and the affected child pairs were analyzed by Sanger sequencing method. The CA 
      repeat alleles were used to look for the feasibility of linkage based diagnosis 
      of Haemophilia-A in the affected families. The data were analyzed using 
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22.0. RESULTS: In the 80 
      subject "mother and son" pairs a recurrent F8 gene variant was found in 32 pairs 
      (40%). The most recurrent variant c.6869G>A was seen in 12 (15%). Linkage based 
      analysis of the CA repeats in intron 13 was found to be informative in 29 (36.2%) 
      mother-son pairs. CONCLUSION: The five known Haemophilia-A disease causing 
      variants were found in 40% of the Pakistani Haemophilia-A patients. The five 
      recurrent F8 gene variants and the CA repeats in intron 13 of F8 gene can provide 
      a comprehensive basis for carrying out prenatal diagnosis and carrier screening 
      in majority of the Pakistani Haemophilia-A families.

TI  - The Relationship between Ciprofloxacin Resistance and Genotypic Changes in S. 
      aureus Ocular Isolates.
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11111354 [doi]
LID - 1354
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a frequent cause of eye infections with some 
      isolates exhibiting increased antimicrobial resistance to commonly prescribed 
      antibiotics. The increasing resistance of ocular S. aureus to ciprofloxacin is a 
      serious concern as it is a commonly used as a first line antibiotic to treat S. 
      aureus keratitis. This study aimed to analyse genetic mutations in the genomes of 
      25 S. aureus isolates from infections or non-infectious ocular conditions from 
      the USA and Australia and their relationship to ciprofloxacin resistance. 
      Overall, 14/25 isolates were phenotypically resistant to ciprofloxacin. All 
      isolates were analyzed for mutations in their quinolone resistance-determining 
      regions (QRDRs) and efflux pump genes. Of the fourteen resistant isolates, 9/14 
      had ciprofloxacin resistance mutations within their QRDRs, at codons 80 or 84 
      within the parC subunit and codon 84 within the gyrA subunit of DNA gyrase. The 
      highest resistance (MIC = 2560 mug/mL) was associated with two SNPs in both gyrA 
      and parC. Other resistant isolates (3/14) had mutations within norB. Mutations in 
      genes of other efflux pumps and their regulator (norA, norC, mepA, mdeA, sepA, 
      sdrM, mepR, arlR, and arlS) or the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system (mutL and 
      mutS) were not associated with increased resistance to ciprofloxacin. The 
      functional mutations associated with ciprofloxacin resistance in QRDRs (gyrA and 
      parC) and norB suggests that these are the most common reasons for ciprofloxacin 
      resistance in ocular isolates. Novel SNPs of gyrA Glu-88-Leu, Asn-860-Thr and 
      Thr-845-Ala and IIe-855-Met, identified in this study, need further gene knock 
      out/in studies to better understand their effect on ciprofloxacin resistance.

TI  - Mechanical and Durability Evaluation of Metakaolin as Cement Replacement Material 
      in Concrete.
LID - 10.3390/ma15227868 [doi]
LID - 7868
AB  - Due to the increasing prices of cement and its harmful effect on the environment, 
      the use of cement has become highly unsustainable in concrete. There is a 
      considerable need for promoting the use of cement replacement materials. This 
      study investigates the effect of variable percentages of metakaolin (MK) on the 
      mechanical and durability performance of concrete. Kaolin clay (KC) was used in 
      the current research to prepare the MK by the calcination process; it was ground 
      in a ball mill to its maximum achievable fineness value of 2550 m(2)/Kg. Four 
      replacement levels of MK, i.e., 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% by weight of cement, in 
      addition to control samples, at a constant water-to-cement (w/c) ratio of 0.55 
      were used. For evaluating the mechanical and durability performance, 27 cubes (6 
      in. x 6 in. x 6 in.) and 6 cylinders (3.875 in. diameter, 2 in. height) were cast 
      for each mix. These samples were tested for compressive strength under standard 
      conditions and in an acidic environment, in addition to being subjected to water 
      permeability, sorptivity, and water absorption tests. Chemical analysis revealed 
      that MK could be used as pozzolana as per the American Society for Testing and 
      Materials (ASTM C 618:2003). The results demonstrated an increased compressive 
      strength of concrete owing to an increased percentage of MK in the mix with 
      aging. In particular, the concrete having 20% MK after curing under standard 
      conditions exhibited 33.43% higher compressive strength at 90 days as compared to 
      similarly aged control concrete. However, with increasing MK, the workability of 
      concrete decreased drastically. After being subjected to an acid attack 
      (immersing concrete cubes in 2% sulfuric acid solution), the samples exhibited a 
      significant decrease in compressive strength at 90 days in comparison to those 
      without acid attack at the same age. The density of acid attack increased with 
      increasing MK with a maximum corresponding to 5% MK concrete. The current 
      findings suggest that the local MK has the potential to produce good-quality 
      concrete in a normal environment.

TI  - HPLC, FTIR and GC-MS Analyses of Thymus vulgaris Phytochemicals Executing In

      Cancer Genes Computationally.
LID - 10.3390/molecules27238512 [doi]

AB  - Medicinal plants have played an essential role in the treatment of various 
      diseases. Thymus vulgaris, a medicinal plant, has been extensively used for 
      biological and pharmaceutical potential. The current study was performed to check 
      the biopotential of active biological compounds. The GC-MS analysis identified 31 
      compounds in methanolic crude extract, among which thymol, carvacrol, p-cymene, 
      and eugenol are the main phytoconstituents present in T. vulgaris. The HPLC 
      analysis quantified that flavonoids and phenolic acids are present in a good 
      concentration in the active fraction of ethyl acetate and n-butanol. FTIR 
      confirmed the presence of functional groups such as phenols, a carboxylic group, 
      hydroxy group, alcohols, and a benzene ring. Among both fractions, ethyl acetate 
      showed high antioxidant activity in the DPPH (84.1 0.88) and ABTS (87.1 0.89) 
      assays, respectively. The anti-inflammatory activity of the fractions was done in 
      vitro and in vivo by using a carrageenan-induced paw edema assay, while the 
      hexane-based extract showed high anti-inflammatory activity (57.1 0.54) in a 
      dose-response manner. Furthermore, the lead compound responsible for inhibition 
      in the denaturation of proteins is thymol, which exhibits the highest binding 
      affinity with COX1 (-6.4 KJ/mol) and COX2 (-6.3 KJ/mol) inflammatory proteins. 
      The hepatotoxicity analysis showed that plant-based phytoconstituents are safe to 
      use and have no toxicity, with no necrosis, fibrosis, and vacuolar degeneration, 
      even at a high concentration of 800 mg/kg body weight. Furthermore, the in silico 
      analysis of HPLC phytochemical compounds against gastric cancer genes showed that 
      chlorogenic acid exhibited anticancer activity and showed good drug-designing 
      characteristics. Thrombolysis and hemolysis are the major concerns of individuals 
      suffering from gastric cancer. However, the T. vulgaris fractions showed 
      thrombolysis from 17.6 to 5.4%; similarly, hemolysis ranged from 9.73 to 7.1% at 
      a concentration of 12 mg/mL. The phytoconstituents present in T. vulgaris have 
      the potential for multiple pharmacological applications. This should be further 
      investigated to isolate bioactive compounds that can be used for the treatment of 
      different ailments.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is the gradual and selective degradation of 
      dopamine-releasing neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and results 
      in postural instability, stiffness, bradykinesia, and resting tremor. The goal of 
      this research was to see how hibiscetin action on PD in rotenone-treated rats. 
      Rats were administered orally with hibiscetin (10 mg/kg) after 1 h rotenone 
      (0.5 mg/kg, s.c.). This therapy regimen was followed on a daily basis for 
      28 days. Rats were tested for catalepsy and akinesia on day 29 after the last 
      dosage of rotenone. Biochemical parameters were performed to measure reduced 
      glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde 
      (MDA), nitrite, neuroinflammatory cytokines, and neurotransmitter and their 
      metabolite levels such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), 
      3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 
      5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Rotenone-induced akinesia and catatonia in 
      rats decreased endogenous antioxidant (GSH, CAT, and SOD) levels, increased MDA 
      and nitrite levels, and changed neurotransmitter and metabolite levels. 
      Hibiscetin effectively reduced rotenone-induced akinesia and catatonia, improved 
      endogenous antioxidant (GSH, CAT and SOD) levels, and reduced oxidative and 
      nitrative stress in the treated rats. Moreover, hibiscetin restored altered 
      neurotransmitters and their metabolites to normal levels in rotenone-treated 
      rats. The study results showed that hibiscetin has anti-Parkinson's activity 
      against rotenone-induced PD in rats.

AB  - In this work, Cu(2)WS(4) nanoparticles have been synthesized via a solvothermal 
      decomposition approach using a heterobimetallic single source precursor, 
      WCu(2)S(4)(PPh(3))(3). The single source precursor, WCu(2)S(4)(PPh(3))(3), has 
      been characterized using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, while Cu(2)WS(4) 
      nanoparticles have been characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) for 
      which Rietveld refinement has been performed to authenticate the lattice 
      structure of the decomposed product, Cu(2)WS(4). Furthermore, FESEM and EDAX 
      analyses have been performed to assess the morphology and composition of 
      Cu(2)WS(4). An electrochemical study in acidic as well as basic media suggested 
      that Cu(2)WS(4) nanoparticles possess efficient bifunctional activity towards 
      electrochemical hydrogen as well as oxygen evolution reactions. Linear sweep 
      voltammetry (LSV) performed in 0.5 N H(2)SO(4) indicates an onset potential for 
      the HER of 462 mV and a Tafel slope of 140 mV dec(-1). While LSV performed in 0.1 
      M KOH indicates an onset potential for the OER of 190 mV and a Tafel Slope of 117 
      mV dec(-1).

TI  - Multiomics Based Association Mapping in Wheat Reveals Genetic Architecture of 
      Quality and Allergenic Related Proteins.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24021485 [doi]
LID - 1485
AB  - Wheat is an important staple crop since its proteins contribute to human and 
      animal nutrition and are important for its end-use quality. However, wheat 
      proteins can also cause adverse human reactions for a large number of people. We 
      performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) on 114 proteins quantified by 
      LC-MS-based proteomics and expressed in an environmentally stable manner in 148 
      wheat cultivars with a heritability > 0.6. For 54 proteins, we detected 
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) that exceeded the Bonferroni-corrected significance 
      threshold and explained 17.3-84.5% of the genotypic variance. Proteins in the 
      same family often clustered at a very close chromosomal position or the potential 
      homeolog. Major QTLs were found for four well-known glutenin and gliadin 
      subunits, and the QTL segregation pattern in the protein encoding the high 
      molecular weight glutenin subunit Dx5 could be confirmed by SDS 
      gel-electrophoresis. For nine potential allergenic proteins, large QTLs could be 
      identified, and their measured allele frequencies open the possibility to select 
      for low protein abundance by markers as long as their relevance for human health 
      has been conclusively demonstrated. A potential allergen was introduced in the 
      beginning of 1980s that may be linked to the cluster of resistance genes 
      introgressed on chromosome 2AS from Triticum ventricosum. The reported sequence 
      information for the 54 major QTLs can be used to design efficient markers for 
      future wheat breeding.

AB  - Typhoid fever is transmitted by ingestion of polluted water, contaminated food, 
      and stool of typhoid-infected individuals, mostly in developing countries with 
      poor hygienic environments. To find novel therapeutic targets and inhibitors, We 
      employed a subtractive genomics strategy towards Salmonella Typhi and the 
      complete genomes of eight strains were primarily subjected to the EDGAR tool to 
      predict the core genome (n = 3207). Human non-homology (n = 2450) was followed by 
      essential genes identification (n = 37). The STRING database predicted maximum 
      protein-protein interactions, followed by cellular localization. The 
      virulent/immunogenic ability of predicted genes were checked to differentiate 
      drug and vaccine targets. Furthermore, the 3D models of the identified putative 
      proteins encoded by the respective genes were constructed and subjected to 
      druggability analyses where only "highly druggable" proteins were selected for 
      molecular docking and simulation analyses. The putative targets ATP-dependent CLP 
      protease proteolytic subunit, Imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase hisH, 
      7,8-dihydropteroate synthase folP and 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate-independent 
      phosphoglycerate mutase gpmI were screened against a drug-like library 
      (n = 12,000) and top hits were selected based on H-bonds, RMSD and energy scores. 
      Finally, the ADMET properties for novel inhibitors ZINC19340748, ZINC09319798, 
      ZINC00494142, ZINC32918650 were optimized followed by binding free energy 
      (MM/PBSA) calculation for ligand-receptor complexes. The findings of this work 
      are expected to aid in expediting the identification of novel protein targets and 
      inhibitors in combating typhoid Salmonellosis, in addition to the already 
      existing therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A factor leading to Alzheimer's Disease (AD), portrayed by peripheral 
      insulin resistance, is Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The likelihood of T2D 
      cases would be at boosted danger in alternating AD cases has severe social 
      consequences. Several genes have been detected via gene expression profiling or 
      different techniques; despite the consideration of the utility of numerous of 
      these genes stays insufficient. METHODS: This project is designed to uncover the 
      mutual genomics motifs between AD and T2D via non-negative matrix factorization 
      (NMF) of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of T2D Mellitus of human cortical 
      neurons of the neurovascular unit gene expression data. A rank factorization 
      value is calculated by employing the combination of the NMF model with the unit 
      invariant knee (UIK) point method. The metagenes are further determined by 
      remarking the enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and 
      gene ontology (GO) enrichment tools. In this study, the most highly expressed 
      genes of metagenes are subjected to protein-protein interaction (PPI) network 
      study to discover the most significant biomarkers of T2D Mellitus in the ageing 
      brain. RESULTS: We screened the most important shared genes (CDKN1A, COL22A1, 
      EIF4A, GFAP, SLC1A1, and VIM) and essential human molecular pathways that 
      motivate these diseases. The study aimed to validate the most significant hub 
      genes using network-based methods which detected the corresponding relationship 
      between AD and T2D. CONCLUSIONS: Using in silico tools, the computational 
      pipeline has broadly examined transformed pathways and discovered promising 
      biomarkers and drug targets. We validated the most significant hub genes using 
      network-based methods which detected the corresponding relationship between AD 
      and T2D. These consequences on brain cells hypothetically reserve to diabetic

AB  - Sterubin, a flavanone is an active chemical compound that possesses 
      neuroprotective activity. The current investigation was intended to assess the 
      sterubin effect in scopolamine-activated Alzheimer's disease. The rats were 
      induced with scopolamine (1.5 mg/kg) followed by treatment with sterubin 
      (10 mg/kg) for 14 days. Behavioural analysis was predictable by the Y-maze test 
      and Morris water test. Biochemical variables like nitric oxide 
      acetylcholinesterase, Choline acetyltransferase, antioxidant markers like 
      superoxide dismutase, glutathione transferase, malondialdehyde, catalase, and 
      myeloperoxidase activity, neuroinflammatory markers such as tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha, nuclear factor kappa B, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL-1beta), and 
      IL-6 were measured. The result stated that sterubin reversed the oxidative stress 
      parameters, increased motor performance, and lowered the inflammatory markers in 
      scopolamine-induced rats. The study demonstrated that sterubin possesses 
      neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties which can be used 
      as a beneficial medication in AD.

AB  - Synthetic insecticides have been an inevitable part of plant protection 
      throughout the world. Sublethal effects of these chemicals on beneficial insect 
      species are one of the contemporary issues these days. Using the age-stage, 
      two-sex life table model, this study evaluated the sublethal and 
      transgenerational effects of six synthetic insecticides (imidacloprid, 
      thiamethoxam, lambda-cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos and profenofos) 
      commonly applied to winter vegetables, on the fitness and predation of the 
      seven-spotted ladybeetle, Coccinella septempunctata, which is an efficient 
      predator of aphids worldwide. According to results, all insecticides at their 
      sublethal doses (LC(30)) significantly suppressed the emergence of adults, adult 
      weight, fertility and fecundity of the parental generation compared to control 
      treatment. The larval stage was prolonged and oviposition, fecundity and total 
      longevity of the adult beetles were decreased in unexposed progeny whose parents 
      were exposed to sublethal doses of all insecticides. Moreover, the biological 
      parameters of adults, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate 
      of increase (lambda) and net reproductive rate (R (0)) were significantly reduced when 
      exposed to sublethal doses of insecticides. The predation rate of the F(1) 
      generation adults was also decreased after exposure to the sublethal doses of 
      insecticides. However, chlorpyrifos, profenofos, lambda-cyhalothrin and 
      cypermethrin exhibited more deleterious effects on the fitness and population 
      parameters of beetles than imidacloprid and thiamethoxam.

TI  - Association of BDNF gene missense polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) with three 
      quantitative traits, namely, intelligence quotient, body mass index, and blood 
      pressure: A genetic association analysis from North India.
PG  - 1035885

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotransmitter 
      modulator, plays a significant role in neuronal survival and growth and 
      participates in neuronal plasticity, thus being essential for learning, memory, 
      and the development of cognition. Additionally, it is crucial for appetite, 
      weight, and metabolic control and plays a pivotal role in the cardiovascular 
      system. The Val66Met polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene causes a decrease in 
      BDNF secretion and plays a role in impairments in cognition, energy homeostasis, 
      and cardiovascular events. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of 
      polymorphism (rs6265) of the BDNF gene with three quantitative traits 
      simultaneously, namely, intelligence quotient (IQ), body mass index (BMI), and 
      blood pressure (BP). METHODS: Psychometric, morphometric, and physiometric data 
      of the total participants (N = 246) were collected. WASI-II(INDIA) was used to 
      measure cognitive ability. Genotyping was carried out using allele-specific PCR 
      for the rs6265 polymorphism (C196T), and genotypes were determined. Statistical 
      analyses were performed at p < 0.05 significance level using MS-Excel and 
      SigmaPlot. The odds ratio models with a 95% confidence interval were used to test 
      the associations. The used models are co-dominant, recessive, dominant, 
      over-dominant, and additive. RESULTS: The allelic frequencies of alleles C and T 
      were 72 and 28%, respectively. Under the dominant genetic model, a significant 
      susceptible association of minor allele T was observed with a lower average 
      verbal comprehensive index (OR = 2.216, p = 0.003, CI (95%) =1.33-3.69), a lower 
      average performance reasoning index (OR = 2.634, p < 0.001, CI (95%) = 
      1.573-4.41), and a lower average full-scale IQ-4 (OR = 3.159, p < 0.001, CI (95%) 
      = 1.873-5.328). Carriers of Met-alleles were found to have an increased body mass 
      index (OR = 2.538, p < 0.001, CI (95%) = 1.507-4.275), decreased systolic blood 
      pressure (OR = 2.051, p = 0.012, CI (95%) = 1.202-3.502), and decreased diastolic 
      blood pressure (OR = 2.162, p = 0.006, CI (95%) = 1.278-3.657). Under the 
      recessive genetic model, several folds decrease in IQ and BP and an increase in 
      BMI with the presence of the T allele was also detected. CONCLUSION: This novel 
      study may improve our understanding of genetic alterations to the traits and 
      hence be helpful for clinicians and researchers to investigate the diagnostic and 
      prognostic value of this neurotrophic factor.

TI  - Mineral and Phytic Acid Content as Well as Phytase Activity in Flours and Breads 
      Made from Different Wheat Species.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24032770 [doi]
LID - 2770
AB  - Wheat is of high importance for a healthy and sustainable diet for the growing 
      world population, partly due to its high mineral content. However, several 
      minerals are bound in a phytate complex in the grain and unavailable to humans. 
      We performed a series of trials to compare the contents of minerals and phytic 
      acid as well as phytase activity in several varieties from alternative wheat 
      species spelt, emmer and einkorn with common wheat. Additionally, we investigated 
      the potential of recent popular bread making recipes in German bakeries to reduce 
      phytic acid content, and thus increase mineral bioavailability in bread. For all 
      studied ingredients, we found considerable variance both between varieties within 
      a species and across wheat species. For example, whole grain flours, particularly 
      from emmer and einkorn, appear to have higher mineral content than common wheat, 
      but also a higher phytic acid content with similar phytase activity. Bread making 
      recipes had a greater effect on phytic acid content in the final bread than the 
      choice of species for whole grain flour production. Recipes with long yeast 
      proofing or sourdough and the use of whole grain rye flour in a mixed wheat bread 
      minimized the phytic acid content in the bread. Consequently, optimizing food to 
      better nourish a growing world requires close collaboration between research 
      organizations and practical stakeholders ensuring a streamlined sustainable 
      process from farm to fork.

TI  - The coefficients of inbreeding revealed by ROH study among inbred individuals 
      belonging to each type of the first cousin marriage: A preliminary report from 
      North India.
PG  - 813-825
LID - 10.1007/s13258-023-01367-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genome-wide runs of homozygosity (ROH) are appropriate to estimate 
      genomic inbreeding, determine population history, unravel the genetic 
      architecture of complex traits and disorders. OBJECTIVE: The study sought to 
      investigate and compare the actual proportion of homozygosity or autozygosity in 
      the genomes of progeny of four subtypes of first cousin mating in humans, using 
      both pedigree and genomic measures for autosomes and sex chromosomes. METHODS: 
      For this purpose, Illumina Global Screening Array-24 v1.0 BeadChip followed by 
      cyto-ROH analysis through Illumina Genome Studio was used to characterise the 
      homozygosity in five participants from North Indian state (Uttar Pradesh). PLINK 
      v.1.9 software was used to estimate the genomic inbreeding coefficients viz. 
      ROH-based inbreeding estimate (F(ROH)) and homozygous loci-based inbreeding 
      estimate (F(HOM)). RESULTS: A total of 133 ROH segments were detected with 
      maximum number and genomic coverage in Matrilateral Parallel (MP) type and 
      minimum in outbred individual. ROH pattern revealed that MP type has a higher 
      degree of homozygosity than other subtypes. The comparison of F(ROH), F(HOM), and 
      pedigree-based inbreeding estimate (F(PED)) showed some difference in theoretical 
      and realised proportion of homozygosity for sex-chromosomal loci but not for 
      autosome for each type of consanguinity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the very first 
      study to compare and estimate the pattern of homozygosity among the kindreds of 
      first cousin unions. However, a greater number of individuals from each type of 
      marriage is required for statistical inference of no difference between 
      theoretical and realized homozygosity among different degrees of inbreeding 
      prevalent in humans worldwide.

TI  - Cytotoxicity Mechanisms of Blue-Light-Activated Curcumin in T98G Cell Line: 
      Inducing Apoptosis through ROS-Dependent Downregulation of MMP Pathways.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24043842 [doi]
LID - 3842
AB  - We examined the photodynamic activation of Curcumin under blue light in 
      glioblastoma T98G cells. The therapeutic effect of Curcumin, in both the absence 
      and presence of blue light, was measured by the MTT assay and apoptosis 
      progression using flow cytometry. Fluorescence imaging was carried out to 
      evaluate Curcumin uptake. Photodynamic activation of Curcumin (10 microM), in the 
      presence of blue light, enhanced its cytotoxic effect, resulting in the 
      activation of ROS-dependent apoptotic pathways in T98G cells. The gene expression 
      studies showed the expression of matrixes metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) and 9 (MMP9) 
      decrease with Curcumin (10 microM) under blue light exposure, indicating possible 
      proteolytic mechanisms. Moreover, the cytometric appearance displayed that the 
      expressions of NF-kappaB and Nrf2 were found to be increased upon exposure to blue 
      light, which revealed a significant induction of expression of nuclear factor as 
      a result of blue-light-induced oxidative stress and cell death. These data 
      further demonstrate that Curcumin exhibited a photodynamic effect via induction 
      of ROS-mediated apoptosis in the presence of blue light. Our results suggest that 
      the application of blue light enhances the therapeutic efficacy of Curcumin in 
      glioblastoma because of the phototherapeutic effect.

AB  - Herbal products are preferable to synthetic medicines, and the use of traditional 
      medicines is increasing day-by-day. The current study was designed to evaluate 
      the potentials of bioactive compounds from Citrullus colocynthis by performing 
      FTIR, HPLC, and GC-MS analyses, which explore the good concentration of the 
      secondary metabolites, such as gallic acid (74.854 ppm), vanillic acid (122.616 
      ppm), and ferulic acid (101.045 ppm) with considerable bioactivities. 
      Antimicrobial protein was estimated by performing SDS-PAGE, ranging from 15 to 70 
      kDa in all protein fractions. The current study also checked the cytotoxicity of 
      the bioactive compounds in the active fraction of C. colocynthis, and to perform 
      this activity, the groups of rats were arranged with 16 rats randomly divided 
      into four groups (three experimental and one control) by administering various 
      dosage of methanolic fractions in dose-dependent manner. Histopathology was 
      conducted on the livers of the rats after 15 days of sacrifice under deep 
      anesthesia. In liver cell slides examined at the maximum dose of 600 mg/kg, 
      minimal morphological changes, such as slight ballooning, nuclear variation, 
      vacuolar degeneration, and hydropic degeneration, were observed. Furthermore, the 
      in silico analysis identified bioactive compounds as potential drug candidates.

AB  - Defending against future pandemics may require vaccine platforms that protect 
      across a range of related pathogens. The presentation of multiple 
      receptor-binding domains (RBDs) from evolutionarily-related viruses on a 
      nanoparticle scaffold elicits a strong antibody response to conserved regions. 
      Here we produce quartets of tandemly-linked RBDs from SARS-like betacoronaviruses 
      coupled to the mi3 nanocage through a SpyTag/SpyCatcher spontaneous reaction. 
      These Quartet Nanocages induce a high level of neutralizing antibodies against 
      several different coronaviruses, including against viruses not represented on the 
      vaccine. In animals primed with SARS-CoV-2 Spike, boost immunizations with 
      Quartet Nanocages increased the strength and breadth of an otherwise narrow 
      immune response. Quartet Nanocages are a strategy with potential to confer 
      heterotypic protection against emergent zoonotic coronavirus pathogens and 
      facilitate proactive pandemic protection.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of combined 
      hydrocortisone, vitamin C, and thiamine (triple therapy) on the mortality of 
      patients with septic shock. Methods : This multicenter, open-label, two-arm 
      parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted in four intensive care 
      units in Qatar. Adult patients diagnosed with septic shock requiring 
      norepinephrine at a rate of >/=0.1 mug/kg/min for >/=6 h were randomized to a triple 
      therapy group or a control group. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality 
      at 60 days or at discharge, whichever occurred first. Secondary outcomes included 
      time to death, change in Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at 72 h 
      of randomization, intensive care unit length of stay, hospital length of stay, 
      and vasopressor duration. Results: A total of 106 patients (53 in each group) 
      were enrolled in this study. The study was terminated early because of a lack of 
      funding. The median baseline SOFA score was 10 (interquartile range, 8-12). The 
      primary outcomes were similar between the two groups (triple therapy, 28.3% vs. 
      control, 35.8%; P = 0.41). Vasopressor duration among the survivors was similar 
      between the two groups (triple therapy, 50 h vs. control, 58 h; P = 0.44). Other 
      secondary and safety endpoints were similar between the two groups. Conclusion: 
      Triple therapy did not improve in-hospital mortality at 60 days in critically ill 
      patients with septic shock or reduce the vasopressor duration or SOFA score at 72 
      h. Trial Registration:ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03380507. Registered on 
      December 21, 2017.

AB  - Heavy metal (HM) contamination and high environmental temperature (HT) are caused 
      by anthropogenic activities that negatively impact soil microbial communities and 
      agricultural productivity. Although HM contaminations have deleterious effects on 
      microbes and plants; there are hardly any reports on the combined effects of HM 
      and HT. Here, we reported that HT coupled with cadmium (Cd) accumulation in soil 
      and irrigated water could seriously affect crop growth and productivity, 
      alternatively influencing the microbial community and nutrient cycles of paddy 
      soils in rice fields. We analyzed different mechanisms of plants and microflora 
      in the rhizospheric region, such as plant rhizospheric nitrification, endophytes 
      colonization, nutrient uptake, and physiology of temperature-sensitive (IR64) and 
      temperature-resistant Huanghuazhan (HZ) rice cultivars against different Cd 
      levels (2, 5 and 10 mg kg(-1)) with rice plants grown under 25  degrees C and 40  degrees C 
      temperatures. Consequently, an increment in Cd accumulation was observed with 
      rising temperature leading to enhanced expression of OsNTRs. In contrast, a 
      greater decline in the microbial community was detected in IR64 cultivar than HZ. 
      Similarly, ammonium oxidation, root-IAA, shoot-ABA production, and 16S rRNA gene 
      abundance in the rhizosphere and endosphere were significantly influenced by HT 
      and Cd levels, resulting in a significant decrease in the colonization of 
      endophytes and the surface area of roots, leading to a decreased N uptake from 
      the soil. Overall, the outcomes of this study unveiled the novel effects of Cd, 
      temperature, and their combined effect on rice growth and functions of the 
      microbial community. These results provide effective strategies to overcome 
      Cd-phytotoxicity on the health of endophytes and rhizospheric bacteria in 
      Cd-contaminated soil by using temperature-tolerant rice cultivars.

AB  - For many decades, uracil has been an antineoplastic agent used in combination 
      with tegafur to treat various human cancers, including breast, prostate, and 
      liver cancer. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the molecular features of 
      uracil and its derivatives. Herein, the molecule's 5-hydroxymethyluracil has been 
      thoroughly characterized by NMR, UV-Vis, and FT-IR spectroscopy by means of 
      experimental and theoretical analysis. Density functional theory (DFT) using the 
      B3LYP method at 6-311++G(d,p) was computed to achieve the optimized geometric 
      parameters of the molecule in the ground state. For further investigation and 
      computation of the NLO, NBO, NHO analysis, and FMO, the improved geometrical 
      parameters were utilized. The potential energy distribution was used to allocate 
      the vibrational frequencies using the VEDA 4 program. The NBO study determined 
      the relationship between the donor and acceptor. The molecule's charge 
      distribution and reactive regions were highlighted using the MEP and Fukui 
      functions. Maps of the hole and electron density distribution in the excited 
      state were generated using the TD-DFT method and PCM solvent model in order to 
      reveal electronic characteristics. The energies and diagrams for the lowest 
      unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital 
      (HOMO) were also provided. The HOMO-LUMO band gap estimated the charge transport 
      within the molecule. When examining the intermolecular interactions in 5-HMU, 
      Hirshfeld surface analysis was used, and fingerprint plots were also produced. 
      The molecular docking investigation involved docking 5-HMU with six different 
      protein receptors. Molecular dynamic simulation has given a better idea of the 
      binding of the ligand with protein.

AB  - Wheat is an important staple food and its processing quality is largely driven by 
      proteins. However, there is a sizable number of people with inflammatory 
      reactions to wheat proteins, namely celiac disease, wheat allergy and the 
      syndrome of non-celiac wheat sensitivity. Thus, proteome profiles should be of 
      high importance for stakeholders along the wheat supply chain. We applied liquid 
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics to establish the flour 
      reference proteome for five wheat species, ancient to modern, each based on 10 
      cultivars grown in three diverse environments. We identified at least 2540 
      proteins in each species and a cluster analyses clearly separated the species 
      based on their proteome profiles. Even more, >50% of proteins significantly 
      differed between species - many of them implicated in products' quality, 
      grain-starch synthesis, plant stress regulation and proven or potential allergic 
      reactions in humans. Notably, the expression of several important wheat proteins 
      was found to be mainly driven by genetics vs. environmental factors, which 
      enables selection and refinement of improved cultivars for the wheat supply chain 
      as long as rapid test methods will be developed. Especially einkorn expressed 5.4 
      and 7.2-fold lower quantities of potential allergens and immunogenic amylase 
      trypsin inhibitors, respectively, than common wheat, whereas potential allergen 
      content was intermediate in tetraploid wheat species. This urgently warrants 
      well-targeted clinical studies, where the developed reference proteomes will help 
      to design representative test diets.

TI  - Hirsutidin Prevents Cisplatin-Evoked Renal Toxicity by Reducing Oxidative 
      Stress/Inflammation and Restoring the Endogenous Enzymatic and Non-Enzymatic 
      Level.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines11030804 [doi]

AB  - Recent research has shown that phytocomponents may be useful in the treatment of 
      renal toxicity. This study was conducted to evaluate the renal disease hirsutidin 
      in the paradigm of renal toxicity induced by cisplatin. Male Wistar rats were 
      given cisplatin (3 mg/kg body weight/day, for 25 days, i.p.) to induce renal 
      toxicity. Experimental rats were randomly allocated to four different groups: 
      group I received saline, group II received cisplatin, group III received 
      cisplatin + hirsutidin (10 mg/kg) and group IV (per se) received hirsutidin (10 
      m/kg) for 25 days. Various biochemical parameters were assessed, oxidative stress 
      (superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione transferase (GSH), malonaldehyde (MDA) 
      and catalase (CAT)), blood-chemistry parameters (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and 
      cholesterol), non-protein-nitrogenous components (uric acid, urea, and 
      creatinine), and anti-inflammatory-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 
      interleukin-1beta(IL-1beta). IL-6 and nuclear factor-kB (NFkappaB) were evaluated and 
      histopathology was conducted. Hirsutidin alleviated renal injury which was 
      manifested by significantly diminished uric acid, urea, urine volume, creatinine, 
      and BUN, compared to the cisplatin group. Hirsutidin restored the activities of 
      several antioxidant enzyme parameters-MDA, CAT, GSH, and SOD. Additionally, there 
      was a decline in the levels of inflammatory markers-TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and 
      NFkappaB-compared to the cisplatin group. The current research study shows that 
      hirsutidin may act as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of nephrotoxicity 
      induced by cisplatin.

TI  - Development and Characterization of Drug Loaded PVA/PCL Fibres for Wound Dressing 
      Applications.
LID - 10.3390/polym15061355 [doi]
LID - 1355
AB  - Nowadays, synthetic polymers are used in medical applications due to their 
      special biodegradable, biocompatible, hydrophilic, and non-toxic properties. The 
      materials, which can be used for wound dressing fabrication with controlled drug 
      release profile, are the need of the time. The main aim of this study was to 
      develop and characterize polyvinyl alcohol/polycaprolactone (PVA/PCL) fibres 
      containing a model drug. A dope solution comprising PVA/PCL with the drug was 
      extruded into a coagulation bath and became solidified. The developed PVA/PCL 
      fibres were then rinsed and dried. These fibres were tested for Fourier transform 
      infrared spectroscopy, linear density, topographic analysis, tensile properties, 
      liquid absorption, swelling behaviour, degradation, antimicrobial activity, and 
      drug release profile for improved and better healing of the wound. From the 
      results, it was concluded that PVA/PCL fibres containing a model drug can be 
      produced by using the wet spinning technique and have respectable tensile 
      properties; adequate liquid absorption, swelling %, and degradation %; and good 
      antimicrobial activity with the controlled drug release profile of the model drug 
      for wound dressing applications.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) has become the major health problem and the leading causes 
      of cancer mortality among men. PCa often progresses from an early 
      androgen-dependent form of cancer to a late (metastatic) androgen-independent 
      cancer, for which no effective treatment options are available. Current therapies 
      target testosterone depletion, androgen axis inhibition, androgen receptor (AR) 
      downregulation and regulation PSA expression. These conventional treatment 
      options, however, are intense and pose severe side effects. From the past few 
      years, plant-derived compounds or phytochemicals have attracted much attention by 
      the researchers worldwide for their promising approach in inhibiting the 
      development and growth of cancer. This review emphasizes mechanistic role of 
      promising phytochemicals on PCa. This review imparts to score anticancer efficacy 
      of promising phyto-agents luteolin, fisetin, coumestrol and hesperidin with focus 
      on the mechanistic action in management and treatment of PCa. These 
      phytocompounds were also selected for their best binding affinity with the ARs on 
      the basis of molecular docking studies.

LID - 10.3390/ijms24076393 [doi]

AB  - Herein, we investigate the combinatorial therapeutic effects of naturally 
      occurring flavonoids kaempferol (K) and fisetin (F) on triple-negative breast 
      cancer (TNBC: MDA-MB-231 cell line). Dose-dependent MTT assay results show that K 
      and F exhibited cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 cells at 62 and 75 muM (IC(50)), 
      respectively, after 24 h. However, combined K + F led to 40% and more than 50% 
      TNBC cell death observed at 10 and 20 muM, respectively, which revealed the 
      synergistic association of both. The combination of K and F was determined to be 
      more effective in inhibiting cell viability than either of the agents alone. The 
      morphological changes associated with significant apoptotic cell death were 
      observed under a fluorescent microscope, strongly supporting the synergistic 
      association between K and F. We also proposed that combining the effects of both 
      polyphenols, as opposed to their individual effects, would increase their in 
      vitro efficacy. Furthermore, we assessed the cell death pathway by the 
      combinational treatment via reactive oxygen species-induced DNA damage and the 
      mitochondrially mediated apoptotic pathway. This study reveals the prominent 
      synergistic role of phytochemicals, which helps in elevating the therapeutic 
      efficacy of dietary nutrients and that anticancer effects may be a result of 
      nutrients that act in concert.

TI  - Impact of perioperative direct oral anticoagulant assays: a multicenter cohort 
      study.
PG  - 155-162

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is little evidence to guide the perioperative management of 
      patients on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) in the absence of a last known 
      dose. Quantitative serum titers may be ordered, but there is little evidence 
      supporting this. AIMS: This multi-center retrospective cohort study of 
      consecutive surgical in-patients with a DOAC assay, performed over a five-year 
      period, aimed to characterize preoperative DOAC assay orders and their impact on 
      perioperative outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients prescribed regular DOAC 
      (both prophylactic and therapeutic dosing) with a preoperative DOAC assay were 
      included. The DOAC assay titer was evaluated against endpoints. Further, patients 
      with an assay were compared against anticoagulated patients who did not receive a 
      preoperative DOAC assay. The primary endpoint was major bleeding. Secondary 
      endpoints included perioperative hemoglobin change, blood transfusions, 
      idarucizumab or prothrombin complex concentrate administration, postoperative 
      thrombosis, in-hospital mortality and reoperation. Adjusted and unadjusted linear 
      regression models were used for continuous data. Binary logistic models were 
      performed for dichotomous outcomes. RESULTS: 1065 patients were included, 232 had 
      preoperative assays. Assays were ordered most commonly by Spinal (11.9%), 
      Orthopedics (15.4%), and Neurosurgery (19.4%). For every 10 ng/ml increase in 
      titer, the hemoglobin decreases by 0.5066 g/L and the odds of a preoperative 
      reversal increases by 13%. Compared to those without an assay, patients with 
      preoperative DOAC assays had odds 1.44x higher for major bleeding, 2.98x higher 
      for in-hospital mortality and 16.3x higher for receiving anticoagulant reversal. 
      CONCLUSION: A preoperative DOAC assay order was associated with worse outcomes 
      despite increased reversal administration. However, the DOAC assay titer can 
      reflect the patient's likelihood of bleeding.

TI  - Endophytic Colonization by Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae in Maize 
      Plants Affects the Fitness of Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae).
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11041067 [doi]
LID - 1067
AB  - The fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (Noctuidae; Lepidoptera), is a serious 
      threat to food security as it has the potential to feed on over 353 plant 
      species. To control this insect pest, endophytic colonization of entomopathogenic 
      fungi (EPF) in plants is being considered as a safer and more effective 
      alternative. This study evaluated the efficacy of two EPFs, Beauveria bassiana 
      and Metarhizium anisopliae, for endophytic colonization using foliar spray and 
      seed treatment methods on maize plants, and their impact on the survival, 
      development, and fecundity of S. frugiperda. Both EPF effectively colonized the 
      maize plants with foliar spray and seed treatment methods, resulting in 72-80% 
      and 50-60% colonization rates, respectively, 14 days after inoculation. The EPF 
      negatively impacted the development and fecundity of S. frugiperda. Larvae 
      feeding on EPF-inoculated leaves had slower development (21.21 d for M. 
      anisopliae and 20.64 d for B. bassiana) than the control treatment (20.27 d). The 
      fecundity rate was also significantly reduced to 260.0-290.1 eggs/female with 
      both EPF applications compared with the control treatment (435.6 eggs/female). 
      Age-stage-specific parameters showed lower fecundity, life expectancy, and 
      survival of S. frugiperda when they fed on both EPF-inoculated leaves compared 
      with untreated leaves. Furthermore, both EPFs had a significant effect on 
      population parameters such as intrinsic (r = 0.127 d(-1) for B. bassiana, and r = 
      0.125 d(-1) for M. anisopliae) and finite rate (lambda = 1.135 d(-1) for B. bassiana, 
      and lambda = 1.1333 d(-1) for M. anisopliae) of S. frugiperda compared with the 
      control (r = 0.133 d(-1) and lambda = 1.146 d(-1)). These findings suggest that EPF 
      can be effectively used for the endophytic colonization of maize plants to 
      control S. frugiperda. Therefore, these EPFs should be integrated into pest 
      management programs for this pest.

TI  - Synthesis, Characterization and Biological Activities of Zinc Oxide Nanoparticles 
      Derived from Secondary Metabolites of Lentinula edodes.
LID - 10.3390/molecules28083532 [doi]
LID - 3532
AB  - Zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) are the second most prevalent metal oxide, 
      owing to their characteristics of low cost, safe, and easily prepared. ZnO NPs 
      have been found to exhibit unique properties which show their potential to be 
      used in various therapies. Numerous techniques have been devised for the 
      manufacture of zinc oxide because it is one of the nanomaterials that has 
      received major research interest. Mushroom sources are proven to be efficient, 
      ecologically friendly, inexpensive, and safe for humankind. In the current study, 
      an aqueous fraction of methanolic extract of Lentinula edodes (L. edoes) was used 
      to synthesize ZnO NPs. The biosynthesis of ZnO NPs was achieved by using the 
      reducing and capping capability of an L. edodes aqueous fraction. Bioactive 
      compounds from mushroom, such as flavonoids and polyphenolic compounds, are used 
      in the green synthesis process to biologically reduce metal ions or metal oxides 
      to metal NPs. Biogenically synthesized ZnO NPs were further characterized by 
      using UV-Vis, FTIR, HPLC, XRD, SEM, EDX, zeta sizer and zeta potential analyses. 
      The FTIR showed the functional group at the spectra in the range 3550-3200 cm(-1) 
      indicated the presence of the hydroxyl (OH) group, while bands in the range 
      1720-1706 cm(-1) indicated C=O carboxylic stretches bonds. Furthermore, the XRD 
      pattern of ZnO NPs created in the current study was found to be nanocrystals 
      which are hexagonal. The SEM analysis of ZnO NPs showed spherical shapes and size 
      distributions in the range 90-148 nm. Biologically synthesized ZnO NPs have 
      substantial biological activities including antioxidant, antimicrobial, 
      antipyretic, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory potential. Biological activities 
      showed significant antioxidant (65.7 +/- 1.09), antidiabetic (85.18 +/- 0.48), and 
      anti-inflammatory potential (86.45 +/- 0.60) at 300 microg inhibition in paw 
      inflammation of (1.1 +/- 0.06) and yeast-induced pyrexia (97.4 +/- 0.51) at 10 mg in 
      a dose-dependent manner. The outcomes of this research indicated that ZnO NPs 
      significantly reduced inflammation and have the ability to scavenge free radicals 
      and prevent protein denaturation, while also indicating their possible use in 
      food and nutraceutical applications to treat various ailments.

      aptamer-functionalized microparticles.
PG  - 024105

AB  - Microfluidic liquid biopsy has emerged as a promising clinical assay for early 
      diagnosis. Herein, we propose acoustofluidic separation of biomarker proteins 
      from platelets in plasma using aptamer-functionalized microparticles. As model 
      proteins, C-reactive protein and thrombin were spiked in human platelet-rich 
      plasma. The target proteins were selectively conjugated with their corresponding 
      aptamer-functionalized microparticles of different sizes, and the particle 
      complexes served as a mobile carrier for the conjugated proteins. The proposed 
      acoustofluidic device was composed of an interdigital transducer (IDT) patterned 
      on a piezoelectric substrate and a disposable polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 
      microfluidic chip. The PDMS chip was placed in a tilted arrangement with the IDT 
      to utilize both vertical and horizontal components of surface acoustic 
      wave-induced acoustic radiation force (ARF) for multiplexed assay at 
      high-throughput. The two different-sized particles experienced the ARF at 
      different magnitudes and were separated from platelets in plasma. The IDT on the 
      piezoelectric substrate could be reusable, while the microfluidic chip can be 
      replaceable for repeated assays. The sample processing throughput with the 
      separation efficiency >95% has been improved such that the volumetric flow rate 
      and flow velocity were 1.6 ml/h and 37 mm/s, respectively. For the prevention of 
      platelet activation and protein adsorption to the microchannel, polyethylene 
      oxide solution was introduced as sheath flows and coating on to the walls. We 
      conducted scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoemission spectroscopy , and 
      sodium dodecyl sulfate- analysis before and after the separation to confirm the 
      protein capture and separation. We expect that the proposed approach will provide 
      new prospects for particle-based liquid biopsy using blood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying practice-ready evidence-based journal articles in 
      medicine is a challenge due to the sheer volume of biomedical research 
      publications. Newer approaches to support evidence discovery apply deep learning 
      techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of classifying sound evidence. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine how well deep learning models using variants of 
      Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) identify 
      high-quality evidence with high clinical relevance from the biomedical literature 
      for consideration in clinical practice. METHODS: We fine-tuned variations of BERT 
      models (BERT(BASE), BioBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT) and compared their 
      performance in classifying articles based on methodological quality criteria. The 
      dataset used for fine-tuning models included titles and abstracts of >160,000 
      PubMed records from 2012 to 2020 that were of interest to human health which had 
      been manually labeled based on meeting established critical appraisal criteria 
      for methodological rigor. The data was randomly divided into 80:10:10 sets for 
      training, validating, and testing. In addition to using the full unbalanced set, 
      the training data was randomly undersampled into four balanced datasets to assess 
      performance and select the best performing model. For each of the four sets, one 
      model that maintained sensitivity (recall) at >/=99% was selected and were 
      ensembled. The best performing model was evaluated in a prospective, blinded test 
      and applied to an established reference standard, the Clinical Hedges dataset. 
      RESULTS: In training, three of the four selected best performing models were 
      trained using BioBERT(BASE). The ensembled model did not boost performance 
      compared with the best individual model. Hence a solo BioBERT-based model (named 
      DL-PLUS) was selected for further testing as it was computationally more 
      efficient. The model had high recall (>99%) and 60% to 77% specificity in a 
      prospective evaluation conducted with blinded research associates and saved >60% 
      of the work required to identify high quality articles. CONCLUSIONS: Deep 
      learning using pretrained language models and a large dataset of classified 
      articles produced models with improved specificity while maintaining >99% recall. 
      The resulting DL-PLUS model identifies high-quality, clinically relevant articles 
      from PubMed at the time of publication. The model improves the efficiency of a 
      literature surveillance program, which allows for faster dissemination of 
      appraised research.

AB  - Blunt aortic injury (BAI) as a result of thoracic trauma is a rare entity in the 
      adult and pediatric population. The endovascular approach has been the preferred 
      method of management over operative repair in adults. However, data on pediatrics 
      is limited to case reports and case series with no long-term follow-up. There are 
      no current guidelines for management in the pediatric population. We are 
      reporting a successful repair of a traumatic thoracic aortic aneurysm in a 
      13 year old boy with covered stents, with a review of relevant literature.

TI  - Mean level of pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in patients with 
      squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck-Cross-sectional study.
PG  - e15894

AB  - BACKGROUND: Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck have been characterized 
      using various prognostic parameters. These include advanced age, lifestyle habits 
      such as smoking, higher tumor stage at presentation & presence of metastasis. 
      Many patients are diagnosed with head and neck cancers annually in Pakistan, but 
      limited data is available for the prognosis of these patients. This study aims to 
      investigate a new biomarker by estimating the mean level of pretreatment 
      neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in patients with Squamous cell carcinoma of 
      the head & neck. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using 
      non-probability consecutive sampling techniques for 222 biopsy-proven cases of 
      head & neck squamous cell carcinoma. Clinical & pathological variables were 
      analyzed, including the patient's profile and tumor characteristics. The NLR of 
      each patient before treatment was calculated using the absolute neutrophil count 
      divided by the absolute lymphocyte count in preoperative blood samples. An 
      independent sample t-test was used to assess the mean difference. A p-value less 
      than or equal to 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. RESULTS: Of 222 
      patients, a male predominance was seen in the entire cohort. A median 
      pretreatment NLR of 3.19 (2.47-4.97) was identified, and patients were classified 
      into high and low NLRs based on this value. Data analysis revealed a 
      statistically significant increase in NLR among patients with nodal metastasis. 
      In addition, patients with NLR above the median cutoff value of 3.19 demonstrated 
      that there was a significant increase in NLR values with high tumor (T) and nodal 
      (N) classifications with a p-value of 0.001 and 0.003, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Pretreatment neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio may be associated with increased 
      nodal involvement. It may serve as a useful prognostic predictor for patients 
      with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Identifying high-risk 
      patients in the pretreatment phase with the help of such biomarkers will also 
      facilitate early inclusion in clinical trials.

TI  - Multifunctional Zn(II) Coordination Polymer as Highly Selective Fluorescent 
      Sensor and Adsorbent for Dyes.
LID - 10.3390/ijms24108512 [doi]
LID - 8512
AB  - A new Zn(II)-based coordination polymer (1) comprising the Schiff base ligand 
      obtained by the condensation of 5-aminosalicylic acid and salicylaldehyde has 
      been synthesized. This newly synthesized compound has been characterized by 
      analytical and spectroscopic methods, and finally, by single-crystal X-ray 
      diffraction technique in this study. The X-ray analysis reveals a distorted 
      tetrahedral environment around the central Zn(II) center. This compound has been 
      used as a sensitive and selective fluorescent sensor for acetone and Ag(+) 
      cations. The photoluminescence measurements indicate that in the presence of 
      acetone, the emission intensity of 1 displays quenching at room temperature. 
      However, other organic solvents caused meagre changes in the emission intensity 
      of 1. Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of 1 has been examined in the 
      presence of different ketones viz. cyclohexanone, 4-heptanone, and 5-nonanone, to 
      assess the interaction between the C=O group of the ketones and the molecular 
      framework of 1. Moreover, 1 displays a selective recognition of Ag(+) in the 
      aqueous medium by an enhancement in its fluorescence intensity, representing its 
      high sensitivity for the detection of Ag(+) ions in a water sample. Additionally, 
      1 displays the selective adsorption of cationic dyes (methylene blue and 
      rhodamine B). Hence, 1 showcases its potential as an excellent luminescent probe 
      to detect acetone, other ketones, and Ag(+) with an exceptional selectivity, and 
      displaying a selective adsorption of cationic dye molecules.

TI  - Use of Balloon Occluded Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration (BRTO) for Treatment 
      of Gastric Varices: A Narrative Review.
PG  - e38233

AB  - Gastric Varices occur as a result of portal hypertension. Balloon Retrograde 
      Transvenous Obliteration (BRTO) is a modality for managing gastric varices. The 
      ultimate goal of this review is to promote the broader adoption of BRTO in 
      managing gastric varices and to promote further research to improve patient 
      outcomes. Before this study, an electronic literature search was undertaken based 
      on identified concepts, keywords, and other pertinent descriptions. Search 
      databases were developed and included "Gastric varices" AND "BRTO" OR 
      "intervention" OR "treatment" OR "procedure" OR "glue" OR "adhesive".  The 
      databases selected and thoroughly searched were PubMed, Cochrane Library and 
      ScienceDirect. Following the first search, 274 articles were found in total. By 
      applying inclusion criteria of full-text articles and a period of fewer than five 
      years, the database was reduced to 37 articles, which was then further filtered 
      to include only articles on adults over 19 years old, leaving a total count of 17 
      articles. BRTO is a relatively simple procedure to perform once the essential 
      skill is attained and helpful in both emergency and elective management of 
      gastric varices. Its use still needs to be improved by the unavailability and 
      lack of skills. However, there are side effects associated with BRTO as it causes 
      elevation of portal hypertension, recurrent bleeding, hemoglobinuria and pain 
      post procedure. This review emphasizes the need for further research in this 
      field, focusing on refining patient selection criteria, improving the technical 
      aspect of the procedure and enhancing long-term outcomes.

AB  - In the future, 8-10 billion people will need to be fed by our agriculture and 
      food production system. Moreover, currently up to five billion people are already 
      affected by malnutrition including undernutrition, inadequate consumption of 
      micronutrients, and overweight. A healthy and sustainable diet will therefore 
      play a pivotal role in our future, but most food products are traded and consumed 
      based only on techno-functional or gustatory properties. We wish to stimulate a 
      debate on the urgent need for multidisciplinary research and education to realize 
      future diets with enhanced nutritional profiles. In particular, there is a need 
      to better measure and understand the factors that influence the nutrients of food 
      products along the global supply chains.

TI  - Phytobioactive compounds as therapeutic agents for human diseases: A review.
PG  - 2500-2529
LID - 10.1002/fsn3.3308 [doi]
AB  - Phytobioactive compounds are plant secondary metabolites and bioactive compounds 
      abundantly present in medicinal plants and have remarkable therapeutic potential. 
      Oxidative stress and antibiotic resistance are major causes of present-day 
      ailments such as diabetes, atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disorders, cancer, and 
      inflammation. The data for this review were collected from Google Scholar, 
      PubMed, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), and Science Direct by using 
      keywords: "Medicinal plants, Phytobioactive compounds, Polyphenols, Alkaloids, 
      Carotenoids etc." Several studies have reported the pharmacological and 
      therapeutic potential of the phytobioactives. Polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, 
      and polysaccharides isolated from medicinal plants showed remarkable antioxidant, 
      anticancer, cytotoxic, anti-inflammatory, cardioprotective, hepatoprotective, 
      immunomodulatory, neuroprotective, and antidiabetic activities. This literature 
      review was planned to provide comprehensive insight into the biopharmacological 
      and therapeutic potential of phytobioactive compounds. The techniques used for 
      the extraction and isolation of phytobioactive compounds, and bioassays required 
      for their biological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, 
      anti-inflammatory, and cytotoxic activities, have been discussed. 
      Characterization techniques for the structural elucidation of phytobioactive 
      compounds such as HPLC, TLC, FTIR, GC-MS/MS, and NMR have also been discussed. 
      This review concludes that phytobioactive compounds may be used as potential 
      alternative to synthetic compounds as therapeutic agents for the treatment of 
      various diseases.

AB  - Drug delivery science is always an important topic as it studies the delivery of 
      therapeutic payloads to the desired target cells without affecting the healthy 
      tissues/cells, thus minimizing drug-induced toxicity. Aiming towards the targeted 
      drug delivery, the present project deals with the delivery of a 
      polarity-sensitive solvatochromic model drug, namely, salt of 
      8-anilinonaphthalene-1-sulphonic acid (ANSA) to the model bio-membrane (which 
      mimic several aspects of the real cell membrane), more precisely at the 
      lipid-water interface of L-alpha-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) phospholipid. 
      The drug delivery process has been activated through the binding of dye with 
      cyclodextrin, acting as a drug transporter. Detailed steady-state and 
      time-resolved spectroscopic studies including molecular docking analysis imply 
      the targeted drug delivery of dye, ANSA, towards the lipid-water interface region 
      of lipid bilayers through encapsulation within the cyclodextrin void. Stronger 
      binding interaction of the dye with the lipid bilayers relative to beta-cyclodextrin 
      (beta-CD) is the foremost reason for the targeted delivery. The present biophysical 
      interaction studies of drug-lipid interaction, thus, may provide a cordial 
      approach for drug formulation and drug delivery.

TI  - PD-L1 is Fascinating but IDO Needs Attention in Non-HCV and Non-HBV-Associated 
      Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients.
PG  - 921-934
LID - 10.2147/JHC.S409741 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common forms of 
      liver cancer that is modulated by the immune system. Programmed cell death 
      ligand-1 (PD-L1) has emerged as a novel therapeutic target in various cancers. 
      Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is an immunosuppressive enzyme that is 
      associated with poor prognoses in various cancer types. The aim of this study was 
      to investigate the PD-L1 expression, and clinicopathological features of non-HCV 
      and non-HBV-associated HCC patients, including IDO expression. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was performed to analyze the 
      expression of PD-L1 and IDO. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HCC tumor tissues 
      (n=50) were obtained from the pathology department, at Shaukat Khanum Memorial 
      Cancer Hospital and Research Centre (SKMCH&RC) in Lahore, Pakistan between 2005 
      and 2022. All the patients were HBV and HCV negative. Furthermore, it was a rare 
      group of patients with no previous history of any viral hepatitis. In addition, 
      for categorical and continuous variables chi-square or Fisher exact test and 
      Mann-Whitney U-test was performed. RESULTS: Of 50 tissue specimens, PD-L1+ was 
      observed in 21 [high: 12 (24%), low: 9 (18%)] and PD-L1- was observed in 29 HCC 
      patients. IDO+ was observed in all 50 specimens [high: 42 (84%), low: 8 (16%)]. 
      Additionally, both PD-L1 and IDO had high expression in 11 (22%) patients. While 
      both PD-L1 and IDO had low expression in 2 (4%) patients. Furthermore, in 
      IDO+/PD-L1- group, 20 (69%) out of 29 patients died while in the IDO+/PD-L1+ 
      group, 9 (43%) out of 21 patients died. CONCLUSION: Evaluation of IDO and PD-L1 
      expression may add therapeutic advantage in non-HCV and non-HBV-associated HCC 
      patients that overexpress IDO. Further validation in a larger cohort is 
      warranted.

TI  - A Comprehensive Review of miRNAs and Their Epigenetic Effects in Glioblastoma.
LID - 10.3390/cells12121578 [doi]
LID - 1578
AB  - Glioblastoma is the most aggressive form of brain tumor originating from glial 
      cells with a maximum life expectancy of 14.6 months. Despite the establishment of 
      multiple promising therapies, the clinical outcome of glioblastoma patients is 
      abysmal. Drug resistance has been identified as a major factor contributing to 
      the failure of current multimodal therapy. Epigenetic modification, especially 
      DNA methylation has been identified as a major regulatory mechanism behind 
      glioblastoma progression. In addition, miRNAs, a class of non-coding RNA, have 
      been found to play a role in the regulation as well as in the diagnosis of 
      glioblastoma. The relationship between epigenetics, drug resistance, and 
      glioblastoma progression has been clearly demonstrated. MGMT hypermethylation, 
      leading to a lack of MGMT expression, is associated with a cytotoxic effect of 
      TMZ in GBM, while resistance to TMZ frequently appears in MGMT non-methylated 
      GBM. In this review, we will elaborate on known miRNAs linked to glioblastoma; 
      their distinctive oncogenic or tumor suppressor roles; and how epigenetic 
      modification of miRNAs, particularly via methylation, leads to their upregulation 
      or downregulation in glioblastoma. Moreover, we will try to identify those miRNAs 
      that might be potential regulators of MGMT expression and their role as 
      predictors of tumor response to temozolomide treatment. Although we do not impact 
      clinical data and survival, we open possible experimental approaches to treat 
      GBM, although they should be further validated with clinically oriented studies.

AB  - Medicinal plants have been extensively exploited for their immense 
      pharmacological and immune-supporting potential. Fruit of Citrullus colocynthis 
      has several active secondary metabolites such as phenolics, flavonoids, and 
      essential oils that are used in traditional medicines as antidiabetic, 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial agents. In this study, 
      phytoconstituents in organic fractions (n-hexane, chloroform, and ethyl acetate) 
      of the methanolic extract of C. colocynthis were analyzed and identified by 
      FT-IR, HPLC, and GC-MS analysis. Ethyl acetate fraction showed the highest 
      antioxidant scavenging (76 +/- .769%) and anti-inflammatory (40 +/- .473%) activities 
      at the concentration of 3 mg/mL. Similarly, antidiabetic effect was measured by 
      inhibition of alpha-amylase where, ethyl acetate fraction (77 +/- .844%) exhibited the 
      highest antidiabetic activity. Among all organic fractions, ethyl acetate 
      exhibited strong antimicrobial potential followed by n-hexane and chloroform 
      fractions against selected pathogenic bacteria. Various concentrations of the 
      ethyl acetate extract were tested in-vivo for cytotoxicity and results indicated 
      minor morphological changes in liver cells including ballooning, fatty droplets, 
      and slight accumulation of extracellular matrix even at concentrations of 
      400 mg/kg. In-silico study showed that stigmasta-7,16-dien-3-ol had a strong 
      interaction with COX-1 and COX-2 to reduce inflammation. The abovementioned 
      results indicate the pharmacological strengths of C. colocynthis to fight several 
      diseases.

AB  - Extensive fumigation of synthetic pesticides to control the mosquito vector 
      during each post-monsoon season in Pakistan significantly enhanced the 
      environmental contamination and extinction of beneficial insects from the urban 
      ecosystems. In this context, the present study examined the larvicidal efficacy 
      of green synthesized iron nanoparticles (IONPs), using an aqueous leaf extract of 
      Grevillea robusta against the early 2nd and 4th instar larvae of Aedes aegypti 
      and Anopheles stephensi in Pakistan. The prepared IONPs were characterized by 
      UV-Vis spectrum, FTIR, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and 
      energy-dispersive diffraction. Larvicidal bioassay was conducted at various 
      concentrations (80, 160, 240, 320, and 400 ppm) of IONPs prepared from leaf 
      extract of G. robusta, and readings were taken-every 12 h for two consecutive 
      days. In vitro, larvicidal assay, G. robusta leaf extract IONPs exhibited high 
      mortalities of 64-96% (LC(50) = 259.07 ppm; LC(90) = 443.92 ppm) for the second 
      instar and 65-98% (LC(50) = 238.05 ppm; LC(90) = 433.93 ppm) for the fourth 
      instar of Ae. aegypti, while in the case of An. stephensi 56-84% 
      (LC(50) = 297.96 ppm; LC(90) = 528.69 ppm) for the second and 56-88% 
      (LC(50) = 292.72 ppm; LC(90) = 514.00 ppm) mortality for fourth larvae at 12-48 h 
      post-exposure times were observed respectively. Significant (p < 0.05) 
      dose-dependent and exposure time-dependent trends were observed among the 2nd and 
      4th larvalinstar of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti. However, both species showed 
      similar response and observed no significant (p > 0.05) difference in percentage 
      mortality between the vector mosquitoes An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti. Overall, 
      this study demonstrates that the larvicidal efficacy of green synthesized IONPs 
      at low concentrations can be an ideal eco-friendly and cost-effective biocontrol 
      of vector mosquitoes' larvae of An. stephensi and Ae. aegypti.

AB  - Contamination of aquatic ecosystems with organic and inorganic contaminants is a 
      global threat due to their hazardous effects on the environment and human health. 
      Floating treatment wetland (FTW) technology is a cost-effective and sustainable 
      alternative to existing treatment approaches. It consists of a buoyant mat in 
      which wetland plants can grow and develop their roots in a suspended manner and 
      can be implemented to treat stormwater, municipal wastewater, and industrial 
      effluents. Here we explored the potential of bacterial-augmented FTWs for the 
      concurrent remediation of phenol and hexavalent chromium (Cr(6+)) contaminated 
      water and evaluated treated water toxicity using Triticum aestivum L. (wheat) as 
      a test plant. The FTWs carrying Phragmites australis L. (common reed) were 
      inoculated with a consortium of four bacterial strains (Burkholderia phytofirmans 
      PsJN, Acinetobacter lwofii ACRH76, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PJRS20, Bacillus sp. 
      PJRS25) and evaluated for their potential to simultaneously remove phenol and 
      chromium (Cr) from contaminated water. Results revealed that the FTWs efficiently 
      improved water quality by removing phenol (86%) and Cr (80%), with combined use 
      of P. australis and bacterial consortium after 50 days. The phytotoxicity assay 
      demonstrated that the germination of wheat seed (96%) was significantly higher 
      where bacterial-augmented FTWs treated water was used compared to untreated 
      water. This pilot-scale study highlights that the combined application of wetland 
      plants and bacterial consortium in FTWs is a promising approach for concomitant 
      abatement of phenol and Cr from contaminated water, especially for developing 
      countries like Pakistan where the application of advanced and expensive 
      technologies is limited.

AB  - Obesity has long been linked to adverse health effects over time. As the 
      prevalence of obesity continues to rise, it is important to anticipate and 
      minimize the complications that obesity brings in the anesthesia setting during 
      surgery. Anesthetic departments must recognize the innumerable risks when 
      managing patients with obesity undergoing surgery, including anatomical and 
      physiological changes as well as comorbidities such as diabetes, cardiovascular 
      diseases, and malignancies. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to analyze 
      the current literature and evaluate the current and recent advances in anesthetic 
      care of obese patients undergoing surgery, to better understand the specific 
      challenges this patient population faces. A greater understanding of the 
      differences between anesthetic care for obese patients can help to improve 
      patient care and the specificity of treatment. The examination of the literature 
      will focus on differing patient outcomes and safety precautions in obese patients

AB  - KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: An underlying autoimmune condition should be suspected in 
      patients who presented with periodic muscular weakness secondary to distal RTA 
      that leads to hypokalemia because distal RTA is commonly associated with 
      autoimmune disorders such as Sjogren's syndrome. ABSTRACT: A 22-year-old female 
      presented with a sudden onset of bilateral weakness in both upper and lower 
      limbs. The patient had a history of muscular weakness secondary to hypokalemia 
      and dryness of the eyes for the last 3 years. Laboratory investigations revealed 
      decreased potassium and metabolic acidosis. Further investigations confirmed 
      distal renal tubular acidosis (RTA) and Sjogren's syndrome. A diagnosis of distal 
      RTA secondary to Sjogren's syndrome was made. Her potassium levels were replaced, 
      and she was discharged with oral potassium supplements, steroids, and artificial 
      tears.

TI  - In-vivo anticoccidial efficacy of green synthesized iron-oxide nanoparticles

      infection in broiler chicks.

AB  - Coccidiosis is an acute gastrointestinal parasitic disease and causes 
      approximately $2.80 to $3.27 per m(2) loss in a broiler farm of a 33-day-old 
      flock. In this study, iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) were green synthesized 
      using the aqueous leaf extract of Ficus racemosa as a reducing and capping agent 
      to reduce the emerging resistance in coccidia spores against conventional 
      treatments and boost the immune level in broilers. These IONPs were evaluated for 
      their impacts on the growth performance, biochemistry, blood profile, and 
      histology in the coccidiodized broiler chicken with Emeria tenella under in vivo 
      conditions. The characteristics and stability of particles were obtained using 
      UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR), X-Ray diffraction (XRD), 
      energy dispersive X-ray absorption (EDX), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 
      zeta potential and zeta size. The results indicated that IONPs at the moderate 
      dose of 15 mg/kg (p = 0.001) reduced the coccidial impacts by eliminating oocyst 
      shedding per gram feces (up to 91%) and reducing clinical symptoms (lesions (LS = 
      0), bloody diarrhea (No), and mortality (0%) in chicken at day 10 of treatment as 
      compared to the negative control group-B (infected & non-treated). A 
      dose-dependent and time-dependent trend were observed during treatments (10, 15, 
      and 20 mg/kg) of 1-3 weeks using IONPs against the coccidial impacts on the 
      growth parameters (body weight gain, mean feed consumption, feed conversion 
      ratio) and biochemistry (plasma glucose, total protein, uric acid, ALT, AST, and 
      ALP) in chickens. Additionally, F. racemosa IONPs at a dose of 15 and 20 mg/kg 
      significantly recovered the parasitized and highly damaged hepatocytes, liver 
      tissues, and ceca tissues after 1-3 weeks of treatment in broiler chickens. 
      Overall, the 15 mg/kg concentration of IONPs exhibited fast recovery and growth 
      enhancement in coccidiodized broilers. Therefore, the 15 mg/kg dose of green 
      synthesized IONPs using leaf extract of F. racemosa could be a potential and safe 
      anticoccidial agent with targeted implications in the poultry industry.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS) also known as Laurence-Moon-Bardet-Biedl 
      syndrome one of the rarely reported genetic disorder characterized by an 
      intellectual disability, limb, kidney abnormalities, obesity, and Rod-cone 
      dystrophy. Other associated condition includes diabetes mellitus, hypertension, 
      hypogonadism, facial dysmorphism, and congenital heart defects. This case 
      highlights megaloblastic anemia associated with BBS. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      16-year-old female patient who had a moon face, truncal obesity, polydactyly, low 
      IQ, and visual impairment presented with the complaint of shortness of breath and 
      easy fatiguability. She had bilateral retinal pigmentosa in her eyes and her 
      laboratory evaluation and bone marrow biopsy revealed megaloblastic anemia 
      secondary to vitamin B12 deficiency. She received injectable vitamin B12, folate, 
      and red cell contrate transfusion. Her symptoms improved and she was discharged 
      with oral medication. CONCLUSION: Megaloblastic anemia in BBS is rarely reported, 
      further research is needed to find the exact cause that is necessary for proper 
      management and better outcome.

TI  - Acoustic scattering in lined panel cavities with membrane interfaces.
PG  - 1138-1151
LID - 10.1121/10.0020724 [doi]
AB  - Noise control strategies are extremely important in industry. Acoustic liners and 
      elastic membranes, which absorb or attenuate sound waves, are key components in 
      ducting systems for active and passive noise reduction. In this article, we 
      design and examine a reactive liner panel cavity with flexible interfaces. The 
      lined panel cavity system is comprised of elastic membranes at the interfaces. 
      The aim is to couple the incoming duct modes with the flexible components and 
      then with the localized modes in the lined region. The governing equations for 
      the lined panel cavity system are solved using a mode-matching technique that 
      assures continuity of the normal velocities at the interfaces and can handle a 
      range of strong coupling and higher-order edge conditions in contrast to the 
      coupled mode theory. The aim is to investigate the effects of reactive liners and 
      elastic membrane interfaces on wave scattering through the proposed acoustic 
      enclosure design. The scattering performance of the proposed lined panel cavity 
      is evaluated in terms of the reflected and transmitted energy flux as well as 
      transmission loss. Analysis shows that the resonances at the membrane interfaces 
      coupled to the linear cavities have a direct impact on power variations and the 
      maximum transmission loss.

AB  - Jugular vein phlebectasia is seen in the first decade of life and carries a high 
      chance of misdiagnosis as it can often be mistaken for other conditions observed 
      in pediatric populations. High clinical suspicion along with radiological studies 
      can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is usually conservative, with 
      surgery reserved for unique circumstances. This is the first case to be reported 
      with concomitant tracheomalacia and a history of tracheoesophageal fistula repair 
      in a pediatric patient with external jugular vein phlebectasia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Considering the threats in the operating room during the COVID-19 
      pandemic, the optimal care and safety of the operating room nurses should be 
      maintained when performing surgery on an acute respiratory patient. It seems 
      necessary to design a tool to measure the caring behaviors of operating room 
      nurses. Therefore, the present study was conducted with the aim to design a valid 
      and reliable tool for measuring the caring behavior of operating room nurses 
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this sequential, 
      exploratory, mixed-method study, the designing and psychometric evaluation of the 
      caring behaviors of operating room nurses questionnaire during the COVID-19 
      pandemic were performed in qualitative and quantitative phases from August 2021 
      to July 2022 in Aja University of Medical Sciences, Iran. In the qualitative 
      phase, the concept of caring behaviors of operating room nurses was explored 
      through interviews and a literature review based on online searches. In the 
      quantitative phase, validity (face, content, and construct), and reliability of 
      the questionnaire were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings supported 21 items in the 
      5 factors of caring behaviors related to attitude toward patients, knowledge of 
      surgical care, virus prevention principles, self-care knowledge, and self-care 
      performance, which explained 35.92 of the total variance. Scale-Content Validity 
      Index/Average and Cronbach's alpha were calculated to be 0.93 and 0.89, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Given its desirable reliability and validity, simple 
      scoring, and ease of use by operating room nurses, the Caring Behaviors of 
      Operating Room Nurses Questionnaire is applicable and its use is recommended.

AB  - Residual antibiotics have become emerging contaminants of concern for their 
      adverse impact on the ecosystem. Additionally, their accumulation in the 
      environment is increasing antibiotic resistance among pathogens. This study 
      assessed the impact of intensification of biochar, nutrients, aeration, and 
      bacteria (BNAB) on the remediation potential of floating treatment wetlands 
      (FTWs) to treat amoxicillin (AMX)-contaminated water. The FTWs were developed 
      with saplings of Vetiveria zizanioides and intensified with biochar (1.5%), 
      nutrients (25 mgL(-1) N, 25 mgL(-1) P, 20 mg L(1) K), aeration (7 mg L(-1)), and 
      AMX-degrading bacteria. The results showed that all the amendments enhanced the 
      AMX degradation, while the maximum reduction in COD (89%), BOD (88%), TOC (87%), 
      and AMX (97%) was shown by the combined application of all the amendments. The 
      combined application also enhanced plant growth and persistence of the inoculated 
      bacteria in the water, roots, and shoots. This approach can be employed for the 
      low-cost, environment-friendly treatment, and recycling of 
      antibiotic-contaminated wastewater, where BNAB intensification can further 
      improve the bioremediation efficiency of FTWs in the case of heavily polluted 
      waters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The usage of immunotherapy to treat skin malignancies in transplant 
      patients requires weighing the risk of acute organ transplant rejection with the 
      potential reduction of antitumor efficacy by transplant immunosuppression. 
      Reducing the duration of immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment may help prevent 
      acute transplant rejection and late immune-related adverse events. CASE 
      PRESENTATION: An allogenic kidney transplant patient who developed regionally 
      metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma received four cycles of 
      pembrolizumab with complete response to therapy. Therapy was discontinued due to 
      fatigue, significant cancer response, and to reduce the risk of acute graft 
      rejection. His renal function remained stable, and he achieved subsequent durable 
      response after treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION: Organ transplant recipients 
      with complete response to immunotherapy for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma may 
      continue to respond despite early treatment cessation. This may reduce the risks 
      of late immune-related adverse events and acute graft rejection.

TI  - Homozygous Mutations in Thyroid Peroxidase (TPO) in Hypothyroidism with 
      Intellectual Disability, Developmental Delay, and Hearing and Ocular Anomalies in 
      Two Families: Severe Manifestation of Untreated TPO-deficiency Poses a Diagnostic 
      Dilemma.
PG  - 347-365
LID - 10.59249/SSRG6507 [doi]
AB  - Intellectual disability (ID) involves compromised intellectual, learning and 
      cognitive skills, and behavioral capabilities with reduced psychomotor skills. 
      One of the preventable causes of ID is congenital hypothyroidism (CH), which may 
      be due to biallelic mutations in thyroid peroxidase (TPO). In low- and 
      middle-income countries with no newborn screening programs, CH poses a great risk 
      of ID and long-term morbidity. We report two large Pakistani families with a 
      total of 16 patients afflicted with CH. Detailed clinical and behavioral 
      assessments, SNP-based homozygosity mapping, linkage analysis, and exome 
      sequencing were performed. Initially, affected individuals were referred as 
      suffering ID (in 11 of 16 patients) and developmental delay (in 14). 
      Secondary/associated features were verbal apraxia (in 13), goiter (in 12), short 
      stature (in 11), limb hypotonia (in 14), no pubertal onset (five of 10 of age >/=14 
      years), high myopia (in eight), muscle cramps (in six), and in some, variable 
      microcephaly and enuresis/encopresis, fits, chronic fatigue, and other behavioral 
      symptoms, which are not characteristics of CH. Molecular genetic analyses led to 
      the discovery of homozygous variants in TPO: novel missense variant c.719A>G 
      (p.Asp240Gly) in family 1 and rare c.2315A>G (p.Tyr772Cys) in family 2. In 
      low-resource countries where neonatal screening programs do not include a CH 
      test, the burden of neurodevelopmental disorders is likely to be increased due to 
      untreated CH. Secondly, in the background of the high prevalence of recessive 
      disorders due to high parental consanguinity, the severe manifestation of 
      TPO-deficiency mimics a wide range of neurological and other presentations posing 
      a diagnostic dilemma.

AB  - The signaling of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) 
      regulates various diseases, including multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, 
      rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation-related ailments, diabetes, and cancer. SphK1 
      is considered an attractive potential drug target and is extensively explored in 
      cancer and other inflammatory diseases. In this study, we have investigated the 
      inhibitory potential and binding affinity of SphK1 with cholic acid (CA), 
      syringic acid (SA), and mangiferin (MF) using a combination of docking and 
      molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies followed by experimental measurements 
      of binding affinity and enzyme inhibition assays. We observed these compounds 
      bind to SphK1 with a significantly high affinity and eventually inhibit its 
      kinase activity with IC(50) values of 28.23 muM, 33.35 muM, and 57.2 muM for CA, SA, 
      and MF, respectively. Further, the docking and 100 ns MD simulation studies 
      showed that CA, SA, and MF bind with the active site residues of SphK1 with 
      favorable energy and strong non-covalent interactions that might be accountable 
      for inhibiting its kinase activity. Our finding indicates that CA, SA, and MF may 
      be implicated in designing novel anti-cancer therapeutics with an improved 
      affinity and lesser side effects by targeting SphK1.

TI  - Enhancing the Performance of the p-n Heterostructure Electrolyte for Solid Oxide 
      Fuel Cells via A-Site-Deficiency Engineering.
PG  - 49154-49169

AB  - Semiconductor ionic electrolytes are attracting growing interest for developing 
      low-temperature solid oxide fuel cells (LT-SOFCs). Our recent study has proposed 
      a p-n heterostructure electrolyte based on perovskite oxide 
      BaCo(0.4)Fe(0.4)Zr(0.1)Y(0.1)O(3-delta) (BCFZY) and ZnO, achieving promising fuel 
      cell performance. Herein, to further improve the performance of the 
      heterostructure electrolyte, an A-site-deficiency strategy is used to solely 
      modify BCFZY for regulating the ionic conduction and catalytic activity of the 
      heterostructure. Two new electrolytes, B(0.9)CFZY-ZnO and B(0.8)CFZY-ZnO, were 
      developed and systematically studied. The results show that the two samples gain 
      improved ionic conductivity and auxiliary catalytic activity after A-site 
      deficiency as a result of the increment of the surface and interface oxygen 
      vacancies. The single cells with B(0.9)CFZY-ZnO and B(0.8)CFZY-ZnO exhibit 
      enhanced peak power outputs at 450-550  degrees C compared to the cell based on 
      B(1.0)CFZY-ZnO (typically, 745 and 795 vs 542 mW cm(-2) at 550  degrees C). Particular 
      attention is paid to the impact of A-site deficiency on the interface energy band 
      alignment between B(x)CFZY and ZnO, which suggests that the p-n heterojunction 
      effect of B(x)CFZY-ZnO for charge carrier regulation can be tuned by A-site 
      deficiency to enable high proton transport while avoiding fuel cell current 
      leakage. This study thus confirms the feasibility of A-site-deficiency 
      engineering to optimize the performance of the heterostructure electrolyte for 
      developing LT-SOFCs.

TI  - Metagenomic Approach Deciphers the Role of Community Composition of Mycobiome 
      Structured by Bacillus velezensis VB7 and Trichoderma koningiopsis TK in Tomato 
      Rhizosphere to Suppress Root-Knot Nematode Infecting Tomato.

AB  - The soil microbiome is crucial for maintaining the sustainability of the 
      agricultural environment. Concerning the role of diverse mycobiomes and their 
      abundance toward the suppression of root-knot nematode (RKN) infection in 
      vegetable crops, our understanding is unclear. To unveil this issue, we examined 
      the fungal microbiome in tomato rhizosphere augmented with bioagents challenged 
      against RKN at taxonomic and functional levels. Composition of the mycobiome in 
      tomato rhizosphere treated with Bacillus velezensis VB7 and Trichoderma 
      koningiopsis TK differed significantly from the infected tomato rhizosphere. The 
      abundance and diversity of fungal species, however, were significantly higher in 
      the combined treatments of bioagents than for individual treatments. Fungal 
      microbiome diversity was negatively correlated in the RKN-associated soil. 
      Network analysis of the fungal biome indicated a larger and complex network of 
      fungal biome diversity in bioagent-treated soil than in nematode-associated 
      tomato rhizosphere. The diversity index represented by that challenging the RKN 
      by drenching with consortia of B. velezensis VB7 and T. koningiopsis TK, or 
      applying them individually, constituted the maximum abundance and richness of the 
      mycobiome compared to the untreated control. Thus, the increased diverse nature 
      and relative abundance of the mycobiome in tomato rhizosphere was mediated 
      through the application of either T. koningiopsis TK or B. velezensis VB7, 
      individually or as a consortium comprising both fungal and bacterial antagonists, 
      which facilitated engineering the community composition of fungal bioagents. This 
      in turn inhibited the infestation of RKN in tomato. It would be interesting to 
      explore further the possibility of combined applications of B. velezensis VB7 and 
      T. koningiopsis TK to manage root-knot nematodes as an integrated approach for 
      managing plant parasitic nematodes at the field level.

TI  - Mineral Solubilizing Rhizobacterial Strains Mediated Biostimulation of Rhodes 
      Grass Seedlings.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms11102543 [doi]
LID - 2543
AB  - Minerals play a dynamic role in plant growth and development. However, most of 
      these mineral nutrients are unavailable to plants due to their presence in fixed 
      forms, which causes significant losses in crop production. An effective strategy 
      to overcome this challenge is using mineral solubilizing bacteria, which can 
      convert insoluble forms of minerals into soluble ones that plants can quickly 
      assimilate, thus enhancing their availability in nutrient-depleted soils. The 
      main objective of the present study was to isolate and characterize mineral 
      solubilizing rhizobacteria and to assess their plant growth-promoting potential 
      for Rhodes grass. Twenty-five rhizobacterial strains were isolated on a nutrient 
      agar medium. They were characterized for solubilization of insoluble minerals 
      (phosphate, potassium, zinc, and manganese), indole acetic acid production, 
      enzymatic activities, and various morphological traits. The selected strains were 
      also evaluated for their potential to promote the growth of Rhodes grass 
      seedlings. Among tested strains, eight strains demonstrated strong qualitative 
      and quantitative solubilization of insoluble phosphate. Strain MS2 reported the 
      highest phosphate solubilization index, phosphate solubilization efficiency, 
      available phosphorus concentration, and reduction in medium pH. Among tested 
      strains, 75% were positive for zinc and manganese solubilization, and 37.5% were 
      positive for potassium solubilization. Strain MS2 demonstrated the highest 
      quantitative manganese solubilization, while strains MS7 and SM4 reported the 
      highest solubilization of zinc and potassium through acidifying their respective 
      media. The strain SM4 demonstrated the most increased IAA production in the 
      presence and absence of L-tryptophan. The majority of strains were positive for 
      various enzymes, including urease, catalase protease, and amylase activities. 
      However, these strains were negative for coagulase activity except strains SM7 
      and MS7. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, six strains, namely, SM2, SM4, SM5, 
      MS1, MS2, and MS4, were identified as Bacillus cereus, while strains SM7 and MS7 
      were identified as Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. 
      These strains significantly improved growth attributes of Rhodes grass, such as 
      root length, shoot length, and root and shoot fresh and dry biomasses compared to 
      the uninoculated control group. The present study highlights the significance of 
      mineral solubilizing and enzyme-producing rhizobacterial strains as potential 
      bioinoculants to enhance Rhodes grass growth under mineral-deficient conditions 
      sustainably.

TI  - A Case Report of Necrotizing Fasciitis Managed With the Application of Negative 
      Pressure Wound Therapy to Achieve Better Wound Closure.

AB  - Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection of 
      the soft tissues that involves the skin, subcutaneous fat, fascia, and muscle. It 
      can rapidly spread and lead to tissue death, sepsis, toxic shock syndrome, 
      cardiopulmonary failure, and even death, especially in patients with chronic 
      diseases, immunocompromised status, or immobility. To control the spread of 
      necrosis, prompt diagnosis and aggressive surgical intervention with radical 
      debridement of the affected tissues are essential, along with the administration 
      of broad-spectrum antibiotics and intensive care support, when required. The 
      application of negative pressure wound therapy has been utilized in the 
      management of acute and complicated wounds with good outcomes. Here, we present a 
      case of an 82-year-old female who presented with fever, tachycardia, and 
      hypotension with underlying comorbid conditions of diabetes mellitus, 
      hypertension, and spinal stenosis. On further exploration, she was found to have 
      necrotizing fasciitis involving the left gluteal region. The present article 
      describes the use of a vacuum-assisted closure dressing as an adjunct to serial 
      debridement in the treatment of severe necrotizing fasciitis.

PG  - e46152
LID - 10.7759/cureus.46152 [doi]
LID - e46152
AB  - Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a clinical 
      syndrome in which patients have signs and symptoms of HF due to high left 
      ventricular (LV) filling pressure despite normal or near normal LV ejection 
      fraction. It is more common than HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and 
      its diagnosis and treatment are more challenging than HFrEF. Although 
      hypertension is the primary risk factor, coronary artery disease and other 
      comorbidities, such as atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes, chronic kidney disease 
      (CKD), and obesity, also play an essential role in its formation. This review 
      summarizes current knowledge about HFpEF, its pathophysiology, clinical 
      presentation, diagnostic challenges, current treatments, and promising novel 
      treatments. It is essential to continue to be updated on the latest treatments 
      for HFpEF so that patients always receive the most therapeutic treatments. The 
      use of GnRH agonists in the management of HFpEF, infusion of Apo a-I 
      nanoparticle, low-level transcutaneous vagal stimulation (LLTS), and estrogen 
      only in post-menopausal women are promising strategies to prevent diastolic 
      dysfunction and HFpEF; however, there is still no proven curative treatment for 
      HFpEF yet.

AB  - Hantaviruses are a significant and emerging global public health threat, 
      impacting more than 200,000 individuals worldwide each year. The single-stranded 
      RNA viruses belong to the Hantaviridae family and are responsible for causing two 
      acute febrile diseases in humans: Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and 
      hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Currently, there are no licensed 
      treatments or vaccines available globally for HTNV infection. Various candidate 
      drugs have shown efficacy in increasing survival rates during the early stages of 
      HTNV infection. Some of these drugs include lactoferrin, ribavirin, ETAR, 
      favipiravir and vandetanib. Immunotherapy utilizing neutralizing antibodies 
      (NAbs) generated from Hantavirus convalescent patients show efficacy against 
      HTNV. Monoclonal antibodies such as MIB22 and JL16 have demonstrated 
      effectiveness in protecting against HTNV infection. The development of vaccines 
      and antivirals, used independently and/or in combination, is critical for 
      elucidating hantaviral infections and the impact on public health. RNA 
      interference (RNAi) arised as an emerging antiviral therapy, is a highly specific 
      degrades RNA, with post-transcriptional mechanism using eukaryotic cells 
      platform. That has demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of viruses, both in 
      vitro and in vivo. Recent antiviral methods involve using small interfering RNA 
      (siRNA) and other, immune-based therapies to target specific gene segments (S, M, 
      or L) of the Hantavirus. This therapeutic approach enhances viral RNA clearance 
      through the RNA interference process in Vero E6 cells or human lung microvascular 
      endothelial cells. However, the use of siRNAs faces challenges due to their low 
      biological stability and limited in vivo targeting ability. Despite their 
      successful inhibition of Hantavirus replication in host cells, their antiviral 
      efficacy may be hindered. In the current review, we focus on advances in 
      therapeutic strategies, as antiviral medications, immune-based therapies and 
      vaccine candidates aimed at enhancing the body's ability to control the 
      progression of Hantavirus infections, with the potential to reduce the risk of 
      severe disease.

      phytohormonal balance and antioxidant metabolism in rice.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) contamination is an eminent dilemma that jeopardizes global food 
      safety and security, especially through its phytotoxicity in rice; one of the 
      most edible crops. Melatonin (MET) has emerged as a protective phytohormone in 
      stress conditions, but the defensive role and underlying mechanisms of MET 
      against Cd toxicity in rice still remain unclear. To fulfill this knowledge gap, 
      the present study is to uncover the key mechanisms for MET-mediated Cd-stress 
      tolerance in rice. Cd toxicity significantly reduced growth by hindering the 
      process of photosynthesis, cellular redox homeostasis, phytohormonal imbalance, 
      and ultrastructural damages. Contrarily, MET supplementation considerably 
      improved growth attributes, photosynthetic efficiency, and cellular 
      ultrastructure as measured by gas exchange elements, chlorophyll content, reduced 
      Cd accumulation, and ultrastructural analysis via transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM). MET treatment significantly reduced Cd accumulation 
      (39.25%/31.58%), MDA (25.87%/19.45%), H(2)O(2) (17.93%/9.56%), and O(2) 
      (29.11%/27.14%) levels in shoot/root tissues, respectively, when compared with Cd 
      treatment. More importantly, MET manifested association with stress responsive 
      phytohormones (ABA and IAA) and boosted the defense mechanisms of plant by 
      enhancing the activities of ROS-scavenging antioxidant enzymes (SOD; superoxide 
      dismutase, POD; peroxidase, CAT; catalase, APX; ascorbate peroxidase) and as well 
      as regulating the key stress-responsive genes (OsSOD1, OsPOD1, OsCAT2, OsAPX1), 
      thereby reinstate cellular membrane integrity and confer tolerance to 
      ultrastructural damages under Cd-induced phytotoxicity. Overall, our findings 
      emphasized the potential of MET as a long-term and cost-effective approach to Cd 
      remediation in paddy soils, which can pave the way for a healthier and more 
      environmentally conscious agricultural sector.

AB  - The utilization of individualized anti-platelet therapy is of paramount 
      significance in this era of cardiovascular advancement. This meta-analysis is 
      also aiming to get more information relating to the effectiveness of ticagrelor 
      versus clopidogrel among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention 
      (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A comprehensive literature search was 
      done through various databases like PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, Web of 
      Science, and the Cochrane Database Library from January 15, 2023, to February 23, 
      2023. After careful screening, eight articles with highly significant variables 
      were involved in the synthesis of this meta-analysis. Data analysis was done 
      through Review Manager (RevMan, Version 5.4; The Cochrane Collaboration, 
      Copenhagen, Denmark). In our study, ticagrelor and clopidogrel were evaluated in 
      10614 and 14662 patients, respectively. Ticagrelor was significantly superior to 
      Clopidogrel in terms of all-cause mortality (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69-0.91, p = 
      0.001), risk of MI (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.61-0.89, p = 0.001), and stroke (RR 0.64, 
      95% CI 0.42-0.98, p = 0.04), but a higher risk of bleeding events was observed 
      with Ticagrelor (RR 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.79, p = 0.03). The two regimens were 
      comparable in terms of stent thrombosis. Ticagrelor was found to be best in terms 
      of reducing post-PCI myocardial infarction, stroke, stent thrombosis, and all 
      other mortality events in comparison to Clopidogrel. However, the bleeding events 
      were of significant concern for the utilization of ticagrelor and required 
      further investigations.

AB  - Apoptosis is regulated by the BCL-2 family, which includes the anti-apoptotic and 
      pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bok, Bak, etc.). These proteins often interact in 
      dimers and act as apoptotic switches. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as BCL-2, 
      block the functions of these pro-apoptotic proteins. The pro-apoptotic and 
      anti-apoptotic protein-protein interactions must be inhibited to prevent tumor 
      cells from escaping apoptosis. This method has been used to develop anticancer 
      drugs by inhibiting BCL-2 with both natural and synthetic compounds. 
      Metal-containing compounds were used as pharmaceuticals for human cancer patients 
      for a long time, and cisplatin was the first candidate of this class. Drug 
      design, however, needs to pay more attention to metal complexes. We have studied 
      the X-ray crystal structure of the BCL-2 protein in detail and identified the 
      hydrophobic nature of the site with two less solvent-accessible sites. Based on 
      the hydrophobic nature of the compounds, 74 organometallic compounds with X-ray 
      crystallographically characterized bioactivity (including anticancer activity) 
      were selected from the Cambridge crystallographic database. For testing, 
      molecular docking was used to determine which compound was most effective against 
      the BCL-2 protein. Organometallic compounds 
      (benzene)-chloro-(1-[(9H-fluoren-2-yl)imino]methylnaphthalen-2-olato)-ruthenium 
      (2), 
      (1-((1,1'-biphenyl)-4-yl)-2,3,4,5-tetramethylcyclopentadienyl)-chloro-(4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine)-rhodium 
      hexafluorophosphate (37), 
      (mu-1,1'-(butane-1,4-diyl)bis(3-oxy-2-methylpyridin-4(1H)-one))-dichloro-bis(pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl)-di-rhodium 
      tetrahydrate (46), 
      (mu-1,1'-(butane-1,4-diyl)bis(3-oxy-2-methylpyridin-4(1H)-one))-dichloro-bis(pentamethyl-cyclopentadienyl)-di-iridium 
      (47) etc are found to be important compounds in this study. The capability of 
      different types of complex interactions was identified using Hirshfeld surface 
      analysis of the complexes. A NCI plot was conducted to understand the nature of 
      the interaction between complex amino acids and active-site amino acids. A DFT 
      study was conducted to examine the stability and chemical reactivity of the 
      selected complexes. Using this study, one suitable hydrophobic lead anti-cancer 
      organometallic pharmaceutical was found that binds at the less solvent-accessible 
      hydrophobic site of BCL-2.

AB  - Due to industrialization and urbanization, the use of detergents inadvertently 
      led to contamination of aquatic environments, thus posing potential threat to 
      aquatic organisms and human health. One of the main components of detergents is 
      linear alkylbenzene sulfonate (LAS), which can cause toxic effects on living 
      organisms, particularly aquatic life in the environment. In this study, floating 
      treatment wetlands (FTWs) mesocosms were developed and augmented with 
      LAS-degrading bacteria. The plant species, Brachiaria mutica (Para grass), was 
      vegetated to establish FTWs and bacterial consortium (1:1:1:1) of Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa strain PJRS20, Bacillus sp. BRRH60, Acinetobacter sp. strain CYRH21, 
      and Burkholderia phytofirmans Ps.JN was augmented (free or immobilized) in these 
      mesocosms. Results revealed that the FTWs removed LAS from the contaminated water 
      and their augmentation with bacteria slightly increased LAS removal during course 
      of the experiment. Maximum reduction in LAS concentration (94%), chemical oxygen 
      demand (91%), biochemical oxygen demand (93%), and total organic carbon (91%) was 
      observed in the contaminated water having FTWs augmented with bacterial 
      consortium immobilized on polystyrene sheet. This study highlights that the FTWs 
      supported with immobilized bacteria on polystyrene sheets can provide an 
      eco-friendly and sustainable solution for the remediation of LAS-bearing water, 
      especially for developing countries like Pakistan.

TI  - Exploring the role of lncrna neat1 knockdown in regulating apoptosis across 
      multiple cancer types: A review.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal regulators of gene 
      expression, contributing significantly to a diverse range of cellular processes, 
      including apoptosis. One such lncRNA is NEAT1, which is elevated in several types 
      of cancer and aid in cancer growth. However, recent studies have also 
      demonstrated that the knockdown of NEAT1 can inhibit cancer cells proliferation, 
      movement, and infiltration while enhancing apoptosis. This article explores the 
      function of lncRNA NEAT1 knockdown in regulating apoptosis across multiple cancer 
      types. We explore the existing understanding of NEAT1's involvement in the 
      progression of malignant conditions, including its structure and functions. 
      Additionally, we investigate the molecular mechanisms by which NEAT1 modulates 
      the cell cycle, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, movement, and infiltration in 
      diverse cancer types, including acute myeloid leukemia, breast cancer, cervical 
      cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, glioma, non-small 
      cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and retinoblastoma. 
      Furthermore, we review the recent studies investigating the therapeutic potential 
      of NEAT1 knockdown in cancer treatment. Targeting the lncRNA NEAT1 presents a 
      promising therapeutic approach for treating cancer. It has shown the ability to 
      suppress cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while promoting 
      apoptosis in various cancer types.

AB  - KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Jacobs syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia are 
      separate entities but share common clinical features such as ambiguous genitalia. 
      Further studies are needed to conclude the relationship between Jacobs syndrome 
      and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. ABSTRACT: A 5-month-old male infant was 
      evaluated for ambiguous genitalia. Examination revealed cryptorchidism, inguinal 
      hernia, long phallus, and Grade 3 scrotal hypospadias. Serum 17-OH progesterone 
      was high and chromosomal analysis showed 47XYY/45XO. A diagnosis of Jacobs and 
      CAH was made. The parents were counseled about the patient's condition. He was 
      given hydrocortisone and referred to the pediatric surgeon for further 
      management.

AB  - Gossypiboma is a rarely reported surgical complication and refers to a retained 
      surgical textile in the body after a procedure. The surrounding inflammation and 
      reaction often manifest as acute pain and subsequently require additional 
      surgery. We report the case of a 33-year-old female who presented with acute 
      abdominal pain one month after undergoing an exploratory laparotomy secondary to 
      a gunshot wound in her home country. A diagnosis of retained foreign body was 
      made with radiological imaging and confirmed upon the retrieval of two surgical 
      sponges after the operation. Due to the high morbidity and mortality as well as 
      increased healthcare costs, strict protocols must be followed to avoid such 
      outcomes.

AB  - The coloring behavior of laccaic acid, a natural red dye derived from lac 
      insects, has been investigated in this work for the dyeing of silk and viscose 
      fabrics while being heated in MW radiation. The extract was made in an aqueous 
      and acidic media and then used to color fabrics under microwave treatment for up 
      to 10 min. For developing new shades, eco-friendly green bio-mordants and, in 
      comparison, chemical mordants were employed at given conditions. The obtained 
      results revealed that the aqueous extract after 4 min of radiation exposure 
      produced a high color strength (K/S  =  17.132) onto silk and the aqueous extract 
      after 6 min of radiation exposure produced better color strength (K/S  =  6.542) 
      onto viscose at selected conditions. The fastness ratings evaluation as per ISO 
      standards demonstrates that bio-anchors have provided good ratings under selected 
      irradiation and dyeing conditions. It is concluded that this environmentally 
      friendly technique has improved the natural coloration process of fabrics as well 
      as addition of green mordants has furnished colorfast shades using lac-derived 
      natural anthraquinone dye.

TI  - Molecular characterization of lumpy skin disease virus from recent outbreaks in 
      Pakistan.
PG  - 297
LID - 10.1007/s00705-023-05925-0 [doi]
AB  - Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a contagious viral transboundary disease listed as a 
      notifiable disease by the World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH). The first 
      case of this disease was reported in Pakistan in late 2021. Since then, numerous 
      outbreaks have been documented in various regions and provinces across the 
      country. The current study primarily aimed to analyze samples collected during 
      LSD outbreaks in cattle populations in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of 
      Pakistan. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using partial sequences of the 
      GPCR, p32, and RP030 genes. Collectively, the LSDV strains originating from 
      outbreaks in Pakistan exhibited a noticeable clustering pattern with LSDV strains 
      reported in African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, including Egypt, the 
      Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, India, China, and Thailand. The precise reasons behind 
      the origin of the virus strain and its subsequent spread to Pakistan remain 
      unknown. This underscores the need for further investigations into outbreaks 
      across the country. The findings of the current study can contribute to the 
      establishment of effective disease control strategies, including the 
      implementation of a mass vaccination campaign in disease-endemic countries such 
      as Pakistan.

TI  - Structural modulation of insulin by hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.
PG  - 34097-34106
LID - 10.1039/d3ra06647a [doi]
AB  - In the bloodstream, insulin interacts with various kinds of molecules, which can 
      alter its structure and modulate its function. In this work, we have synthesized 
      two molecules having extremely hydrophilic and hydrophobic side chains. The 
      effects of hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules on the binding with insulin have 
      been investigated through a multi-spectroscopic approach. We found that 
      hydrophilic molecules have a slightly higher binding affinity towards insulin. 
      Insulin can bind with the hydrophilic molecules as it binds glucose. The high 
      insulin binding affinity of a hydrophobic molecule indicates its dual nature. The 
      hydrophobic molecule binds at the hydrophobic pocket of the insulin surface, 
      where hydrophilic molecules interact at the polar surface of the insulin. Such 
      binding with the hydrophobic molecule perturbs strongly the secondary structure 
      of the insulin much more in comparison to hydrophilic molecules. Therefore, the 
      stability of insulin decreases in the presence of hydrophobic molecules.

TI  - Exploration of violet-to-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters 
      based on "CH/N" and "H/CN" substitutions at diphenylsulphone acceptor. A DFT 
      study.

LID - 1279355
AB  - The violet-to-blue thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters were 
      created employing several substituents based on 5,5-dimethyl-5,10-dihydropyrido 
      [2,3-b][1,8] naphthyridine-diphenylsulphone (DMDHPN-DPS) called 1a via "CH/N" and 
      "H/CN" substitutions at the diphenylsulphone acceptor (DPS) moiety. The parent 
      compound 1a was selected from our former work after extensive research employing 
      "CH/N" substitution on Dimethyl-acridine (DMAC) donor moiety. There is a little 
      overlap amid the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and lowest 
      un-occupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) due to the distribution of HOMOs and LUMOs 
      primarily on the DMDHPN donor and the DPS acceptor moieties, respectively. It 
      resulted in a narrower energy gap (∆E (ST)) between the lowest singlet (S(1)) and 
      triplet (T(1)) excited state. In nearly all derivatives, the steric hindrance 
      results in a larger torsional angle (85 degrees -98 degrees ) between the plane of the DMDHPN and 
      the DPS moieties. The predicted DeltaE (ST) values of the compounds with "H/CN" 
      substitution were lower than those of the comparable "CH/N" substituents, 
      demonstrating the superiority of the reversible inter-system crossing (RISC) from 
      the T(1) --> S(1) state. All derivatives have emission wavelengths (lambda (em)) in the 
      range of 357-449 nm. The LUMO --> HOMO transition energies in the S(1) states are 
      lowered by the presence of -CN groups or -N = atoms at the ortho or meta sites of 
      a DPS acceptor unit, causing the lambda (em) values to red-shift. Furthermore, the lambda 
      (em) showed a greater red-shift as there were more-CN groups or -N = atoms. Three 
      of the derivatives named 1b, 1g, and 1h, emit violet (394 nm, 399 nm, and 398 nm, 
      respectively), while two others, 1f and 1i, emit blue shade (449 nm each) with 
      reasonable emission intensity peak demonstrating that these derivatives are 
      effective violet-to-blue TADF nominees. The lower DeltaE (ST) value for derivative 1i 
      (0.01 eV) with lambda (em) values of 449 nm make this molecule the finest choice for 
      blue TADF emitter amongst all the studied derivatives. We believe our research 
      might lead to the development of more proficient blue TADF-OLEDs in the future.

AB  - The genetic diversity of local coffee populations is crucial to breed new 
      varieties better adapted to the increasingly stressful environment due to climate 
      change and evolving consumer preferences. Unfortunately, local coffee germplasm 
      conservation and genetic assessment have not received much attention. Molecular 
      tools offer substantial benefits in identifying and selecting new cultivars or 
      clones suitable for sustainable commercial utilization. New annotation methods, 
      such as chloroplast barcoding, are necessary to produce accurate and high-quality 
      phylogenetic analyses. This study used DNA barcoding techniques to examine the 
      genetic relationships among fifty-six accessions collected from the southwestern 
      part of Saudi Arabia. PCR amplification and sequence characterization were used 
      to investigate the effectiveness of four barcoding loci: atpB-rbcl, trnL-trnF, 
      trnT-trnL, and trnL. The maximum nucleotide sites, nucleotide diversity, and an 
      average number of nucleotide differences were recorded for atpB-rbcl, while 
      trnT-trnL had the highest variable polymorphic sites, segregating sites, and 
      haploid diversity. Among the four barcode loci, trnT-trnL recorded the highest 
      singleton variable sites, while trnL recorded the highest parsimony information 
      sites. Furthermore, the phylogenetic analysis clustered the Coffea arabica 
      genotypes into four different groups, with three genotypes (KSA31, KSA38, and 
      KSA46) found to be the most divergent genotypes standing alone in the cluster and 
      remained apart during the analysis. The study demonstrates the presence of 
      considerable diversity among coffee populations in Saudi Arabia. Furthermore, it 
      also shows that DNA barcoding is an effective technique for identifying local 
      coffee genotypes, with potential applications in coffee conservation and breeding 
      efforts.

AB  - Cancer is a complex disease that causes abnormal genetic changes and unchecked 
      cellular growth. It also causes a disruption in the normal regulatory processes 
      that leads to the creation of malignant tissue. The complex interplay of genetic, 
      environmental, and epigenetic variables influences its etiology. Long non-coding 
      RNAs (LncRNAs) have emerged as pivotal contributors within the intricate 
      landscape of cancer biology, orchestrating an array of multifaceted cellular 
      processes that substantiate the processes of carcinogenesis and metastasis. 
      Metastasis is a crucial driver of cancer mortality. Among these, MALAT1 
      (Metastasis-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1) has drawn a lot of 
      interest for its function in encouraging metastasis via controlling the 
      Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) procedure. MALAT1 exerts a pivotal 
      influence on the process of EMT, thereby promoting metastasis to distant organs. 
      The mechanistic underpinning of this phenomenon involves the orchestration of an 
      intricate regulatory network encompassing transcription factors, signalling 
      cascades, and genes intricately associated with the EMT process by MALAT1. Its 
      crucial function in transforming tumor cells into an aggressive phenotype is 
      highlighted by its capacity to influence the expression of essential EMT 
      effectors such as N-cadherin, E-cadherin, and Snail. An understanding of the 
      MALAT1-EMT axis provides potential therapeutic approaches for cancer 
      intervention. Targeting MALAT1 or its downstream EMT effectors may reduce the 
      spread of metastatic disease and improve the effectiveness of already available 
      therapies. Understanding the MALAT1-EMT axis holds significant clinical 
      implications. Therefore, directing attention towards MALAT1 or its downstream 
      mediators could present innovative therapeutic strategies for mitigating 
      metastasis and improving patient prognosis. This study highlights the importance 
      of MALAT1 in cancer biology and its potential for cutting back on metastatic 
      disease with novel treatment strategies.

AB  - Abiotic stresses are a significant constraint to plant production globally. 
      Identifying stress-related genes can aid in the development of stress-tolerant 
      elite genotypes and facilitate trait and crop manipulation. The primary aim of 
      this study was to conduct whole transcriptome analyses of the salt-tolerant faba 
      bean genotype, Hassawi-2, under different durations of salt stress (6 h, 12 h, 
      24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) at the early vegetative stage, to better understand the 
      molecular basis of salt tolerance. After de novo assembly, a total of 140,308 
      unigenes were obtained. The up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 
      were 2380, 2863, 3057, 3484, and 4820 at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of salt 
      stress, respectively. Meanwhile, 1974, 3436, 2371, 3502, and 5958 genes were 
      downregulated at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of salt stress, respectively. 
      These DEGs encoded various regulatory and functional proteins, including kinases, 
      plant hormone proteins, transcriptional factors (TFs) basic helix-loop-helix 
      (bHLH), Myeloblastosis (MYB), and (WRKY), heat shock proteins (HSPs), late 
      embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, dehydrin, antioxidant enzymes, and 
      aquaporin proteins. This suggests that the faba bean genome possesses an 
      abundance of salinity resistance genes, which trigger different adaptive 
      mechanisms under salt stress. Some selected DEGs validated the RNA sequencing 
      results, thus confirming similar gene expression levels. This study represents 
      the first transcriptome analysis of faba bean leaves subjected to salinity stress 
      offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing salt tolerance in faba 
      bean during the vegetative stage. This comprehensive investigation enhances our 
      understanding of precise gene regulatory mechanisms and holds promise for the 
      development of novel salt-tolerant faba bean salt-tolerant cultivars.

AB  - In this study, indolyl-4H-chromene derivatives are designed and synthesised using 
      an eco-friendly multicomponent one-pot synthesis using benzaldehydes, nitroketene 
      N, S-acetals, and indoles combine with InCl(3) , a Lewis acid catalyst, and 
      ethanol, an environmentally acceptable solvent. Due to antibiotic resistance, 
      assessed these Indolyl-4H-chromene derivatives for their in vitro antibacterial 
      activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including 
      Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium pyrogenes, Bacillus 
      subtilis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using the agar well 
      diffusion method and Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) assay. Three 
      compounds, 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-6-methoxy-N-methyl-3-nitro-4H-chromen-2-amine, 
      4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-nitro-N-phenyl-4H-chromen-2-amine and 
      4-(6-Fluoro-1H-Indol-3-yl)-N-methyl-3-nitro-4H-chromen-2-amine showed better zone 
      of inhibition (mm) and Minimum Inhibition Concentration (MIC) values of 10 mug/mL 
      to 25 mug/mL against all bacterial types. The Ki values of 278.60 nM and 2.21 nM 
      for compound 4-(1H-indol-3-yl)-3-nitro-N-phenyl-4H-chromen-2-amine showed 
      improved interactions with DNA gyrase B and topoIV ParE's ATP binding sites in in 
      silico studies.

AB  - The plant-parasitic Root Knot Nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.,) play a pivotal role 
      to devastate vegetable crops across the globe. Considering the significance of 
      plant-microbe interaction in the suppression of Root Knot Nematode, we 
      investigated the diversity of microbiome associated with bioagents-treated and 
      nematode-infected rhizosphere soil samples through metagenomics approach. The 
      wide variety of organisms spread across different ecosystems showed the highest 
      average abundance within each taxonomic level. In the rhizosphere, 
      Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria were the dominant bacterial taxa, 
      while Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Mucoromycota were prevalent among the fungal 
      taxa. Regardless of the specific treatments, bacterial genera like Bacillus, 
      Sphingomonas, and Pseudomonas were consistently found in high abundance. Shannon 
      diversity index vividly ensured that, bacterial communities were maximum in B. 
      velezensis VB7-treated soil (1.4-2.4), followed by Root Knot Nematode-associated 
      soils (1.3-2.2), whereas richness was higher with Trichoderma konigiopsis TK 
      drenched soils (1.3-2.0). The predominant occurrence of fungal genera such as 
      Aspergillus Epicoccum, Choanephora, Alternaria and Thanatephorus habituate 
      rhizosphere soils. Shannon index expressed the abundant richness of fungal 
      species in treated samples (1.04-0.90). Further, refraction and species diversity 
      curve also depicted a significant increase with maximum diversity of fungal 
      species in B. velezensis VB7-treated soil than T. koningiopsis and 
      nematode-infested soil. In field trial, bioagents-treated tomato plant (60% 
      reduction of Meloidogyne incognita infection) had reduced gall index along with 
      enhanced plant growth and increased fruit yield in comparison with the untreated 
      plant. Hence, B. velezensis VB7 and T. koingiopsis can be well explored as an 
      antinemic bioagents against RKN. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version

AB  - This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of the pharmacological 
      properties of erucic acid (EA) and highlight areas that require further research. 
      EA is an omega-9 fatty acid found in certain vegetable oil, such as rapeseed oil 
      has demonstrated favourable effects in rodents, including ameliorating myocardial 
      lipidosis (fat accumulation in the heart muscle), congestive heart disease, 
      hepatic steatosis (fat accumulation in the liver), and memory impairments. These 
      findings have prompted regulatory bodies to establish limits on EA content in 
      food oils. The studies were performed on rodents and led to caution on ingesting 
      the EA at high levels. Moreover, EA is frequently utilized as a nutritional 
      supplement for the treatment of adrenoleukodystrophy, myocardial disease, and 
      memory improvement. The review of the article indicated that EA improves 
      cognitive function, has a part in Huntington's disease, interacts with peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptors, inhibits elastase and thrombin, has 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-tumour properties, and inhibits 
      influenza A virus. This article elucidates the pharmacological effects of EA, an 
      omega-9 fatty acid.

AB  - Lung cancer remains a formidable global health burden, necessitating a 
      comprehensive understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms driving its 
      progression. Recently, lncRNAs have become necessary controllers of various 
      biological functions, including cancer development. MALAT1 has garnered 
      significant attention due to its multifaceted role in lung cancer progression. 
      Lung cancer, among other malignancies, upregulates MALAT1. Its overexpression has 
      been associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient prognosis. MALAT1 
      promotes cellular proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and 
      angiogenesis in lung cancer, collectively facilitating tumor growth and 
      metastasis. Additionally, MALAT1 enhances cancer cell invasion by interacting 
      with numerous signaling pathways. Furthermore, MALAT1 has been implicated in 
      mediating drug resistance in lung cancer, contributing to the limited efficacy of 
      conventional therapies. Recent advancements in molecular biology and 
      high-throughput sequencing technologies have offered fresh perspectives into the 
      regulatory networks of MALAT1 in lung cancer. It exerts its oncogenic effects by 
      acting as a ceRNA to sponge microRNAs, thereby relieving their inhibitory effects 
      on target genes. Moreover, MALAT1 also influences chromatin remodeling and 
      post-translational modifications to modulate gene expression, further expanding 
      its regulatory capabilities. This review sheds light on the multifaceted roles of 
      MALAT1 in lung cancer progression, underscoring its potential as an innovative 
      therapeutic target and diagnostic biomarker. Targeting MALAT1 alone or combined 
      with existing therapies holds promise to mitigate lung cancer progression and 
      improve patient outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of vascular endothelial growth factor A 
      gene polymorphisms 2578C/A (rs699947) and 1154G/A (rs1570360) with type 2 
      diabetes mellitus, diabetic retinopathy and serum vascular endothelial growth 
      factor levels in Pakistani patients. METHODS: The case-control study was 
      conducted from Jan 2017 to Dec 2018 after approval from the ethics review board 
      of Riphah International University, Islamabad, Pakistan, and comprised type 2 
      diabetes mellitus patients of either gender with diabetic retinopathy in group A, 
      and without diabetic retinopathy in group B. Non-diabetic healthy individuals 
      were enrolled in control group C. Genotyping was done by amplification refractory 
      mutation system-polymerase chain reaction and serum vascular endothelial growth 
      factor levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data was 
      analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 450 subjects, 150(33.3%) were in each of 
      the 3 groups. The mean age in group A was 58.16+/-9.42, in group B 56.25+/-8.5 years 
      and in group C it was 55.90+/-10.90. The proportion of Punjabi ethnicity was 
      significantly high in group B compared to other groups (p<0.05). There was no 
      significant association of rs699947 and rs1570360 genotypic and allelic 
      frequencies in group B compared to group A. Further, rs699947 AA genotype was 
      significantly associated with proliferative diabetic retinopathy compared to 
      group A (p<0.05). Minor allele A showed significant association in groups A and B 
      compared to group C (p<0.05). Significantly raised serum vascular endothelial 
      growth factor levels were found in group B compared to group A (p<0.05), and were 
      associated with rs699947 and rs1570360 heterozygosity in group A (p<0.05). Also, 
      rs699947 genotype showed significant association with groups A and B in Punjabi 
      and Pathan ethnicities (p<0.05) and with Kashmiri ethnicity in group B (p<0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: There was a strong association of vascular endothelial growth factor 
      2578C/A (rs699947) gene polymorphism with proliferative diabetic retinopathy in 
      type 2 diabetic Pakistani patients, suggesting its role in the pathogenesis of 
      this condition.

AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to have a crucial function 
      in the modulation of the activity of genes, impacting a variety of homeostatic 
      processes involving growth, survival, movement, and genomic consistency. Certain 
      lncRNAs' aberrant expression has been linked to carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and 
      therapeutic resistance. They are beneficial for the management of malignancies 
      since they can function as cancer-causing or cancer-suppressing genes and behave 
      as screening or prognosis indicators. The modulation of the tumor 
      microenvironment, metabolic modification, and spread have all been linked to 
      lncRNAs in lung cancer. Recent research has indicated that lncRNAs may interact 
      with various mTOR signalling systems to control expression in lung cancer. 
      Furthermore, the route can affect how lncRNAs are expressed. Emphasizing the 
      function of lncRNAs as crucial participants in the mTOR pathway, the current 
      review intends to examine the interactions between the mTOR cascade and the 
      advancement of lung cancer. The article will shed light on the roles and 
      processes of a few lncRNAs associated with the development of lung cancer, as 
      well as their therapeutic prospects.

      Investigating the mechanism of action through computational methods.

AB  - Neurological disorders (NDs) have become a major cause of both cognitive and 
      physical disabilities worldwide. In NDs, misfolded proteins tend to adopt a 
      beta-sheet-rich fibrillar structure called amyloid. Amyloid beta (Abeta) plays a 
      crucial role in the nervous system. The misfolding and aggregation of Abeta are 
      primary factors in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibiting the 
      oligomerization and aggregation of Abeta is considered as an effective strategy 
      against NDs. While it is known that berberine analogs exhibit anti-Abeta aggregation 
      properties, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear. In this study, we 
      have employed computational approaches to unravel the possible mechanism by which 
      berberine combats Abeta aggregation. The introduction of berberine was observed to 
      delay the equilibrium of Abeta(16)(-)(21) oligomerization. Initially, within the 
      first 10 ns of simulation, beta-sheets content was 12.89 % and gradually increased 
      to 22.19 % within the first 20 ns. This upward trend continued, reaching 32.80 %. 
      However, berberine substantially reduced the formation of beta-sheets to 1.36 %. 
      These findings decipher the potency of berberine against Abeta(16)(-)(21) 
      oligomerization, a crucial step for beta-sheet formation. Additionally, a remarkable 
      decrease in total number of hydrogen bonds was found in the presence of 
      berberine. Berberine also led to a slight reduction in the flexibility of 
      Abeta(16)(-)(21), which may be due to the formation of a more stable structures. 
      This study offers valuable insights at the mechanistic level, which could prove 
      beneficial in the development of new drugs to combat NDs.

AB  - Aflatoxin is a naturally occurring mycotoxin that has numerous toxic effects. The 
      main aim of the present study was to evaluate the toxic effects of aflatoxin B1 
      (AFB1) on the lungs and spleen. Mice were repeatedly exposed to AFB1 (0.3 mg/kg 
      body weight) on alternate days for four weeks via oral route. The 
      histopathological data in AFB1-treated mice show alveolar epithelial hyperplasia 
      with inflammation and the presence of numerous alveolar macrophages with minimal 
      hemorrhage. There was an increase in vascular neutrophils and interstitial 
      inflammation. The branching of vessels was plugged with neutrophils. AFB1 
      administration also causes splenomegaly. The AFB1-treated spleen shows the 
      tingible body macrophages (TBM) scattered within the splenic white pulp. 
      Apoptosis may lead to atrophy in a selected region of the white pulp area. There 
      is a decrease in cellularity within the periarteriolar lymphatic sheath (PALS). 
      The inflammation causes the congestion of red pulp with the increase in nuclear 
      debris, and vacuoles are also visible. The flow cytometry data further suggests 
      enhanced apoptosis in lung and spleen cells.

AB  - Phytonanotechnology plays a crucial part in the production of good quality and 
      high-yield food. It can also alter the plant's production systems, hence 
      permitting the efficient, controlled and stable release of agrochemicals such as 
      fertilizers and pesticides. An advanced understanding of nanomaterials 
      interaction with plant responses like localization and uptake, etc. could 
      transfigure the production of crops with high disease resistance and efficient 
      nutrients utilization. In agriculture, the use of nanomaterials has gained 
      acceptance due to their wide-range applications. However, their toxicity and 
      bioavailability are the major hurdles for their massive employment. Undoubtedly, 
      nanoparticles positively influence seeds germination, growth and development, 
      stress management and post-harvest handling of vegetables and fruits. These 
      nanoparticles may also cause toxicity in plants through oxidative stress by 
      generation of excessive reactive oxygen species thus affecting the cellular 
      biomolecules and targeting different channels. Nanoparticles have shown to exert 
      various effects on plants that are mainly affected by various attributes such as 
      physicochemical features of nanomaterials, coating materials for nanoparticles, 
      type of plant, growth stages and growth medium for plants. This article discusses 
      the interaction, accretion and toxicity of nanomaterials in plants. The factors 
      inducing nanotoxicity and the mechanisms followed by nanomaterials causing 
      toxicity are also instructed. At the end, detoxification mechanism of plant is 
      also presented.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have demonstrated the potential to enhance the 
      saline-alkali tolerance in plants. Nevertheless, the extent to which AMF can 
      ameliorate the tolerance of salt-sensitive plants to alkaline conditions 
      necessitates further investigation. The current study is primarily centered on 
      elucidating the impact of AMF on the growth of the Huayu22 (H22) when cultivated 
      in saline-alkaline soil. We leveraged DNA of rhizosphere microorganisms extracted 
      from saline-alkali soil subjected to AMF treatment and conducted high-throughput 
      sequencing encompassing 16S rRNA gene and ITS sequencing. Our findings from 
      high-throughput sequencing unveiled Proteobacteria and Bacillus as the prevailing 
      phylum and genus within the bacterial population, respectively. Likewise, the 
      predominant fungal phylum and genus were identified as Ascomycota and 
      Haematonectria. It is noteworthy that the relative abundance of Proteobacteria, 
      Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, and Ascomycota exhibited significant 
      increments subsequent to AMF inoculation. Our investigation into soil enzyme 
      activity revealed a remarkable surge post-AMF inoculation. Notably, the amounts 
      of pathogen growth inhibitory enzymes and organic carbon degrading enzymes rise, 
      as predicted by the putative roles of microbial communities. In saline-alkali 
      soil, inoculation of AMF did boost the yield of H22. Notable improvements were 
      observed in the weight of both 100 fruits and 100 grains, which increased by 
      20.02% and 22.30%, respectively. Conclusively, this study not only provides a 
      theoretical framework but also furnishes empirical evidence supporting the 
      utilization of AMF as a viable strategy for augmenting the yield of 
      salt-sensitive plants grown in alkaline conditions.

AB  - The global prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has 
      increased over the last decade and has emerged as the third leading cause of 
      death worldwide. It is characterized by emphysema with prolonged airflow 
      limitation. COPD patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and increase the 
      disease severity about four times. The most used drugs to treat it show numerous 
      side effects, including immune suppression and infection. This review discusses a 
      narrative opinion and critical review of COPD. We present different aspects of 
      the disease, from cellular and inflammatory responses to cigarette smoking in 
      COPD and signaling pathways. In addition, we highlighted various risk factors for 
      developing COPD apart from smoking, like occupational exposure, pollutants, 
      genetic factors, gender, etc. After the recent elucidation of the underlying 
      inflammatory signaling pathways in COPD, new molecular targeted drug candidates 
      for COPD are signal-transmitting substances. We further summarize recent 
      developments in biomarker discovery for COPD and its implications for disease 
      diagnosis. In addition, we discuss novel drug targets for COPD that could be 
      explored for drug development and subsequent clinical management of 
      cardiovascular disease and COVID-19, commonly associated with COPD. Our extensive 
      analysis of COPD cause, etiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic will provide a 
      better understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic 
      options. In-depth knowledge of the underlying mechanism will offer deeper 
      insights into identifying novel molecular targets for developing potent 
      therapeutics and biomarkers of disease diagnosis.

AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a persistent inflammatory condition affecting the 
      colon's mucosal lining, leading to chronic bowel inflammation. Despite extensive 
      research, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying UC pathogenesis remain 
      elusive. NcRNAs form a category of functional RNA molecules devoid of 
      protein-coding capacity. They have recently surfaced as pivotal modulators of 
      gene expression and integral participants in various pathological processes, 
      particularly those related to inflammatory disorders. The diverse classes of 
      ncRNAs, encompassing miRNAs, circRNAs, and lncRNAs, have been implicated in UC. 
      It highlights their involvement in key UC-related processes, such as immune cell 
      activation, epithelial barrier integrity, and the production of pro-inflammatory 
      mediators. ncRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for UC diagnosis 
      and monitoring disease progression, offering promising avenues for personalized 
      medicine. This approach may pave the way for novel, more specific treatments with 
      reduced side effects, addressing the current limitations of conventional 
      therapies. A comprehensive understanding of the interplay between ncRNAs and UC 
      will advance our knowledge of the disease, potentially leading to more effective 
      and personalized treatments for patients suffering from this debilitating 
      condition. This review explores the pivotal role of ncRNAs in the context of UC, 
      shedding light on their possible targets for diagnosis, prognosis, and 
      therapeutic interventions.

      leonine facies. Blood work showed no diagnostic aberrancies. Skin biopsy 
      contained a malignant CD4+/CD56+ mononuclear cell population concerning for 
      blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm. A later bone marrow biopsy 
      confirmed AML with KMT2A::MLLT10 fusion detected by next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS). This patient's LC preceded blood and marrow based symptoms of AML. NGS of 
      the initial skin biopsy should be considered as part of diagnostic guidelines in 
      cases with LC in the differential as this may have led to earlier diagnosis in 
      this case and future cases.

AB  - Immune cell infiltration is associated with improved prognosis in the 
      microenvironment of breast cancer. The incidence of breast cancer in Pakistan is 
      2.5 times higher than that in neighboring countries of Asia, accounting for 34.6% 
      of female cancers. The objectives of this study were to compare and determine 
      apoptotic mediators and biomarkers for breast carcinoma, such as serum granzyme 
      B, cytochrome C, and vitamin D by ELIZA and calcium spectrophotometrically. Study 
      groups were differentiated into malignant breast disease G-I, benign 
      proliferative breast disease G-II, and healthy control group G-III. The 
      immune-related prognostic markers and therapeutic targets were determined through 
      the interaction of proteins by molecular docking and AutoDock Vina software. The 
      level of granzyme B and cyt C was higher in Group-I, -II, and -III. Likewise, the 
      mean vitamin D level was greater in Group-I than those in other groups. Through 
      SwissDock, the proteins granzyme B and cyt C with vitamin D, single amino acid 
      residue MET34 (H-bond 2.75 A), and ILE81(H-bond 2.092 A) were revealed to 
      actively participate in interactions. This study reveals granzyme B and cyt C as 
      biomarkers for malignant breast disease and benign proliferative breast disease, 
      while hypovitaminosis D and hypocalcemia are complications or comorbidities of 
      breast cancer.

AB  - Carfilzomib (CFZ), a chemotherapeutic agent used for multiple myeloma treatments 
      reported to cause high incidence of cardiac events either new onset and/or 
      exacerbate formerly diagnosed heart failure with ventricular and myocardial 
      dysfunction. Purpose: Current research designed to explore and examine the 
      preventive effect of oxyphenbutazone in the CFZ -instigated cardiotoxicity. 
      Methodology: Female Wistar Rats weighing 200-250 g selected randomly and grouped 
      as follows: Group 1 designated as the Normal control and receive normal saline 
      only. Group 2 served toxic control and exposed to CFZ (4 mg/kg, intraperitoneally 
      [i.p.]). Group 3 & 4 served as treatment groups and administered with CFZ 
      concomitantly orally fed with oxyphenbutazone at doses of 35 and 70 mg/kg/three 
      times a week, respectively. The total duration of experimental protocol was of 
      21 days. After completion of the experiments animals subjected to blood 
      collection using light ether anesthesia and serum was separated for biochemical 
      analysis further. The serum levels of Mg(+2), Ca(+2) and cardiac enzymes 
      (aspartate transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) 
      and creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) levels were estimated. Later animals sacrificed 
      and heart tissue isolated for further examinations. Intracellular proteins NFkB 
      and IkBalpha were estimated by western blot. Results: The serum analysis revealed 
      that CFZ administration significantly elevated the levels of LDH, CK and CKMB in 
      CFZ exposed animals when compared to normal animals while administration of 
      oxyphenbutazone significantly reduced these biochemical changes, Intracellular 
      antioxidant enzymes and NF-kB in treatment groups as compared to disease control 
      animals. Conclusion: Findings of the research protocol suggests significant 
      injuries to cardiac tissues when animals exposed to CFZ and Oxyphenbutazone 
      protected the cardiac tissues.

LID - 10.2147/IJN.S446017 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been found to exhibit unique 
      properties which show their potential to be used in various therapies. Green 
      synthesis of AgNPs has been progressively gaining acceptance due to its 
      cost-effectiveness and energy-efficient nature. OBJECTIVE: In the current study, 
      aqueous extract of Thymus vulgaris (T. vulgaris) was used to synthesize the AgNPs 
      using green synthesis techniques followed by checking the effectiveness and 
      various biological activities of these AgNPs. METHODS: At first, the plant 
      samples were proceeded for extraction of aqueous extracts followed by 
      chromatography studies to measure the phenolics and flavonoids. The synthesis and 
      characterization of AgNPs were done using green synthesis techniques and were 
      confirmed using Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, UV-visible 
      spectroscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), zeta potential, zeta sizer and 
      X-Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. After confirmation of synthesized AgNPs, 
      various biological activities were checked. RESULTS: The chromatography analysis 
      detected nine compounds accounting for 100% of the total amount of plant 
      constituents. The FT-IR, UV-vis spectra, SEM, zeta potential, zeta sizer and XRD 
      analysis confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs and the variety of chemical components 
      present on the surface of synthesized AgNPs in the plant extract. The antioxidant 
      activity of AgNPs showed 92% inhibition at the concentration of at 1000 microg/mL. A 
      greater inhibitory effect in anti-diabetic analysis was observed with synthesized 
      AgNPs as compared to the standard AgNPs. The hemolytic activity was low, but 
      despite low concentrations of hemolysis activity, AgNPs proved not to be toxic or 
      biocompatible. The anti-inflammatory activity of AgNPs was observed by in-vitro 
      and in-vivo approaches in range at various concentrations, while maximum 
      inhibition occurs at 1000 microg (77.31%). CONCLUSION: Our data showed that the 
      potential biological activities of the bioactive constituents of T. vulgaris can 
      be enhanced through green synthesis of AgNPs from T. vulgaris aqueous extracts. 
      In addition, the current study depicted that AgNPs have good potential to cure 
      different ailments as biogenic nano-medicine.

AB  - Glioblastoma is a prevalent form of carcinoma that exhibits a greater incidence 
      rate across diverse demographics globally. Despite extensive global efforts, GBM 
      continues to be a highly lethal disease that is characterized by a grim 
      prognosis. There is a wealth of evidence suggesting that the pathophysiology of 
      GBM is associated with the dysregulation of numerous cellular and molecular 
      processes. The etiology of GBM may involve various cellular and molecular 
      pathways, including EGFR, PDCD4, NF-kappaB, MAPK, matrix metalloproteinases, STAT, 
      and Akt. MicroRNAs, short non-coding RNA molecules, regulate gene expression and 
      mRNA translation after transcription but before translation to exert control over 
      a wide range of biological functions. Extensive research has consistently 
      demonstrated the upregulation of miRNA-21 in glioma, indicating its involvement 
      in diverse biological pathways that facilitate tumor cell survival. By explaining 
      the intricate interplay between miR-21 and the regulation of apoptosis in GBM, 
      this review has the potential to significantly enhance our comprehension of the 
      illness and provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

AB  - In the current research work, Ni(0.2)Co(2.8)O(4) and Ni(0.2)Co(2.8)/MWCNTs have 
      been synthesized via facile sol-gel and wet impregnation method. The synthesized 
      materials attained the crystalline structures as evident from X-ray diffraction 
      analysis (XRD). The uniform morphology and well dispersion of Ni(0.2)Co(2.8)O(4) 
      onto MWCNTs was observed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The 
      electrochemical investigations for supercapacitor application by cyclic 
      voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge discharge (GCD), and electrochemical 
      impedance spectroscopy (EIS) revealed that, among both materials, 
      Ni(0.2)Co(2.8)O(4)/MWCNTs has high specific capacitance (CV; 505.8 Fg(-1) at 
      5 mV/s, GCD; 1598 Fg(-1) at 0.5 A/g), greater capacitance retention (85 %) at 
      1000 cycles and has lower charge transfer resistance (R(ct); 3.48 Omega cm(2)). These 
      findings reflected the potential candidacy of Ni(0.2)Co(2.8)O(4)/MWCNTs to be 
      used as anode material in supercapacitor. Further investigations by CV and linear 
      sweep voltammetry (LSV) for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) activity in 1.0 M KOH 
      showed comparatively low over potential of 340 mV @100 mA/cm(2) for the same 
      integrated material. Additionally, the lower Tafel slope (47 mV/dec) and solution 
      resistance authenticated it as an appropriate electrocatalyst for OER in water 
      splitting. The CPE (controlled potential electrolysis) revealed the stability of 
      both materials for OER in water oxidation.

      Prostate Cancer.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) is an important worldwide medical concern, necessitating a 
      greater understanding of the molecular processes driving its development. The 
      Wnt/-catenin signaling cascade is established as a central player in PCa 
      pathogenesis, and recent research emphasizes the critical involvement of 
      non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in this scenario. This in-depth study seeks to give a 
      thorough examination of the complex relationship between ncRNAs and the 
      Wnt/beta-catenin system in PCa. NcRNAs, such as circular RNAs (circRNAs), long 
      ncRNAs (lncRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs), have been recognized as essential 
      regulators that modulate numerous facets of the Wnt/beta-catenin network. MiRNAs 
      have been recognized as targeting vital elements of the process, either enhancing 
      or inhibiting signaling, depending on their specific roles and targets. LncRNAs 
      participate in fine-tuning the Wnt/beta-catenin network as a result of complicated 
      interplay with both upstream and downstream elements. CircRNAs, despite being a 
      relatively recent addition to the ncRNA family, have been implicated in PCa, 
      influencing the Wnt/beta-catenin cascade through diverse mechanisms. This article 
      encompasses recent advances in our comprehension of specific ncRNAs that 
      participate in the Wnt/beta-catenin network, their functional roles, and clinical 
      relevance in PCa. We investigate their use as screening and predictive 
      indicators, and targets for treatment. Additionally, we delve into the interplay 
      between Wnt/beta-catenin and other signaling networks in PCa and the role of ncRNAs 
      within this complex network. As we unveil the intricate regulatory functions of 
      ncRNAs in the Wnt/beta-catenin cascade in PCa, we gain valuable insights into the 
      disease's pathogenesis. The implementation of these discoveries in practical 
      applications holds promise for more precise diagnosis, prognosis, and targeted 
      therapeutic approaches, ultimately enhancing the care of PCa patients. This 
      comprehensive review underscores the evolving landscape of ncRNA research in PCa 
      and the potential for innovative interventions in the battle against this 
      formidable malignancy.

AB  - Microplastics pose significant challenges to ecosystems and organisms. They can 
      be ingested by marine and terrestrial species, leading to potential health risks 
      and ecological disruptions. This study aims to address the urgent need for 
      effective remediation strategies by focusing on the biodegradation of 
      microplastics, specifically polyvinyl chloride (PVC) derivatives, using the 
      bacterial strain Bacillus albus. The study provides a comprehensive background on 
      the accumulation of noxious substances in the environment and the importance of 
      harnessing biodegradation as an eco-friendly method for pollutant elimination. 
      The specific objective is to investigate the enzymatic capabilities of Bacillus 
      albus, particularly the alpha/beta hydrolases (ABH), in degrading microplastics. 
      To achieve this, in-silico studies were conducted, including analysis of the ABH 
      protein sequence and its interaction with potential inhibitors targeting PVC 
      derivatives. Docking scores of - 7.2 kcal/mol were obtained to evaluate the 
      efficacy of the interactions. The study demonstrates the promising bioremediation 
      prospects of Bacillus albus for microplastics, highlighting its potential as a 
      key player in addressing microplastic pollution. The findings underscore the 
      urgent need for further experimental validation and practical implementation of 
      Bacillus albus in environmental remediation strategies.

AB  - This study explores the neuroprotective potential of hibiscetin concerning memory 
      deficits induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection in rats. The aim of this 
      study is to evaluate the effect of hibiscetin against LPS-injected memory 
      deficits in rats. The behavioral paradigms were conducted to access LPS-induced 
      memory deficits. Various biochemical parameters such as acetyl-cholinesterase 
      activity, choline-acetyltransferase, antioxidant (superoxide dismutase, 
      glutathione transferase, catalase), oxidative stress (malonaldehyde), and nitric 
      oxide levels were examined. Furthermore, neuroinflammatory parameters such as 
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and nuclear factor-kappa B 
      expression and brain-derived neurotrophic factor as well as apoptosis marker 
      i.e., caspase-3 were evaluated. The results demonstrated that the 
      hibiscetin-treated group exhibited significant recovery in LPS-induced memory 
      deficits in rats by using behavioral paradigms, biochemical parameters, 
      antioxidant levels, oxidative stress, neuroinflammatory markers, and apoptosis 
      markers. Recent research suggested that hibiscetin may serve as a promising 
      neuroprotective agent in experimental animals and could offer an alternative in 
      LPS-injected memory deficits in rodent models.

TI  - Effect of Azilsartan on clinical blood pressure reduction compared to other 
      angiotensin receptor blockers: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 958-967
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000001547 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertension has significantly contributed to morbidity and 
      mortality, necessitating effective management. Angiotensin receptor blockers 
      (ARBs) have emerged as a cornerstone in hypertension treatment. Azilsartan, a 
      relatively recent addition to the ARB family, offers unique characteristics, 
      including prodrug activation. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to 
      evaluate Azilsartan's role in reducing clinical blood pressure compared to other 
      ARBs and determine the most effective dosage. METHODS: Following PRISMA 
      guidelines, a comprehensive literature search was conducted in Medline, Web of 
      Science, Cochrane Library, and clinicaltrials.gov. Eligible studies included 
      adult hypertensive patients receiving Azilsartan compared to other ARBs, with 
      clinical systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) 
      outcomes. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed, and statistical 
      analysis employed comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software. RESULTS: Eleven 
      randomized controlled trials encompassing 18 studies involving 6024 patients were 
      included. Azilsartan demonstrated significant reductions in clinical SBP (mean 
      difference=-2.85 mmHg) and DBP (mean difference=-2.095 mmHg) compared to other 
      ARBs. Higher doses of Azilsartan showed greater efficacy, with 80 mg exhibiting 
      the most substantial reduction in SBP. The analysis emphasized the need for more 
      studies investigating lower Azilsartan doses (10 and 20 mg). CONCLUSION: This 
      systematic review and meta-analysis underscore Azilsartan's effectiveness in 
      reducing SBP and DBP. Dose-dependent effects emphasize the importance of optimal 
      dosing when prescribing Azilsartan. These findings provide valuable insights for 
      clinicians in managing hypertension effectively and call for further research, 
      primarily focusing on lower Azilsartan doses and a more diverse patient 
      population.

TI  - Identification and expression analysis of SBP-Box-like (SPL) gene family disclose 
      their contribution to abiotic stress and flower budding in pigeon pea (Cajanus 
      cajan).

AB  - The SPL gene family (for Squamosa Promoter-binding like Proteins) represents 
      specific transcription factors that have significant roles in abiotic stress 
      tolerance, development and the growth processes of different plants, including 
      initiation of the leaf, branching and development of shoot and fruits. The SPL 
      gene family has been studied in different plant species; however, its role is not 
      yet fully explored in pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan ). In the present study, 11 
      members of the CcSPL gene family were identified in C. cajan . The identified 
      SPLs were classified into nine groups based on a phylogenetic analysis involving 
      SPL protein sequences from C. cajan , Arabidopsis thaliana , Cicer arietinum , 
      Glycine max , Phaseolus vulgaris , Vigna unguiculata and Arachis hypogaea . 
      Further, the identification of gene structure, motif analysis, domain analysis 
      and presence of cis -regulatory elements in the SPL family members were studied. 
      Based on RNA-sequencing data, gene expression analysis was performed, revealing 
      that CcSPL2.1, 3 and 13A were significantly upregulated for salt-tolerance and 
      CcSPL14 and 15 were upregulated in a salt-susceptible cultivar. Real-time qPCR 
      validation indicated that CcSPL3, 4, 6 and 13A were upregulated under salt stress 
      conditions. Therefore, molecular docking was performed against the proteins of 
      two highly expressed genes (CcSPL3 and CcSPL14 ) with three ligands: abscisic 
      acid, gibberellic acid and indole-3-acetic acid. Afterward, their binding 
      affinity was obtained and three-dimensional structures were predicted. In the 
      future, our study may open avenues for harnessing CcSPL genes in pigeon pea for 
      enhanced abiotic stress resistance and developmental traits.

AB  - This study was conducted to evaluate how sterubin affects rotenone-induced 
      Parkinson's disease (PD) in rats. A total of 24 rats were distributed into 4 
      equal groups: normal saline control and rotenone control were administered saline 
      or rotenone (ROT), respectively, orally; sterubin 10 received ROT + sterubin 10 
      mg/kg po; and sterubin alone was administered to the test group (10 mg/kg). Rats 
      of the normal saline and sterubin alone groups received sunflower oil injection 
      (sc) daily, 1 h after receiving the treatments cited above, while rats of the 
      other groups received rotenone injection (0.5 mg/kg, sc). The treatment was 
      continued over the course of 28 days daily. On the 29th day, catalepsy and 
      akinesia were assessed. The rats were then euthanized, and the brain was 
      extracted for estimation of endogenous antioxidants (MDA: malondialdehyde, GSH: 
      reduced glutathione, CAT: catalase, SOD: superoxide dismutase), nitrative 
      (nitrite) stress markers, neuroinflammatory cytokines, and neurotransmitter 
      levels and their metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), dopamine 
      (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 
      and homovanillic acid (HVA)). Akinesia and catatonia caused by ROT reduced the 
      levels of endogenous antioxidants (GSH, CAT, and SOD), elevated the MDA level, 
      and altered the levels of nitrites, neurotransmitters, and their metabolites. 
      Sterubin restored the neurobehavioral deficits, oxidative stress, and metabolites 
      of altered neurotransmitters caused by ROT. Results demonstrated the 
      anti-Parkinson's activities of sterubin in ROT-treated rats.

AB  - The human gut microbiota (GM), which consists of a complex and diverse ecosystem 
      of bacteria, plays a vital role in overall wellness. However, the delicate 
      balance of this intricate system is being compromised by the widespread presence 
      of environmental toxins. The intricate connection between contaminants in the 
      environment and human well-being has garnered significant attention in recent 
      times. Although many environmental pollutants and their toxicity have been 
      identified and studied in laboratory settings and animal models, there is 
      insufficient data concerning their relevance to human physiology. Consequently, 
      research on the toxicity of environmental toxins in GM has gained prominence in 
      recent years. Various factors, such as air pollution, chemicals, heavy metals, 
      and pesticides, have a detrimental impact on the composition and functioning of 
      the GM. This comprehensive review aims to comprehend the toxic effects of 
      numerous environmental pollutants, including antibiotics, endocrine-disrupting 
      chemicals, heavy metals, and pesticides, on GM by examining recent research 
      findings. The current analysis concludes that different types of environmental 
      toxins can lead to GM dysbiosis and have various potential adverse effects on the 
      well-being of animals. We investigate the alterations to the GM composition 
      induced by contaminants and their impact on overall well-being, providing a fresh 
      perspective on research related to pollutant exposure.

TI  - Barbaloin's Chemical Intervention in Aluminum Chloride Induced Cognitive Deficits 
      and Changes in Rats through Modulation of Oxidative Stress, Cytokines, and BDNF 
      Expression.
PG  - 6976-6985
LID - 10.1021/acsomega.3c08791 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a long-term neurodegenerative condition characterized 
      by impaired cognitive functions, particularly in the domains of learning and 
      memory. Finding promising options for AD can be successful with a medication 
      repurposing strategy. The goal of the research was to examine the neuroprotective 
      characteristics of barbaloin in aluminum chloride (AlCl(3))-induced cognitive 
      deficits and changes in rats through modulation of oxidative stress, cytokines, 
      and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression. Thirty male Wistar rats 
      were subjected to AlCl(3) at a dosage of 100 mg/kg via the per oral route (p.o.), 
      which induced cognitive decline. Morris water maze (MWM) is used to assess 
      behavioral metrics. Assays for catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced 
      glutathione (GSH), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), 
      interleukins-1beta (IL-1beta), superoxide dismutase (SOD), tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
      (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), interleukins-6 (IL-6), BDNF, and 
      neurotransmitter levels [dopamine (DA), acetylcholine (Ach), and gamma-aminobutyric 
      acid (GABA)] were performed. Results: The transfer latency time was notably 
      decreased, and substantial modifications in the concentrations of GSH, MDA, CAT, 
      SOD, AChE, ChAT and observed modulations in the formation of interleukins-6 
      (IL-6), TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, BDNF, and NF-kappaB were also evidenced after the treatment of 
      rats with barbaloin in comparison to AlCl(3)-induced control groups. Significant 
      alterations in neurotransmitter levels (DA, Ach, and GABA) were also seen in 
      barbaloin-treated groups in comparison to AlCl(3)-induced groups. The current 
      investigation has provided evidence that the administration of barbaloin yielded 
      notable enhancements in cognitive function in rats through the inhibition of MDA, 
      enhancing endogenous antioxidant enzymes, reduction of cytokine levels, and 
      enhancement of neurotransmitter contents in the brain. These effects were 
      observed in comparison to a control group treated with AlCl(3) and can be 
      attributable to barbaloin's strong anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, 
      and metal chelating properties may contribute to its neuroprotective effects. 
      Barbaloin may also promote neuronal survival and enhance learning and memory by 
      upregulating the expression of BDNF.

TI  - Butin attenuates behavioral disorders via cholinergic/BDNF/Caspase-3 pathway in 
      scopolamine-evoked memory deficits in rats.
PG  - 981-994
LID - 35334 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_202402_35334 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent research suggests that butin may also exert neuroprotective 
      effects. However, its influence on cognitive performance and, specifically, its 
      potential to mitigate scopolamine-induced memory impairment remains unexplored. 
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of butin on the cognitive and 
      behavioral performance of rats with scopolamine-induced memory impairment. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Scopolamine-injected memory-impediment model in rats was 
      used to determine the efficacy of butin in higher and lower doses (10 and 20 
      mg/kg) for 14 days. Y-maze, along with Morris water, was used to assess the 
      ability to recall spatial and working information. Biochemistry-related functions 
      such as acetylcholinesterase, choline acetyltransferase, superoxide dismutase, 
      glutathione transferase, malonaldehyde, catalase, nitric oxide, and 
      neurotransmitters levels were estimated as indicators of free radical damage. 
      Furthermore, we evaluated neuro-inflammatory responses by assessing tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and caspase-3 immuno-reactive proteins. 
      RESULTS: When assessed through behavioral paradigms, the butin-treated group 
      enhanced the spatial and working memory of rodents. Scopolamine caused a 
      substantial alteration in biochemical-related parameters, neuronal enzymatic, 
      inflammation responses and apoptosis markers prominently restored by butin. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study concludes that butin protects scopolamine-injected rats 
      from behavioral impairments and neuronal damage by reducing apoptosis and 
      neuroinflammation.

LID - 1343928
AB  - Root architecture is an important agronomic trait that plays an essential role in 
      water uptake, soil compactions, nutrient recycling, plant-microbe interactions, 
      and hormone-mediated signaling pathways. Recently, significant advancements have 
      been made in understanding how the complex interactions of phytohormones regulate 
      the dynamic organization of root architecture in crops. Moreover, phytohormones, 
      particularly auxin, act as internal regulators of root development in soil, 
      starting from the early organogenesis to the formation of root hair (RH) through 
      diverse signaling mechanisms. However, a considerable gap remains in 
      understanding the hormonal cross-talk during various developmental stages of 
      roots. This review examines the dynamic aspects of phytohormone signaling, 
      cross-talk mechanisms, and the activation of transcription factors (TFs) 
      throughout various developmental stages of the root life cycle. Understanding 
      these developmental processes, together with hormonal signaling and molecular 
      engineering in crops, can improve our knowledge of root development under various 
      environmental conditions.

AB  - Over the past 15 years, there has been a noticeable uptick in incidents involving 
      children ingesting multiple magnetic foreign bodies which can cause injuries and 
      gastrointestinal complications including death. The current study aimed to 
      identify the prevalence, clinical presentation, and management of single or 
      multiple magnet ingestions. A retrospective multi-central cross-sectional study 
      was conducted to include all pediatric patients < 18 years presented to the 
      emergency department with ingestion of single or multiple magnets and admitted 
      across hospitals in Qatar, UAE, KSA, Tunisia, and Turkey between January 2011 and 
      December 2021. Demographics, symptoms, management, and outcomes were analyzed. 
      There were 189 magnet ingestions, of which 88 (46.6%) were multiple magnet 
      ingestions. Most patients (55.6%) were male, and the median age was 3.9 (IQR 2-7) 
      years. An abdominal X-ray was obtained in all cases. 119 (62%) patients were 
      conservatively treated, 53 (28%) required surgical intervention and 17 (8.9%) 
      underwent gastroscopy. None of the patients with single magnet ingestions 
      experienced morbidity or severe outcomes. Multiple magnet ingestions led to 
      significant morbidity including hospitalizations, perforations (44.3%), severe 
      intestinal necrosis (19.3%), peritonitis (13.6%), severe abdominal infection 
      (10.2%), and septic shock (4.5%). The rate of surgical intervention (59.1% vs. 
      1.0%) and gastroscopy (15.9% vs. 3.0%) was significantly higher in the multiple 
      ingestion group compared to the single magnet ingestion group. No deaths were 
      identified. A high risk of serious complications, including the need for surgery 
      to remove the magnets and substantial morbidity may result from swallowing more 
      than one magnet. Magnet safety requirements, public education, and improved 
      legislation are urgently required.

AB  - Aging-related diseases (ARDs) are a major global health concern, and the 
      development of effective therapies is urgently needed. Kaempferol, a flavonoid 
      found in several plants, has emerged as a promising candidate for ameliorating 
      ARDs. This comprehensive review examines Kaempferol's chemical properties, safety 
      profile, and pharmacokinetics, and highlights its potential therapeutic utility 
      against ARDs. Kaempferol's therapeutic potential is underpinned by its 
      distinctive chemical structure, which confers antioxidative and anti-inflammatory 
      properties. Kaempferol counteracts reactive oxygen species (ROS) and modulates 
      crucial cellular pathways, thereby combating oxidative stress and inflammation, 
      hallmarks of ARDs. Kaempferol's low toxicity and wide safety margins, as 
      demonstrated by preclinical and clinical studies, further substantiate its 
      therapeutic potential. Compelling evidence supports Kaempferol's substantial 
      potential in addressing ARDs through several mechanisms, notably 
      anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic actions. Kaempferol exhibits a 
      versatile neuroprotective effect by modulating various proinflammatory signaling 
      pathways, including NF-kB, p38MAPK, AKT, and the beta-catenin cascade. Additionally, 
      it hinders the formation and aggregation of beta-amyloid protein and regulates 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factors. In terms of its anticancer potential, 
      kaempferol acts through diverse pathways, inducing apoptosis, arresting the cell 
      cycle at the G2/M phase, suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      (EMT)-related markers, and affecting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase 
      B signaling pathways. Subsequent studies should focus on refining dosage 
      regimens, exploring innovative delivery systems, and conducting comprehensive 
      clinical trials to translate these findings into effective therapeutic 
      applications.

AB  - Sepsis, a potentially fatal illness caused by an improper host response to 
      infection, remains a serious problem in the world of healthcare. In recent years, 
      the role of ncRNA has emerged as a pivotal aspect in the intricate landscape of 
      cellular regulation. The exploration of ncRNA-mediated regulatory networks 
      reveals their profound influence on key molecular pathways orchestrating 
      pyroptotic responses during septic conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis 
      of current literature, we navigate the diverse classes of ncRNAs, including 
      miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, elucidating their roles as both facilitators and 
      inhibitors in the modulation of pyroptotic processes. Furthermore, we highlight 
      the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of targeting these ncRNAs 
      in the context of sepsis, aiming to cover the method for novel and effective 
      strategies to mitigate the devastating consequences of septic pathogenesis. As we 
      unravel the complexities of this regulatory axis, a deeper understanding of the 
      intricate crosstalk between ncRNAs and pyroptosis emerges, offering promising 
      avenues for advancing our approach to sepsis intervention. The intricate 
      pathophysiology of sepsis is examined in this review, which explores the dynamic 
      interaction between ncRNAs and pyroptosis, a highly regulated kind of programmed 
      cell death.

AB  - L. edodes (L. edodes) is the most consumed mushroom in the world and has been 
      well known for its therapeutic potential as an edible and medicinal candidate, it 
      contains dietary fibers, vitamins, proteins, minerals, and carbohydrates. In the 
      current study butanolic extract of mushroom was used to form semisolid butanol 
      extract. The current study aimed to explore biometabolites that might have 
      biological activities in n-butanol extract of L. edodes using FT-IR and GC-MS and 
      LC-MS. The synergistic properties of bioactive compounds were futher assessed by 
      performing different biological assays such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and 
      antidiabetic. FTIR spectra showed different functional groups including amide N-H 
      group, Alkane (C-H stretching), and (C = C stretching) groups at different 
      spectrum peaks in the range of 500 cm(-1) to 5000 cm(-1) respectively. GC-MS 
      profiling of n-butanol extract depicted 34 potent biomolecules among those 
      dimethyl; Morphine, 2TMS derivative; Benzoic acid, methyl ester 
      1-(2-methoxy-1-methylethoxy)-2-propanol were spotted at highest range. Results 
      indicate that L. edodes n-butanol extract showed a maximum anti-inflammatory 
      potential 91.4% at 300 mg/mL. Antioxidant activity was observed by measuring free 
      radical scavenging activity which is 64.6% at optimized concentration along with 
      good antidiabetic activity. In-silico study executed the biopotential of active 
      ingredient morphine which proved the best docking score (- 7.0 kJ/mol) against 
      aldose reductase. The in-silico drug design analysis was performed on 
      biometabolites detected through GC-MS that might be a potential target for 
      sulfatase-2 to treat ruminated arthritis. Morphine binds more strongly 
      (- 7.9 kJ/mol) than other bioactive constituents indicated. QSAR and ADMET 
      analysis shown that morphine is a good candidates against ruminated arthritis. 
      The current study showed that L. edodes might be used as potent drug molecules to 
      cure multiple ailments. As mushrooms have high bioactivity, they can be used 
      against different diseases and to develop antibacterial drugs based on the 
      current situation in the world in which drug resistance is going to increase due 
      to misuse of antibiotics so new and noval biological active compounds are needed 
      to overcome the situation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse fasting serum concentrations of G-17 in healthy individuals 
      to establish the reference intervals (RIs) in the Pakistani population. STUDY 
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional, observational study. Place and Duration of the Study: 
      Department of Clinical Chemistry and Immunology, Chughtai Institute of Pathology, 
      Lahore, Pakistan, from October to December 2022. METHODOLOGY: Fasting serum 
      samples from one hundred and twenty healthy individuals between the age of 18-65 
      years were collected according to the CLSI recommendations after taking written 
      informed consent. Samples were analysed on the auto-analyser for the quantitative 
      measurement of serum G-17 by sandwich chemiluminescence immunoassay. 
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to check normality. A p-value of <0.05 was 
      considered significant; 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles were computed using the 
      formula 0.025 (n+1) and 0.0975 (n+1), respectively. RESULTS: Of the 120 samples, 
      74 were obtained from male patients and 46 from females. The mean age was 30.2 
      +/-10.36 years. The histogram revealed a non-parametric distribution of the data. 
      The established reference intervals by the rank-based method were 2.31 pg/mL and 
      49.36 pg/mL which corresponds to 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, respectively. 
      These were markedly different from the Chinese reference ranges. CONCLUSION: 
      Ethnic and geographic variations affect the trends of RIs of Serum G-17. There is 
      a need to establish its population-specific RIs for G-17, so it can be used as a 
      non-invasive option in identifying patients requiring invasive endoscopic 
      intervention. KEY WORDS: Gastrin, Atrophic Gastritis, Biomarker, Reference 
      values.

TI  - Identification of bioactive compounds of Zanthoxylum armatum as potential 
      inhibitor of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2): Computational and virtual screening 
      approaches.

AB  - PKM2 (Pyruvate kinase M2) is the isoform of pyruvate kinase which is known to 
      catalyse the last step of glycolysis that is responsible for energy production. 
      This specific isoform is known to be highly expressed in certain cancerous 
      conditions. Considering the role of this protein in various cancer conditions, we 
      used PKM2 as a target protein to identify the potential compounds against this 
      target. In this study, we have examined 96 compounds of Zanthoxylum armatum using 
      an array of computational and in silico tools. The compounds were assessed for 
      toxicity then their anticancer potential was predicted. The virtual screening was 
      done with molecular docking followed by a detailed examination using molecular 
      dynamics simulation. The majority of the compounds showed a higher probability of 
      being antineoplastic. Based on toxicity, predicted anticancer potential, binding 
      affinity, and binding site, three compounds (nevadensin, asarinin, and 
      kaempferol) were selected as hit compounds. The binding energy of these compounds 
      with PKM2 ranged from -7.7 to -8.3 kcal/mol and all hit compounds interact at the 
      active site of the protein. The selected hit compounds formed a stable complex 
      with PKM2 when simulated under physiological conditions. The dynamic analysis 
      showed that these compounds remained attached to the active site till the 
      completion of molecular simulation. MM-PBSA analysis showed that nevadensin 
      exhibited a higher affinity towards PKM2 compared to asarinin and kaempferol. 
      These compounds need to be assessed properties in vivo and in vitro to validate 
      their efficacy.

AB  - Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have been recognized as key components in the intricate 
      regulatory network of the KRAS pathway across various cancers. The KRAS pathway, 
      a central signalling cascade crucial in tumorigenesis, has gained substantial 
      emphasis as a possible therapeutic target. CircRNAs, a subgroup of non-coding 
      RNAs known for their closed circular arrangement, play diverse roles in gene 
      regulation, contributing to the intricate landscape of cancer biology. This 
      review consolidates existing knowledge on circRNAs within the framework of the 
      KRAS pathway, emphasizing their multifaceted functions in cancer progression. 
      Notable circRNAs, such as Circ_GLG1 and circITGA7, have been identified as 
      pivotal regulators in colorectal cancer (CRC), influencing KRAS expression and 
      the Ras signaling pathway. Aside from their significance in gene regulation, 
      circRNAs contribute to immune evasion, apoptosis, and drug tolerance within 
      KRAS-driven cancers, adding complexity to the intricate interplay. While our 
      comprehension of circRNAs in the KRAS pathway is evolving, challenges such as the 
      diverse landscape of KRAS mutant tumors and the necessity for synergistic 
      combination therapies persist. Integrating cutting-edge technologies, including 
      deep learning-based prediction methods, holds the potential for unveiling 
      disease-associated circRNAs and identifying novel therapeutic targets. Sustained 
      research efforts are crucial to comprehensively unravel the molecular mechanisms 
      governing the intricate interplay between circRNAs and the KRAS pathway, offering 
      insights that could potentially revolutionize cancer diagnostics and treatment 
      strategies.

AB  - Pakistan, among the top five most water-stressed nations globally, grapples with 
      water scarcity owing to inadequate treatment infrastructure and groundwater 
      overextraction. We demonstrate a successful nature-based closed-loop system to 
      treat wastewater from urban vehicle-washing facilities, previously reliant on 
      groundwater. An eco-friendly integrated system containing floating treatment 
      wetlands (FTWs), subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF-CWs), and sand 
      filtration (SF) was designed and installed at three vehicle-washing facilities 
      for wastewater treatment and reuse in a loop. While the system is still 
      operational after years, a consistent and significant reduction in water quality 
      indicators is recorded, successfully meeting the national environmental quality 
      standards of Pakistan. By reducing per unit water treatment costs to as low as 
      $0.0163/m(3) and achieving payback periods under a year, the embrace of these 
      closed-loop strategies vividly underscores the imperative of transitioning to a 
      circular economy in the domains of wastewater treatment and resource 
      conservation.

TI  - The Effects of Online Home-Based Pilates Combined with Diet on Body Composition 
      in Women Affected by Obesity: A Preliminary Study.
LID - 10.3390/nu16060902 [doi]
LID - 902
AB  - Diet and exercise intervention are the first strategies to counteract obesity. An 
      online home-based exercise program may be a feasible approach in an obese 
      population. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of twelve 
      weeks of online Pilates plus diet on body composition in individuals affected by 
      obesity. Thirty-five females were randomly assigned to a home-based Pilates group 
      (PG, n = 18) or a group without intervention (control group, CG, n = 17). All 
      participants followed a Mediterranean diet. The PG followed a twelve-week online 
      Pilates Matwork program (three times/week; 180 min/week), while the CG was not 
      involved in any structured physical exercise program. Body composition and 
      handgrip strength were evaluated at baseline (T(0)) and after the intervention 
      (T(1)). A significant group x time interaction (p < 0.05) was found for the fat 
      mass percentage (pFM). Specifically, the pFM was significantly lower at T(1) than 
      at T(0) in the PG. Significant group x time interactions for fat-free mass (p < 
      0.05), appendicular skeletal muscle mass (p < 0.05), and skeletal muscle mass (p 
      < 0.01) were found. All these variables were significantly higher at T(1) than at 
      T(0) in the PG (p < 0.05). Home-based Pilates combined with diet intervention may 
      represent an effective strategy to improve body composition in terms of fat mass 
      reduction and muscle mass gain in adults affected by obesity.

TI  - Exploring ncRNA-mediated regulation of EGFR signalling in glioblastoma: From 
      mechanisms to therapeutics.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and deadly primary brain tumor type, 
      with a discouragingly low survival rate and few effective treatments. An 
      important function of the EGFR signalling pathway in the development of GBM is to 
      affect tumor proliferation, persistence, and treatment resistance. Advances in 
      molecular biology in the last several years have shown how important ncRNAs are 
      for controlling a wide range of biological activities, including cancer 
      progression and development. NcRNAs have become important post-transcriptional 
      regulators of gene expression, and they may affect the EGFR pathway by either 
      directly targeting EGFR or by modifying important transcription factors and 
      downstream signalling molecules. The EGFR pathway is aberrantly activated in 
      response to the dysregulation of certain ncRNAs, which has been linked to GBM 
      carcinogenesis, treatment resistance, and unfavourable patient outcomes. We 
      review the literature on miRNAs, circRNAs and lncRNAs that are implicated in the 
      regulation of EGFR signalling in GBM, discussing their mechanisms of action, 
      interactions with the signalling pathway, and implications for GBM therapy. 
      Furthermore, we explore the potential of ncRNA-based strategies to overcome 
      resistance to EGFR-targeted therapies, including the use of ncRNA mimics or 
      inhibitors to modulate the activity of key regulators within the pathway.

AB  - Memory loss or dementia is a progressive disorder, and one of its common forms is 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD), effecting mostly middle aged and older adults. In the 
      present study, we developed Rivastigmine (RIV) nanoparticles using 
      poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (RIV-loaded PLGA NPs) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). 
      The prepared RIV-PLGA nanoparticles was evaluated for the management of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). The nanoparticles were prepared by the slightly 
      modified nano-precipitation technique. The developed formulations were evaluated 
      for particle size, zeta potential (ZP), polydispersibility index (PDI) and 
      surface morphology and drug content. The experimental result revealed that 
      prepared RIV-loaded PLGA NPs (F1) was optimized having particle size 
      (61.2 +/- 4.6 nm), PDI (0.292), ZP (-11.2 +/- 1.2). SEM study confirms the prepared 
      nanoparticles depicted non-aggregated as well smooth surface particles without 
      any fracture. This formulation (F1) was further assessed for in vivo studies on 
      animal model. A pharmacological screening on an animal model of Alzheimer's 
      disease revealed that RIV-loaded PLGA NPs formulations treat CNS disorders like 
      Alzheimer's effectively. In addition to that, an in-vivo brain cholinesterase 
      estimation study found that, animals treated with optimized formulation 
      significantly (p < 0.01) reduced brain cholinesterase activity when compared to 
      scopolamine-treated animals. According to the above results, it can be concluded 
      that RIV-loaded PLGA NPs are ideal carriers for delivering the drug at a specific 
      target site in the brain, thus may treat Alzheimer's disease efficiently and 
      improve patient compliance.

TI  - The Effects of Heavy Metal Pollution on Soil Nitrogen Transformation and Rice 
      Volatile Organic Compounds under Different Water Management Practices.
LID - 10.3390/plants13060871 [doi]
LID - 871
AB  - One of the most concerning global environmental issues is the pollution of 
      agricultural soils by heavy metals (HMs), especially cadmium, which not only 
      affects human health through Cd-containing foods but also impacts the quality of 
      rice. The soil's nitrification and denitrification processes, coupled with the 
      release of volatile organic compounds by plants, raise substantial concerns. In 
      this review, we summarize the recent literature related to the deleterious 
      effects of Cd on both soil processes related to the N cycle and rice quality, 
      particularly aroma, in different water management practices. Under both 
      continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) conditions, 
      cadmium has been observed to reduce both the nitrification and denitrification 
      processes. The adverse effects are more pronounced in alternate wetting and 
      drying (AWD) as compared to continuous flooding (CF). Similarly, the alteration 
      in rice aroma is more significant in AWD than in CF. The precise modulation of 
      volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by Cd remains unclear based on the available 
      literature. Nevertheless, HM accumulation is higher in AWD conditions compared to 
      CF, leading to a detrimental impact on volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The 
      literature concludes that AWD practices should be avoided in Cd-contaminated 
      fields to decrease accumulation and maintain the quality of the rice. In the 
      future, rhizospheric engineering and plant biotechnology can be used to decrease 
      the transport of HMs from the soil to the plant's edible parts.

AB  - Lung inflammatory disorders are a major global health burden, impacting millions 
      of people and raising rates of morbidity and death across many demographic 
      groups. An industrial chemical and common environmental contaminant, formaldehyde 
      (FA) presents serious health concerns to the respiratory system, including the 
      onset and aggravation of lung inflammatory disorders. Epidemiological studies 
      have shown significant associations between FA exposure levels and the incidence 
      and severity of several respiratory diseases. FA causes inflammation in the 
      respiratory tract via immunological activation, oxidative stress, and airway 
      remodelling, aggravating pre-existing pulmonary inflammation and compromising 
      lung function. Additionally, FA functions as a respiratory sensitizer, causing 
      allergic responses and hypersensitivity pneumonitis in sensitive people. 
      Understanding the complicated processes behind formaldehyde-induced lung 
      inflammation is critical for directing targeted strategies aimed at minimizing 
      environmental exposures and alleviating the burden of formaldehyde-related lung 
      illnesses on global respiratory health. This abstract explores the intricate 
      relationship between FA exposure and lung inflammatory diseases, including 
      asthma, bronchitis, allergic inflammation, lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Dengue fever is a mosquito-bome illness that affects 
      millions of people worldwide every year. With no vaccination available, early 
      detection and treatment are critical. It is found in 112 countries and poses a 
      risk to travellers, particularly in metropolitan areas. Laboratory diagnoses vary 
      according to objectives, resources, and schedule, with sensitivity and 
      specificity must be balanced for effective testing. METHODS: The current study is 
      a cross-sectional diagnostic study and samples from suspected patients of dengue 
      was collected from May to November 2023 and transported to laboratory. RT-PCR and 
      Dengue Duo Rapid test diagnosis techniques were used and total 48 clinical 
      samples were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 48 clinical samples were 
      collected. Blood was collected from the suspected cases of dengue and further 
      subjected to different molecular and serological parameters. Serum was separated 
      from all blood samples. RNA was isolated by silica column extraction method which 
      is further utilized as a template for amplification and detection of dengue 
      serotyping. Master Mix was prepared for the amplification and detection of dengue 
      virus by Rotor-Gene Q Real-Time PCR Machine and further serological profiling of 
      positive dengue cases was studied by conventional PCR. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSION: 
      Our laboratory effectively standardized an RT-PCR-based approach for molecular 
      identification of dengue virus in clinical specimens. This adaptive technique, 
      which uses numerous primer sets, displayed good specificity and sensitivity in 
      serotype detection. The technology provides for quick and reliable identification 
      of dengue virus infections, allowing for targeted treatment and preventative 
      actions for successful disease management in highly populated regions.

TI  - Non-invasive Fibrosis Markers for Predicting Esophageal Varices: A Potential 
      Alternative to Endoscopic Screening.
PG  - e56433
LID - 10.7759/cureus.56433 [doi]
LID - e56433
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic liver infections and diseases lead to chronic liver injury, 
      which results in fibrosis. Due to this continuous scarring and regeneration, 
      cirrhosis occurs, which is also responsible for several adverse sequelae, 
      including but not limited to esophageal varices. Cirrhosis has resulted in 
      patients' increased morbidity and mortality, especially in low socioeconomic 
      settings such as Pakistan. Endoscopy is the gold standard for measuring the 
      presence or absence of esophageal varices, along with their grade. Currently, 
      some non-invasive markers (aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase 
      ratio (AAR), fibrosis 4 (FIB-4), AAR to platelet ratio index (AARPRI), aspartate 
      aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), S-index, King's score) are being 
      established that make use of laboratory tests, such as a complete blood profile, 
      liver function profile, and coagulation profile, to estimate the extent of 
      hepatic fibrosis. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to establish a 
      correlation between non-invasive markers of fibrosis and the presence of 
      esophageal varices and to assess their potential as a substitute for 
      gastrointestinal endoscopy screening. Additionally, the study aims to compare 
      these six scores, thereby generating data on their individual and relative 
      accuracy. METHODOLOGY: This was a cross-sectional study conducted at the Shalamar 
      Institute of Health Sciences, Lahore, Pakistan. Outpatient (OPD) data were 
      obtained from the Shalamar online portal system from June 2022 to December 2022. 
      Laboratory tests, abdominal ultrasounds, and endoscopy results were accessed and 
      recorded in the questionnaire. The patient's medical records and contact numbers 
      were also noted in case further questions arose. Data were then compiled into a 
      Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA) and analyzed after 
      computing the non-invasive procedure formulas. It was analyzed using IBM SPSS 
      Statistics for Windows, version 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). P-values were 
      calculated, and conclusions were drawn. RESULTS: Of the sample size of 100 
      patients with liver damage and injury, 60% were male and 40% were female. Among 
      males, 15% had a milder (grade 1) degree of esophageal varices, and 45% had a 
      moderate to advanced degree (grades 2-3) of esophageal varices. Among females, 
      19% had mild (grade 1) varices, while 21% had severe (grade 3) varices. The most 
      common cause of varices in patients who had developed fibrosis and/or cirrhosis 
      was hepatitis C, with a wide margin of other causes. The p-values obtained showed 
      that from the selected list of non-invasive markers of fibrosis, only FIB-4 and 
      AARPRI were statistically significant with p-values of 0.036 and 0.022, 
      respectively. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Though endoscopy is currently the 
      gold-standard procedure for detecting the presence or absence and grade of 
      esophageal varices, it is invasive, which makes the patients extremely 
      uncomfortable and apprehensive. It can also lead to post-procedure infection, 
      internal hemorrhages, and trauma due to instrument use. Due to its invasive 
      nature, some patients also tend to refuse this procedure. Non-invasive fibrosis 
      markers can help make a diagnosis without undergoing an endoscopy, which in turn 
      will improve patient compliance and satisfaction. CONCLUSION: It was observed 
      that FIB-4 and AARPRI can be used together as reliable markers to assess the 
      presence or absence of esophageal varices.

AB  - Pot experiment was performed aimed to assess the comparative role of charcoal, 
      biochar, hydrochar and thiourea-vegetable modified biochar at 1 and 2 % doses, 
      and <1 mm particle size on the bioavailability of Cd, Pb, As, Ni, Cu and Zn, and 
      enhance NPK, and mustard growth in a slightly alkaline polluted soil. 
      Furthermore, machine learning method was used to examine the systematic 
      evaluation of the impact of feature selection based on Pearson's correlation on 
      the performance of the linear regression model. The results revealed that maximum 
      fresh and dry biomass of mustard was observed by 26.38 and 38.18 % with hydrochar 
      1 %, whereas lemon biochar at 2 % reduced fresh and dry biomass up to 34.0 and 
      53.0 % than control. The immobilization of Cd and Pb was observed by 83.70 and 
      71.15 % with thiourea-vegetable modified biochar at 2 %, As 71.62 % with 
      hydrochar 2 %, Ni 80.84 % with thiourea-vegetable modified biochar 2 %, Cu 
      66.32 % with and Zn 36.30 % with thiourea-vegetable modified biochar at 2 % than 
      control. However, the maximum mobilization of Cu in soil was observed by 30.3 % 
      with lemon biochar 2 %, similarly for Zn 37.36 % with hydrochar 2 % as compared 
      with other treatments. The phyto-availability of Cd, Pb, As and Cu in the mustard 
      shoot and root biomass was reduced except Ni and Zn in soil than control. It was 
      observed that using the machine learning regression analysis approach, 
      variability in treatments effectiveness is evident across different feature 
      correlation thresholds. This study clearly shows that the beneficial role of 
      studied amendments on mustard growth and reduced bioavailability of heavy 
      metal(loid)s and enhance primary macronutrients in alkaline polluted soil. It is 
      suggested that future studies may be conducted on combined application of studies 
      amendments on plant growth, immobilization of heavy metal(loid)s in multi-metal 
      polluted soil under different field conditions.

AB  - Fibrosarcoma is a challenging cancer originating from fibrous tissues, marked by 
      aggressive growth and limited treatment options. The discovery of non-coding RNAs 
      (ncRNAs), including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and small 
      interfering RNAs (siRNAs), has opened new pathways for understanding and treating 
      this malignancy. These ncRNAs play crucial roles in gene regulation, cellular 
      processes, and the tumor microenvironment. This review aims to explore the impact 
      of ncRNAs on fibrosarcoma's pathogenesis, progression, and resistance to 
      treatment, focusing on their mechanistic roles and therapeutic potential. A 
      comprehensive review of literature from databases like PubMed and Google Scholar 
      was conducted, focusing on the dysregulation of ncRNAs in fibrosarcoma, their 
      contribution to tumor growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and their cellular 
      pathway interactions. NcRNAs significantly influence fibrosarcoma, affecting cell 
      proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and angiogenesis. Their function as oncogenes 
      or tumor suppressors makes them promising biomarkers and therapeutic targets. 
      Understanding their interaction with the tumor microenvironment is essential for 
      developing more effective treatments for fibrosarcoma. Targeting ncRNAs emerges 
      as a promising strategy for fibrosarcoma therapy, offering hope to overcome the 
      shortcomings of existing treatments. Further investigation is needed to clarify 
      specific ncRNAs' roles in fibrosarcoma and to develop ncRNA-based therapies, 
      highlighting the significance of ncRNAs in improving patient outcomes in this 
      challenging cancer.

AB  - Defending against future pandemics requires vaccine platforms that protect across 
      a range of related pathogens. Nanoscale patterning can be used to address this 
      issue. Here, we produce quartets of linked receptor-binding domains (RBDs) from a 
      panel of SARS-like betacoronaviruses, coupled to a computationally designed 
      nanocage through SpyTag/SpyCatcher links. These Quartet Nanocages, possessing a 
      branched morphology, induce a high level of neutralizing antibodies against 
      several different coronaviruses, including against viruses not represented in the 
      vaccine. Equivalent antibody responses are raised to RBDs close to the nanocage 
      or at the tips of the nanoparticle's branches. In animals primed with SARS-CoV-2 
      Spike, boost immunizations with Quartet Nanocages increase the strength and 
      breadth of an otherwise narrow immune response. A Quartet Nanocage including the 
      Omicron XBB.1.5 'Kraken' RBD induced antibodies with binding to a broad range of 
      sarbecoviruses, as well as neutralizing activity against this variant of concern. 
      Quartet nanocages are a nanomedicine approach with potential to confer 
      heterotypic protection against emergent zoonotic pathogens and facilitate 
      proactive pandemic protection.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the primary reasons for fatalities caused 
      by cancer globally, highlighting the need for comprehensive knowledge of its 
      molecular aetiology to develop successful treatment approaches. The PI3K/Akt 
      system is essential in the course of HCC, rendering it an intriguing candidate 
      for treatment. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), such as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), and circular RNAs (circRNAs), are important mediators of the PI3K/Akt 
      network in HCC. The article delves into the complex regulatory functions of 
      ncRNAs in influencing the PI3K/Akt system in HCC. The study explores how lncRNAs, 
      miRNAs, and circRNAs impact the expression as well as the function of the 
      PI3K/Akt network, either supporting or preventing HCC growth. Additionally, 
      treatment strategies focusing on ncRNAs in HCC are examined, such as antisense 
      oligonucleotide-based methods, RNA interference, and small molecule inhibitor 
      technologies. Emphasizing the necessity of ensuring safety and effectiveness in 
      clinical settings, limitations, and future approaches in using ncRNAs as 
      therapies for HCC are underlined. The present study offers useful insights into 
      the complex regulation system of ncRNAs and the PI3K/Akt cascade in HCC, 
      suggesting possible opportunities for developing innovative treatment approaches 
      to address this lethal tumor.

AB  - Parkinson's Disease (PD) is a complex neurological illness that causes severe 
      motor and non-motor symptoms due to a gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the 
      substantia nigra. The aetiology of PD is influenced by a variety of genetic, 
      environmental, and cellular variables. One important aspect of this 
      pathophysiology is autophagy, a crucial cellular homeostasis process that breaks 
      down and recycles cytoplasmic components. Recent advances in genomic technologies 
      have unravelled a significant impact of ncRNAs on the regulation of autophagy 
      pathways, thereby implicating their roles in PD onset and progression. They are 
      members of a family of RNAs that include miRNAs, circRNA and lncRNAs that have 
      been shown to play novel pleiotropic functions in the pathogenesis of PD by 
      modulating the expression of genes linked to autophagic activities and 
      dopaminergic neuron survival. This review aims to integrate the current genetic 
      paradigms with the therapeutic prospect of autophagy-associated ncRNAs in PD. By 
      synthesizing the findings of recent genetic studies, we underscore the importance 
      of ncRNAs in the regulation of autophagy, how they are dysregulated in PD, and 
      how they represent novel dimensions for therapeutic intervention. The therapeutic 
      promise of targeting ncRNAs in PD is discussed, including the barriers that need 
      to be overcome and future directions that must be embraced to funnel these ncRNA 
      molecules for the treatment and management of PD.

TI  - Malvidin attenuates behavioral and inhibits the TNF-alpha/Caspase-3/Nrf-2 expression 
      in rotenone-induced Parkinson's disease in rats: insights from molecular docking.
PG  - 3330-3346

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Malvidin is a natural, biologically active polyphenol found in several 
      fruits. It exhibits several therapeutic benefits; however, limited studies are 
      available on its effects on neurodegenerative clinical conditions, including 
      Parkinson's disease. The study aimed to investigate the therapeutic properties of 
      malvidin on rotenone-triggered Parkinson's disease in an animal model. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: To determine the effects of malvidin, rotenone (1.5 mg/kg) was 
      injected subcutaneously into Wistar rats for 21 days, followed by a dose of 
      malvidin (200 and 100 mg/kg). Behavioral tests were performed on the experimental 
      animals before sacrifice. On the 22nd day of the experiment, biochemical tests 
      were performed, including superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), 
      malondialdehyde (MDA), and catalase (CAT). The activity of neurotransmitters and 
      their metabolites, including acetylcholine (ACh), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
      dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-HT), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic 
      acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) 
      along with neuroinflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor- alpha (TNF-alpha), and nuclear factor 
      erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2) were estimated. Moreover, the level of the 
      apoptotic marker, caspase-3, was also estimated. In addition, molecular docking 
      was performed. RESULTS: The administration of rotenone resulted in oxidative 
      stress, cholinergic imbalances, dopaminergic alternations, and increased 
      expression of inflammatory compounds. The docking analysis revealed that malvidin 
      displayed a favorable binding affinity for AChE, showcasing a binding energy of 
      -9.329 Kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: The investigation concludes that malvidin exhibits 
      neuroprotective effects due to its curative effects against inflammation and 
      oxidative stress. These findings suggest that malvidin possesses therapeutic 
      potential against rotenone-triggered behavioral, oxidative, and inflammatory 
      abnormalities in rodents.

TI  - Comparison of Endoscopic Ultrasound and Transabdominal Ultrasound in the 
      Detection of Gallbladder and Common Bile Duct Microlithiasis.
PG  - e58756

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is an emerging method with a wide 
      range of potential uses in gastroenterology, including the detection of bile duct 
      stones and the identification of early ductal alterations in suspected patients. 
      This study was designed to compare the diagnostic yield of EUS and transabdominal 
      ultrasound (TUS) in the detection of gallbladder and common bile duct (CBD) 
      microlithiasis. METHOD: Patients with biliary colic with normal initial TUS were 
      the subjects of this prospective study. EUS scan was performed on all recruited 
      patients and linear endoscopes were used for the EUS examination. Cholecystectomy 
      and histological analysis were done in patients within two weeks after EUS 
      revealing cholelithiasis whereas the cases of CBD stone/microlithiasis were 
      confirmed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The mean 
      values of all hematological characteristics were independently determined for 
      males and females and then compared using Student's t-test. For statistical 
      significance, a p-value of 0.05 or below was used. RESULTS: A total of 131 
      patients, including 77 females and 54 males, with a mean age of 38.41 +/- 14.78 
      years were examined. All 78 (59.5%) individuals who had cholecystectomy were 
      found to have gallstones or microlithiasis as successfully diagnosed by EUS. The 
      sensitivity and specificity of EUS were 92.9% and 100%, respectively, for CBD 
      stones and 98.8% and 100%, respectively, for the detection of gallbladder 
      microlithiasis. The agreement between EUS and TUS was fair for CBD stones (kappa = 
      0.214) and very weak for microlithiasis (kappa = -0.093). CONCLUSION: 
      EUS demonstrates a superior yield over TUS in detecting gallbladder stones and 
      CBD microlithiasis, offering a more reliable diagnostic modality. LIMITATION: 
      This was a single-center study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological condition 
      marked by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars 
      compacta. The precise etiology of PD remains unclear, but emerging evidence 
      suggests a significant role for disrupted autophagy-a crucial cellular process 
      for maintaining protein and organelle integrity. METHODS: This review focuses on 
      the role of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in modulating autophagy in PD. We conducted 
      a comprehensive review of recent studies to explore how ncRNAs influence 
      autophagy and contribute to PD pathophysiology. Special attention was given to 
      the examination of ncRNAs' regulatory impacts in various PD models and patient 
      samples. RESULTS: Findings reveal that ncRNAs are pivotal in regulating key 
      processes associated with PD progression, including autophagy, alpha-synuclein 
      aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Dysregulation of 
      specific ncRNAs appears to be closely linked to these pathogenic processes. 
      CONCLUSION: ncRNAs hold significant therapeutic potential for addressing 
      autophagy-related mechanisms in PD. The review highlights innovative therapeutic 
      strategies targeting autophagy-related ncRNAs and discusses the challenges and 
      prospective directions for developing ncRNA-based therapies in clinical practice. 
      The insights from this study underline the importance of ncRNAs in the molecular 
      landscape of PD and their potential in novel treatment approaches.

AB  - Fire blight, a devastating disease caused by Erwinia amylovora, poses a 
      significant threat to pear and apple trees in Xinjiang province, China. In an 
      effort to combat this pathogen, we isolated 10 bacteria from various components 
      of apple and crabapple trees and conducted screenings to assess their ability to 
      inhibit E. amylovora in vitro. Through biochemical tests and partial 16S rRNA 
      gene sequencing, we identified two promising strains, Priestia megaterium strain 
      H1 and Bacillus subtilis strain I2. These strains were then evaluated for their 
      efficacy in biocontrol under controlled laboratory conditions, focusing on 
      immature fruits and leaves. Remarkably, all selected antagonists exhibited the 
      capability to reduce the severity of the disease on both fruit and leaves. P. 
      megaterium strain H1 and B. subtilis strain I2 exhibited significant reductions 
      in disease incidence on both immature fruits and leaves compared to the control. 
      Specifically, on immature fruits, they achieved reductions of 53.39% and 44.76%, 
      respectively, while on leaves, they demonstrated reductions of 59.55% and 55.53%, 
      respectively. Furthermore, during the study, we detected the presence of 
      lipopeptides, including surfactin, iturins, bacillomycin D, and fengycins, in the 
      methanol extract obtained from these two antagonistic bacteria using thin-layer 
      chromatography (TLC). Based on the results obtained, B. subtilis strain I2 and P. 
      megaterium strain H1 exhibit considerable potential for controlling fire blight. 
      However, further evaluation of their efficacy under natural field conditions is 
      essential to validate their practicality as a biocontrol method.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Soil salinization poses a significant environmental challenge 
      affecting plant growth and agricultural sustainability. This study explores the 
      potential of salt-tolerant endophytes to mitigate the adverse effects of soil 
      salinization, emphasizing their impact on the development and resistance of 
      Arachis hypogaea L. (peanuts). METHODS: The diversity of culturable plant 
      endophytic bacteria associated with Miscanthus lutarioriparius was investigated. 
      The study focused on the effects of Bacillus tequilensis, Staphylococcus 
      epidermidis, and Bacillus siamensis on the development and germination of A. 
      hypogaea seeds in pots subjected to high NaCl concentrations (200 mM L(-1)). 
      RESULTS: Under elevated NaCl concentrations, the inoculation of endophytes 
      significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced seedling germination and increased the 
      activities of enzymes such as Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and polyphenol 
      oxidase, while reducing malondialdehyde and peroxidase levels. Additionally, 
      endophyte inoculation resulted in increased root surface area, plant height, 
      biomass contents, and leaf surface area of peanuts under NaCl stress. 
      Transcriptome data revealed an augmented defense and resistance response induced 
      by the applied endophyte (B. tequilensis, S. epidermidis, and B. siamensis) 
      strain, including upregulation of abiotic stress related mechanisms such as fat 
      metabolism, hormones, and glycosyl inositol phosphorylceramide (Na(+) receptor). 
      Na(+) receptor under salt stress gate Ca(2+) influx channels in plants. Notably, 
      the synthesis of secondary metabolites, especially genes related to terpene and 
      phenylpropanoid pathways, was highly regulated. CONCLUSION: The inoculated 
      endophytes played a possible role in enhancing salt tolerance in peanuts. Future 
      investigations should explore protein-protein interactions between plants and 
      endophytes to unravel the mechanisms underlying endophyte-mediated salt 
      resistance in plants.

AB  - Water pollution caused by antibiotics and synthetic dyes and imminent energy 
      crises due to limited fossil fuel resources are issues of contemporary decades. 
      Herein, we address them by enabling the multifunctionality in dual Z-scheme 
      MoS(2)/WO(3-x)/AgBiS(2) across photolysis, photo Fenton-like, and night 
      catalysis. Defect, basal, and facet-engineered WO(3-x) is modified with MoS(2) 
      and AgBiS(2), which extended its photoresponse from the UV-NIR region, inhibited 
      carrier recombination, and reduced carrier transfer resistance. The electric 
      field rearrangement leads to a flow of electrons from MoS(2) and AgBiS(2) to 
      WO(3-x) and intensifies the electron population, which is crucial for night 
      catalysis. When MoS(2)/WO(3-x)/AgBiS(2) was employed against doxycycline 
      hydrochloride (DOXH), it removed 95.65, 81.11, and 77.92 % of DOXH in 100 min 
      during photo-Fenton (PFR), night-Fenton (NFR), and photocatalytic (PCR) 
      reactions, respectively. It also effectively removed 91.91, 98.17, 99.01, and 
      98.99 % of rhodamine B (RhB), Congo red (CR), methylene blue (MB), and methylene 
      orange (MO) in Fenton reactions, respectively. ESR analysis consolidates the ROS 
      generation feature of MoS(2)/WO(3-x)/AgBiS(2) using H(2)O(2) with and without 
      irradiation. This work provides a strategy to eliminate the deficiencies of 
      WO(3-x) and is conducive to the evolution of applications seeking to combat 
      environmental and energy crises.

AB  - Cancer poses intricate challenges to treatment due to its complexity and 
      diversity. Ferroptosis and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as innovative 
      therapeutic avenues amid the evolving landscape of cancer therapy. Extensive 
      investigations into circRNAs reveal their diverse roles, ranging from molecular 
      regulators to pivotal influencers of ferroptosis in cancer cell lines. The 
      results underscore the significance of circRNAs in modulating molecular pathways 
      that impact crucial aspects of cancer development, including cell survival, 
      proliferation, and metastasis. A detailed analysis delineates these pathways, 
      shedding light on the molecular mechanisms through which circRNAs influence 
      ferroptosis. Building upon recent experimental findings, the study evaluates the 
      therapeutic potential of targeting circRNAs to induce ferroptosis. By identifying 
      specific circRNAs associated with the etiology of cancer, this analysis paves the 
      way for the development of targeted therapeutics that exploit vulnerabilities in 
      cancer cells. This review consolidates the existing understanding of ferroptosis 
      and circRNAs, emphasizing their role in cancer therapy and providing impetus for 
      ongoing research in this dynamic field. See also the graphical abstract(Fig. 1).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) has the potential to improve health 
      outcomes, but EBM has not been widely integrated into the systems used for 
      research or clinical decision-making. There has not been a scalable and reusable 
      computer-readable standard for distributing research results and synthesized 
      evidence among creators, implementers, and the ultimate users of that evidence. 
      Evidence that is more rapidly updated, synthesized, disseminated, and implemented 
      would improve both the delivery of EBM and evidence-based health care policy. 
      OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to introduce the EBM on Fast Healthcare 
      Interoperability Resources (FHIR) project (EBMonFHIR), which is extending the 
      methods and infrastructure of Health Level Seven (HL7) FHIR to provide an 
      interoperability standard for the electronic exchange of health-related 
      scientific knowledge. METHODS: As an ongoing process, the project creates and 
      refines FHIR resources to represent evidence from clinical studies and syntheses 
      of those studies and develops tools to assist with the creation and visualization 
      of FHIR resources. RESULTS: The EBMonFHIR project created FHIR resources (ie, 
      ArtifactAssessment, Citation, Evidence, EvidenceReport, and EvidenceVariable) for 
      representing evidence. The COVID-19 Knowledge Accelerator (COKA) project, now 
      Health Evidence Knowledge Accelerator (HEvKA), took this work further and created 
      FHIR resources that express EvidenceReport, Citation, and ArtifactAssessment 
      concepts. The group is (1) continually refining FHIR resources to support the 
      representation of EBM; (2) developing controlled terminology related to EBM (ie, 
      study design, statistic type, statistical model, and risk of bias); and (3) 
      developing tools to facilitate the visualization and data entry of EBM 
      information into FHIR resources, including human-readable interfaces and JSON 
      viewers. CONCLUSIONS: EBMonFHIR resources in conjunction with other FHIR 
      resources can support relaying EBM components in a manner that is interoperable 
      and consumable by downstream tools and health information technology systems to 
      support the users of evidence.

TI  - Barbaloin Protects Pentylenetetrazol-Induced Cognitive Deficits in Rodents via 
      Modulation of Neurotransmitters and Inhibition of Oxidative-Free-Radicals-Led 
      Inflammation.
LID - 10.3390/ph17060699 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epilepsy is defined by an excessive level of activity in the neurons 
      and coordinated bursts of electrical activity, resulting in the occurrence of 
      seizure episodes. The precise cause of epileptogenesis remains uncertain; 
      nevertheless, the etiology of epilepsy may involve neuroinflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and malfunction of the neurotransmitter system. OBJECTIVE: The goal of 
      this investigation was to assess barbaloin's protective properties with respect 
      to pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-)-induced cognitive deficits in rats via 
      antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and neurotransmitter-modulating effects. 
      METHODS: Wistar rats were subjected to PTZ [40 mg/kg (i.p.)], which induced 
      cognitive decline. Behavior assessment using a kindling score, open-field test 
      (OFT), novel object recognition test (NORT), and assays for superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA), 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE), caspase-3, nitric oxide (NO), interleukins-1beta 
      (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-6, nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), 
      Bcl-2 and Bax, and neurotransmitter levels [GABA, DA, NE, and serotonin (5-HT)] 
      were performed. RESULTS: The treatment of rats with barbaloin resulted in 
      behavior improvement and significant changes in the levels of GSH, SOD, CAT, MDA, 
      AChE, NO, IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, NF-kappaB, caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax compared to the 
      PTZ control group. Barbaloin treatment resulted in notable changes in 
      neurotransmitter levels (GABA, NE, 5-HT, DA) compared to the PTZ group. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The ongoing study has gathered evidence indicating that the 
      injection of barbaloin has resulted in significant improvements in cognitive 
      performance in rats. This is achieved by inhibiting oxidative stress, enhancing 
      the activity of natural antioxidant enzymes, reducing cytokine levels, and 
      increasing the levels of neurotransmitters in the brain. These results were 
      detected in comparison to a PTZ control and can be attributed to the potent 
      anti-inflammatory and antioxidant capabilities of barbaloin, which could be 
      linked to its neuroprotective properties. Barbaloin may potentially increase 
      cognitive decline and boost neuronal survival by altering the expression of Bax, 
      caspase-3, Bcl-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) is well recognized as a psychostimulant that can 
      cause neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration, which is associated with cognitive 
      decline, has been confirmed experimentally. OBJECTIVE: The research aimed to 
      investigate the neuroprotective properties of europinidin (Eu) in rodents 
      affected by methamphetamine (MA)-induced cognitive impairments and hippocampal 
      alterations. This was achieved by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and 
      pro-inflammatory markers. METHODS: Rats were exposed to cognitive impairment 
      produced by MA. The Morris water maze (MWM) is utilized to evaluate behavioral 
      parameters. Biochemical tests were conducted on malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase 
      (CAT), interleukins-1beta (IL-1beta), reduced glutathione (GSH), tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and the expression of 
      neurotransmitters (Norepinephrine [NE], dopamine [DA], glutamate, and 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) as well as cAMP response element- binding protein 
      (CREB), IL-6, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and caspase 3 proteins. 
      An investigation was carried out using docking methodology to ascertain whether 
      Eu interacts with relevant molecular targets. RESULTS: Significant decline in the 
      transfer latency and there were significant changes in the amount of SOD, GSH, 
      CAT, and MDA and alterations in levels of IL-6, IL-1beta, CREB, TNF-alpha, BDNF, and 
      Caspase 3 proteins expression. Furthermore, considerably restored level of 
      neurotransmitters (NE, DA, Glutamate, and GABA) were observed in the Eu-treated 
      rats compared to the MA-induced rats. Eu had a favorable affinity towards BDNF 
      with docking scores of -9.486 kcal/mol. CONCLUSION: The experiment found that 
      administering Eu to rats improved cognitive abilities by changing antioxidant 
      enzymes, reducing cytokines, and modifying neurotransmitter levels, compared to 
      rats in the control group treated with MA.

AB  - The novel dataset called Linux-APT Dataset 2024 captures Advanced Persistent 
      Threat (APT) attacks along with other latest and sophisticated payloads. Existing 
      datasets lacks latest attacker's techniques and procedures, APTs tactics and 
      configuration to capture maximum Linux log sources to observe the working and 
      behaviour of an APT in a detailed manner. The environment which supported us in 
      capturing the logs is composed of Linux machines and a centralized logging system 
      configured appropriately to captures and detect all possible events and logs for 
      an APT and other complex intrusion. Unlike Microsoft Windows, Linux logging 
      system are investigated enough and usually systems relies on limited log sources 
      but for an APT, all possible log sources should be evaluated and added to 
      completely analyse the behaviour, trajectory, and operation of an APT. To keep 
      the dataset up to date and realistic, recent payloads and APTs are emulated in 
      the environment. A well-known cyber-security framework 'MITRE ATT&CK' is utilised 
      to map the behaviour and operation in a generalized manner after capturing the 
      events and logs. This dataset can be used for training and conducting a variety 
      of experiments to build as well as design the solutions for detecting most recent 
      intrusions and APT attacks for Linux System.

AB  - During the summer of 2023, the European Region experienced a limited resurgence 
      of mpox cases following the substantial outbreak in 2022. This increase was 
      characterised by asynchronous and bimodal increases, with countries experiencing 
      peaks at different times. The demographic profile of cases during the resurgence 
      was largely consistent with those reported previously. All available sequences 
      from the European Region belonged to clade IIb. Sustained efforts are crucial to 
      control and eventually eliminate mpox in the European Region.

AB  - Glioblastoma (GB) remains a formidable challenge and requires new treatment 
      strategies. The vital part of the Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in cellular 
      regulation has positioned it as a potentially crucial target in GB treatment, 
      given its dysregulation oncolines. The Ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) in the 
      UPS system were considered due to the garden role in the cellular processes 
      associated with oncolines and their vital function in the apoptotic process, cell 
      cycle regulation, and autophagy. The article provides a comprehensive summary of 
      the evidence base for targeting USPs as potential factors for neoplasm treatment. 
      The review considers the participation of the UPS system in the development, 
      resulting in the importance of p53, Rb, and NF-kappaB, and evaluates specific goals 
      for therapeutic administration using midnight proteasomal inhibitors and small 
      molecule antagonists of E1 and E2 enzymes. Despite the slowed rate of drug 
      creation, recent therapeutic discoveries based on USP system dynamics hold 
      promise for specialized therapies. The review concludes with an analysis of 
      future wanderers and the feasible effects of targeting USPs on personalized GB 
      therapies, which can improve patient hydration in this current and unattractive 
      therapeutic landscape. The manuscript emphasizes the possibility of USP oncogene 
      therapy as a promising alternative treatment line for GB. It stresses the direct 
      creation of research on the medical effectiveness of the approach.

TI  - Synthesis, Characterization, Phytochemistry, and Therapeutic Potential of 
      Azadirachta indica Conjugated Silver Nanoparticles: A Comprehensive Study on 
      Antidiabetic and Antioxidant Properties.
PG  - 2170-2185

AB  - Nanotechnology has become a major topic of study, particularly in the medical and 
      health domains. Because nanomedicine has a higher recovery rate than other 
      conventional drugs, it has attracted more attention. Green synthesis is the most 
      efficient and sustainable method of creating nanoparticles. The current work used 
      ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 
      scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray, and X-ray diffraction to 
      thoroughly characterize the synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from 
      Azadirachta indica leaf extract. Characterization confirmed the synthesis of the 
      AgNPs along with the possible linkage of the phytochemicals with the silver as 
      well as the quantitative analysis and nature of NPs. The antioxidant activity of 
      AgNPs and neem extract was measured by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl assay 
      using various concentrations (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 microg/ml). Additionally, using 
      diabetic mice that had been given alloxan, the in vivo antidiabetic potential of 
      biosynthesized AgNPs was assessed. Eight groups of mice were used to assess the 
      antidiabetic activity: one control group and seven experimental groups 
      (untreated, extract-treated, AgNPs at low and high doses, standard drug, low dose 
      of AgNPs + drug, and high dose of AgNPs + drug). At days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28, 
      blood glucose levels and body weight were measured. After 28 days, the mice were 
      dissected, and the liver, kidney, and pancreas were examined histologically. The 
      results depicted that the AgNPs showed higher (significant) radical scavenging 
      activity (IC(50) = 35.2 microg/ml) than extract (IC(50) = 93.0 microg/ml) and ascorbic 
      acid (IC(50) = 64.6 microg/ml). The outcomes demonstrated that biosynthesized AgNPs 
      had a great deal of promise as an antidiabetic agent and exhibited remarkable 
      effects in diabetic mice given AgNPs, extract, and drug. Remarkable improvement 
      in the body weight and blood glucose level of mice treated with high doses of 
      AgNPs and drug was observed. The body weight and blood glucose level of diabetic 
      mice treated with a high dose of AgNPs + standard drug showed significant 
      improvement, going from 28.7 +/- 0.2 to 35.6 +/- 0.3 g and 248 +/- 0.3 to 
      109 +/- 0.1 mg/dl, respectively. Significant regeneration was also observed in the 
      histomorphology of the kidney, liver's central vein, and islets of Langerhans 
      after treatment with biosynthesized AgNPs. Diabetic mice given a high dose of 
      AgNPs and drug displayed architecture of the kidney, liver, and pancreas that was 
      nearly identical to that of the control group. According to the current research, 
      biosynthesized AgNPs have strong antioxidant and antidiabetic potential and may 
      eventually provide a less expensive option for the treatment of diabetes.

TI  - Comparing outcomes of balloon-expandable vs. self-expandable valves in 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 4060-4074
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000001743 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common heart condition categorized into 
      congenital and acquired forms. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is 
      an innovative method for AS management, and two valve types, self-expanding 
      valves (SEV) and balloon-expandable valves (BEV), are used in TAVR. The objective 
      of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes associated with 
      balloon-expandable and self-expandable valves in transcatheter aortic valve 
      replacement. METHODS: The researchers conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis 
      following PRISMA guidelines and AMSTAR-2 tool. The methodology involved a 
      systematic literature search, strict eligibility criteria, unbiased study 
      selection, meticulous data extraction, quality assessment, and rigorous 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our analysis included twenty-six papers and 26 553 
      patients. BEV exhibited significant advantages over SEV in overall mortality 
      across 21 studies, particularly in perioperative and 30-day assessments. However, 
      no substantial disparities emerged between the two valve types in stroke 
      incidence. BEV demonstrated notable benefits in reducing hospitalization rates 
      across 6 studies and significantly fewer instances of permanent pacemaker 
      implantations across 19 studies, particularly evident in the perioperative 
      setting. Other secondary outcomes like bleeding, acute kidney injury, and 
      myocardial infarction showcased non-significant differences between BEV and SEV. 
      CONCLUSION: The analysis indicates that BEV may offer benefits in specific 
      aspects of TAVR outcomes, but further research is needed to fully understand the 
      factors influencing patient outcomes and mortality in TAVR procedures.

TI  - The Effect of Physical Activity/Exercise on miRNA Expression and Function in 
      Non-Communicable Diseases-A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/ijms25136813 [doi]
LID - 6813
AB  - Exercise may differently affect the expression of key molecular markers, 
      including skeletal muscle and circulating miRNAs, involved in cellular and 
      metabolic pathways' regulation in healthy individuals and in patients suffering 
      from non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Epigenetic factors are emerging as 
      potential therapeutic biomarkers in the prognosis and treatment of NCDs and 
      important epigenetic factors, miRNAs, play a crucial role in cellular pathways. 
      This systematic review aims to underline the potential link between changes in 
      miRNA expression after different types of physical activity/exercise in some 
      populations affected by NCDs. In June 2023, we systematically investigated the 
      following databases: PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science, on the basis of 
      our previously established research questions and following the PRISMA 
      guidelines. The risk of bias and quality assessment were, respectively, covered 
      by ROB2 and the Newcastle Ottawa scale. Of the 1047 records extracted from the 
      initial search, only 29 studies were found to be eligible. In these studies, the 
      authors discuss the association between exercise-modulated miRNAs and NCDs. The 
      NCDs included in the review are cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We 
      evidenced that miR-146, miR-181, miR-133, miR-21, and miRNA-1 are the most 
      reported miRNAs that are modulated by exercise. Their expression is associated 
      with an improvement in health markers and they may be a potential target in terms 
      of the development of future therapeutic tools.

AB  - Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) formed via catalytic actions of sphingosine kinase 
      1 (SphK1) behaves as a pro-survival substance and activates downstream target 
      molecules associated with various pathologies, including initiation, 
      inflammation, and progression of cancer. Here, we aimed to investigate the SphK1 
      inhibitory potentials of thymoquinone (TQ), Artemisinin (AR), and Thymol (TM) for 
      the therapeutic management of lung cancer. We implemented docking, molecular 
      dynamics (MD) simulations, enzyme inhibition assay, and fluorescence measurement 
      studies to estimate binding affinity and SphK1 inhibitory potential of TQ, AR, 
      and TM. We further investigated the anti-cancer potential of these compounds on 
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (H1299 and A549), followed by 
      estimation of mitochondrial ROS, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, 
      and cleavage of DNA by comet assay. Enzyme activity and fluorescence binding 
      studies suggest that TQ, AR, and TM significantly inhibit the activity of SphK1 
      with IC(50) values of 35.52 microM, 42.81 microM, and 53.68 microM, respectively, and have an 
      excellent binding affinity. TQ shows cytotoxic effect and anti-proliferative 
      potentials on H1299 and A549 with an IC(50) value of 27.96 microM and 54.43 microM, 
      respectively. Detection of mitochondrial ROS and mitochondrial membrane potential 
      depolarization shows promising TQ-induced oxidative stress on H1299 and A549 cell 
      lines. Comet assay shows promising TQ-induced oxidative DNA damage. In 
      conclusion, TQ, AR, and TM act as potential inhibitors for SphK1, with a strong 
      binding affinity. In addition, the cytotoxicity of TQ is linked to oxidative 
      stress due to mitochondrial ROS generation. Overall, our study suggests that TQ 
      is a promising inhibitor of SphK1 targeting lung cancer therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease (HD) is an extremely harmful autosomal inherited 
      neurodegenerative disease. Motor dysfunction, mental disorder, and cognitive 
      deficits are the characteristic features of this disease. The current study 
      examined whether 6-shogaol has a protective effect against 3-Nitropropionic Acid 
      (3-NPA)-induced HD in rats. METHODS: A total of thirty male Wistar rats received 
      6-shogaol (10 and 20 mg/kg, per oral) an hour before injection of 3-NPA (10 mg/kg 
      i.p.) for 15 days. Behavioral tests were performed, including narrow beam walk, 
      rotarod test, and grip strength test. Biochemical tests promoting oxidative 
      stress were evaluated [superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), 
      catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA)], including changes to neurotransmitters 
      serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), homovanillic acid (HVA), 
      (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and 
      5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA), nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB), tumor 
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukins-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 
      (Nrf2). The 6-shogaol was docked to the active site of TNF-alpha (2AZ5), NF-kappaB 
      (1SVC), BDNF) [1B8M], and Nrf2 [5FZN] proteins using AutoDock tools. RESULTS: The 
      6-shogaol group significantly improved behavioral activity over the 
      3-NPA-injected control rats. Moreover, 3-NPA-induced significantly altered 
      neurotransmitters, biochemical and neuroinflammatory indices, which could 
      efficiently be reversed by 6-shogaol. The 6-shogaol showed favorable negative 
      binding energies at -9.271 (BDNF) kcal/mol. CONCLUSIONS: The present 
      investigation demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of 6-shogaol in an 
      experimental animal paradigm against 3-NPA-induced HD in rats. The suggested 
      mechanism is supported by immunohistochemical analysis and western blots, 
      although more research is necessary for definite confirmation.

TI  - Elucidating bis-pyrimidines as new and efficient mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors: 
      synthesis, SAR, kinetics and computational studies.
PG  - 22769-22780
LID - 10.1039/d4ra04652h [doi]
AB  - In this study, a series of novel bis-pyrimidine derivatives (1P-8P) were 
      designed, synthesized, characterized, and investigated for their in vitro 
      inhibitory activity against mushroom tyrosinase, an enzyme critical in melanin 
      biosynthesis and implicated in various hyperpigmentation disorders. To the best 
      of our knowledge, the bispyrimidine scaffold has been evaluated for the first 
      time for its tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Their inhibitory activities were 
      assessed, revealing inhibition with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. 
      Additionally, this series of compounds were found to inhibit tyrosinase activity 
      in a mixed-type manner, with IC(50) values ranging from 12.36 +/- 1.24 to 86.67 +/- 
      3.08 muM. To further elucidate the binding interactions, molecular docking 
      simulations were performed, identifying key residues in the active site 
      responsible for binding affinity. Furthermore, molecular dynamics (MD) 
      simulations were conducted to assess the dynamic behavior, stability, and binding 
      affinity of the most potent inhibitor, compound 6P. Quantitative 
      Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models were developed to correlate the 
      structural features of the bis-pyrimidines with their inhibitory activity, 
      providing insights into the structure-activity relationships (SAR) that govern 
      their potency. The experimental and theoretical findings demonstrated excellent 
      agreement. These findings pave the way for the development of novel 
      bis-pyrimidine-based therapeutic agents for treating hyperpigmentation and 
      related conditions.

AB  - The present research is centered on analyzing and modeling the scattering 
      characteristics of a trifurcated waveguide that includes impedance 
      discontinuities. A mode-matching method, grounded in projecting the solution onto 
      orthogonal basis functions, is devised for the investigation. The impedance 
      disparities at the interfaces are represented in normal velocity modes, which, 
      when combined with pressure modes, result in a linear algebraic system. This 
      system is subsequently truncated and inverted for numerical experimentation. The 
      convergence of scattering amplitudes is assured by reconstructing matching 
      conditions and adhering to conservation laws. The computational results indicate 
      that optimizing attenuation behavior is achievable through manipulating variation 
      bounding properties and impedance discontinuities.

AB  - In this study, we present in vitro actions of pure commercial preparations of 
      oxidized and/or dehydrated metabolites of cholesterol (OS) identified in the 
      lipid fraction of Fraction B (FB) prepared from a catfish skin preparation on 
      calcium transients and on the formation of human neutrophil extracellular traps 
      (NETs). These investigations are part of an ongoing effort to understand the 
      important roles these compounds play as components of FB when FB is applied to 
      accelerate the healing of wounds and the healing of highly infected non-healing 
      diabetic foot ulcers, without the use of antibiotics. Our aim was to determine 
      potential therapeutic interventions for various disease states. Our results 
      reveal interesting findings, demonstrating specific actions of the individual 
      compounds. Compounds 7alpha-hydroxy-cholesterol (S3), Cholestane-3,5,6-triol (S5), 
      5-cholesten-3beta-ol-7-one (S8) and Cholesta-3,5 dien-7-one (S10) are inhibitory, 
      while Cholesterol 5beta,6beta-epoxide (S4) and 5alpha-cholestane-3,6-dione (S11) activate 
      the response for calcium influx in human neutrophils. A somewhat similar response 
      is observed in dHL60 cell lines, where S3, S5, S7, S8, and cholesta-2,4-diene 
      (S14) inhibit the calcium influx, although S4, S10, and S11 activate the response 
      in this cell line. Furthermore, we observed a relationship between actions 
      against NETosis and calcium transients. Interestingly, relative to the vehicle 
      control, S3, Cholesta-3,5 diene (S9), and S14 appeared to significantly stimulate 
      DNA release (NETosis), while S2, 7alpha-hydroxy-cholesterol (S6) and cholesta-3,5 
      dien-7-one (S10) caused lesser stimulation. We provide the IC50 activities for 
      each compound tested in each assay. Calcium influx and NETs formation (NETosis) 
      correlate with diseases exacerbation. These findings offer valuable insights into 
      the potential therapeutic applications of individual OS for various diseases, 
      highlighting their importance in future interventions.

      Informatics Supporting Evidence-Based Medicine.

AB  - Evidence-based medicine (EBM) emerged from McMaster University in the 1980-1990s, 
      which emphasizes the integration of the best research evidence with clinical 
      expertise and patient values. The Health Information Research Unit (HiRU) was 
      created at McMaster University in 1985 to support EBM. Early on, digital health 
      informatics took the form of teaching clinicians how to search MEDLINE with 
      modems and phone lines. Searching and retrieval of published articles were 
      transformed as electronic platforms provided greater access to clinically 
      relevant studies, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines, with 
      PubMed playing a pivotal role. In the early 2000s, the HiRU introduced Clinical 
      Queries-validated search filters derived from the curated, gold-standard, 
      human-appraised Hedges dataset-to enhance the precision of searches, allowing 
      clinicians to hone their queries based on study design, population, and outcomes. 
      Currently, almost 1 million articles are added to PubMed annually. To filter 
      through this volume of heterogenous publications for clinically important 
      articles, the HiRU team and other researchers have been applying classical 
      machine learning, deep learning, and, increasingly, large language models (LLMs). 
      These approaches are built upon the foundation of gold-standard annotated 
      datasets and humans in the loop for active machine learning. In this viewpoint, 
      we explore the evolution of health informatics in supporting evidence search and 
      retrieval processes over the past 25+ years within the HiRU, including the 
      evolving roles of LLMs and responsible artificial intelligence, as we continue to 
      facilitate the dissemination of knowledge, enabling clinicians to integrate the

AB  - Parkinson's disease is one of the vital neurodegenerative ailments attributed to 
      a rise in Alpha-synuclein proteins leading to the advancement of motor and 
      cognitive deterioration. Interestingly, in PD lncRNAs, miRNAs and siRNAs are also 
      key regulators of SNCA and alpha-synuclein aggregation. This review will focus on 
      the roles of these three types of small RNAs in trebling the development of PD 
      through regulating SNCA expression or alpha-synuclein protein mediating the RNA 
      from acting. Parkinson's disease is de fi ned by the build-up of alpha-synuclein 
      protein resulting predominantly from the elevated expression level of the SNCA 
      gene. Non-coding RNAs have gained broad appeal as fundamental modulators of gene 
      expression and protein aggregation dynamics, with significant implications on the 
      aetiology of PD. LncRNAs modulate SNCA transcription and edit epigenetic 
      modifications, while miRNA target mRNA is involved in the stability and 
      translation of count alpha-synuclein. Considering all these data, siRNAs can 
      achieve the precise gene silencing effect that directly induces the 
      downregulation of SNCA mRNA. This review also summarizes some recent reports 
      about the interaction between these ncRNAs with the SNCA gene and alpha-synuclein 
      protein, each through its independent in addition to synergistic mechanisms. This 
      review highlights the possibility of therapeutic interventions to perturb SNCA 
      expression to prevent alpha-synuclein aggregation via targeting ncRNAs that might 
      be spun off novel drug development for PD.

AB  - Pyroptosis is an inflammatory programed cell death process that plays a crucial 
      role in cancer therapeutic, while Gasdermin-D is a critical effector protein for 
      pyroptosis execution. This review discusses the intricate interactions between 
      Gasdermin-D and some non-coding RNAs (lncRNA, miRNA, siRNA) and their potential 
      application in the regulation of pyroptosis as an anticancer therapy. 
      Correspondingly, these ncRNAs significantly implicate in Gasdermin-D expression 
      and function regarding the pyroptosis pathway. Functioning as competing 
      endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), these ncRNAs might regulate Gasdermin-D at the 
      molecular level, underlying fatal cell death caused by cancer and tumor 
      propagation. Therefore, these interactions appeal to therapeutics, offering new 
      avenues for cancer treatment. It address this research gap by discussing the 
      possible roles of ncRNAs as mediators of gasdermin-D regulation. It suggest 
      therapeutic strategies based on the current research findings to ensure the 
      interchange between the ideal pyroptosis and cancer cell death.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is a heterogenous disease and 
      current classification is based on observational responses to therapies or kidney 
      histology. The National Unified Renal Translational Research Enterprise 
      (NURTuRE)-INS cohort aims to facilitate novel ways of stratifying INS patients to 
      improve disease understanding, therapeutics and design of clinical trials. 
      METHODS: NURTuRE-INS is a prospective cohort study of children and adults with 
      INS in a linked biorepository. All recruits had at least one sampling visit 
      collecting serum, plasma, urine and blood for RNA and DNA extraction, frozen 
      within 2 hours of collection. Clinical histology slides and biopsy tissue blocks 
      were also collected. RESULTS: A total of 739 participants were recruited from 23 
      centres to NURTuRE-INS, half of whom were diagnosed in childhood [n = 365 (49%)]. 
      The majority were white [n = 525 (71%)] and the median age at recruitment was 
      32 years (interquartile range 12-54). Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) 
      was the most common clinical diagnosis [n = 518 (70%)]. Of patients diagnosed in 
      childhood who underwent a kidney biopsy, for SSNS (n =103), 76 demonstrated 
      minimal change disease (MCD), whereas for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome 
      (n =80), 21 had MCD. Almost all patients diagnosed in adulthood had a kidney 
      biopsy [n = 352 (94%)]; 187 had MCD and 162 had focal segmental 
      glomerulosclerosis. CONCLUSIONS: NURTuRE-INS is a prospective cohort study with 
      high-quality biosamples and longitudinal data that will assist research into the 
      mechanistic stratification of INS. Samples and data will be available through a 
      Strategic Access and Oversight Committee.

AB  - Cancer is a generic term for a group of disorders defined by uncontrolled cell 
      growth and the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Gene and 
      epigenetic alterations disrupt normal cellular control, leading to abnormal cell 
      proliferation, resistance to cell death, blood vessel development, and metastasis 
      (spread to other organs). One of the several routes that play an important role 
      in the development and progression of cancer is the phosphoinositide 3-kinase 
      (PI3K) signaling pathway. Moreover, the gene PIK3CG encodes the catalytic subunit 
      gamma (p110gamma) of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3Kgamma), a member of the PI3K family. 
      Therefore, in this study, PIK3CG was targeted to inhibit cancer by identifying a 
      novel inhibitor through computational methods. The study screened 1015 chemical 
      fragments against PIK3CG using machine learning-based binding estimation and 
      docking to select the potential compounds. Later, the analogues were generated 
      from the selected hits, and 414 analogues were selected, which were further 
      screened, and as most potential candidates, three compounds were obtained: (a) 
      84,332, 190,213, and 885,387. The protein-ligand complex's stability and 
      flexibility were then investigated by dynamic modeling. The 100 ns simulation 
      revealed that 885,387 exhibited the steadiest deviation and constant creation of 
      hydrogen bonds. Compared to the other compounds, 885,387 demonstrated a superior 
      binding free energy (DeltaG = -18.80 kcal/mol) with the protein when the MM/GBSA 
      technique was used. The study determined that 885,387 showed significant 
      therapeutic potential and justifies further experimental investigation as a 
      possible inhibitor of the PIK3CG target implicated in cancer.

TI  - Association Between Tea Drinking and Anemia in Women of Reproductive Age: A 
      Cross-Sectional Study From the Mekran Division, Balochistan, Pakistan.
PG  - e64801
LID - 10.7759/cureus.64801 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia in females of the reproductive age group is an area of concern 
      globally, but its prevalence is high in developing countries. Dietary habits and 
      lifestyle impact the hematological parameters. It is important to evaluate the 
      impact of tea drinking on hematological parameters in females of the reproductive 
      age group. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to determine the association of tea drinking 
      with anemia among women of reproductive age (WRA) in the Mekran division of 
      Balochistan. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted at 
      Mekran Medical College (MMC), a teaching hospital in Turbat, Balochistan, by the 
      Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology from December 2023 to May 2024. Using a 
      non-probability convenience sampling technique, a total of 356 females, 16-35 
      years of age, were included in the study after getting informed consent. Pregnant 
      females and those who were using any medication for anemia were excluded from the 
      study. Blood samples were analyzed using a CBC hematology analyzer. Data were 
      analyzed using SPSS 26 by applying an independent sample t-test and chi-square 
      test. RESULTS: Among all 356 included participants, 193 females were anemic. 
      Among the tea drinkers (n = 266), 159 participants were mild to severely anemic. 
      While among non-tea-drinking women (n = 90), only 34 participants were mild or 
      moderately anemic with no severe anemia. A significant association was found 
      between tea drinking and anemia among WRA (p < 0.05). A significant mean 
      difference was found in the hemoglobin (Hb), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and 
      mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) levels among the tea-drinker and 
      non-tea-drinker participants (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The WRA group from the 
      Mekran region is suffering from anemia. Women who drink tea suffer more from 
      anemia. Effective healthcare strategies should be implemented to address the 
      issue of anemia among WRA.

TI  - The Anticancer Journey of Liquiritin: Insights into Its Mechanisms and 
      Therapeutic Prospects.
LID - 10.2174/0109298673315699240805111122 [doi]
AB  - Liquiritin (LIQ), a bioactive flavonoid from Glycyrrhiza species, has shown 
      significant potential in cancer therapy. LIQ exhibits potent inhibitory effects 
      on various cancer cell types, including breast, lung, liver, and colon cancers, 
      while demonstrating low toxicity towards healthy cells. Its anticancer mechanisms 
      include inducing cell cycle arrest, promoting apoptosis, and modulating 
      inflammation-related pathways. Additionally, LIQ impedes angiogenesis and 
      enhances the efficacy of conventional chemotherapies through sensitization and 
      synergistic effects with other natural compounds and targeted therapies. These 
      multifaceted actions highlight LIQ as a promising candidate for further 
      development as an anticancer agent. This abstract provides an overview of LIQ's 
      chemistry, biological effects, and underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Migration, a bird's metabolic apex, depends primarily on the liver and muscle for 
      fuel mobilization and endurance flight. In migratory redheaded buntings, adaptive 
      increase in mitochondrial membrane (MM) proton gradient to drive ATP synthesis, 
      measured by MM potential (MMP+) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) response, have 
      been well characterized in the blood but not in the muscle or liver. We assessed 
      MMP+, ROS, and apoptosis in the liver and pectoralis muscle of photosensitive 
      nonmigratory (nMig.) male redheaded buntings photoinduced to migratory (Mig.) 
      states. Relative expression levels of genes associated with energy (ACADM, PEPCK, 
      GOT2, GLUT1, and CS), ROS modulation (SIRT1), mitochondrial free-radical 
      scavengers (SOD1, PRX4, NOS2, GPX1, and GPX4), anti-apoptotic genes (NF-kappabeta), 
      apoptotic (CASP7), and tissue damage using histology, during migration were 
      assessed. The MMP+ decreased and the ROS concentration increased, due to the 
      metabolic load on liver and pectoralis muscle tissues during Mig. However, 
      percentage of apoptotic cells increased in liver but decreased in muscle, which 
      is of functional significance to migratory passerines. During Mig., in muscle, 
      SIRT1 increased, while an increase in anti-apoptotic NF-kappabeta aided immune 
      pathway-mediated antioxidant activity and guarded against muscle oxidative damage 
      during migration. Inter-organ differences in metabolism add to our current 
      understanding of metabolic flexibility that supports successful migration in 
      buntings.

AB  - Herbs have been used as medicines since antiquity, and it has been discovered 
      that the human body responds well to herbal remedies. Research on the effect of 
      butin was conducted in the current study in the alloxan-induced diabetic rat 
      paradigm. A total of 30 Wistar rats were randomly assigned into the following 
      groups (n = 6): I-Normal; II-Alloxan-induced (50 mg/kg); III-Alloxan + butin 
      25 mg/kg; IV-Alloxan + butin 50 mg/kg; V-Butin per se 50 mg/kg. Various diabetic 
      parameters (blood glucose, insulin, HbA1c), lipid profile, inflammatory (TNF-alpha, 
      IL-1beta, IL-6 and NF-kappaB), antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD and GSH), oxidative stress 
      indicators (MDA), apoptosis marker (caspase-3), hepatic markers (ALT and AST), 
      and histopathological changes were assessed. Additionally, molecular docking and 
      dynamics were performed to evaluate the interaction of butin with target 
      proteins. Butin treatment, at both doses, significantly restored biochemical 
      parameters and preserved pancreatic histopathology in diabetic rats. It 
      effectively modulated blood parameters, lipid profiles, inflammatory markers, 
      apoptosis, antioxidant enzyme activity, oxidative stress, and hepatic markers. 
      Molecular docking revealed that butin binds to proteins such as caspase-3 (1NME), 
      NF-kappaB (1SVC), and serum insulin (4IBM) with binding affinities of - 7.4, - 6.5, 
      and - 8.2 kcal/mol, respectively. Molecular dynamics simulations further 
      suggested that butin induces significant conformational changes in these 
      proteins. Butin exhibits potential effects against alloxan-induced diabetic rats 
      by restoring biochemical balance, reducing inflammation, and protecting 
      pancreatic tissue. Its binding to key proteins involved in apoptosis and 
      inflammation highlights its therapeutic potential in diabetes management.

TI  - The effect of intrathecal pethidine on post-spinal anesthesia shivering after 
      cesarean section: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 5461-5470
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000002354 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal anesthesia is the most preferred method for cesarean section 
      (C-section). This meta-analysis was performed to determine the effect of low and 
      high intrathecal doses of pethidine on the maternal outcomes after C-section. 
      METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google 
      Scholar was performed. Random-effects meta-analysis was performed to derive odds 
      ratios (ORs) from dichotomous data. RESULTS: Seventeen randomized controlled 
      trials with 1304 C-section patients were included. Patients who had received 
      intrathecal pethidine experienced decreased shivering and intensity of shivering 
      (OR 0.13; P<0.001) and (OR 0.21; P<0.001), respectively. Moreover, vomiting (OR 
      2.47; P=0.002) and pruritus (OR 5.92; P<0.001) were significantly higher in the 
      pethidine group. There was no statistically significant difference in the 
      incidence of nausea (OR 2.55; P=0.06) and hypotension (OR 0.91; P=0.67). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Intrathecal pethidine can effectively decrease shivering, although 
      it increases the risk of vomiting and pruritus. No significant difference was 
      found both in the maternal hypotension and nausea.

PG  - e37825
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000037825 [doi]
LID - e37825
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbial metabolites such as trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and 
      its precursors, namely betaine, L-carnitine, and choline, have been implicated as 
      risk factors for cardiovascular events and mortality development. Therefore, we 
      aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the validity of 
      these associations. METHODS: MEDLINE and Scopus were queried from their inception 
      to August 2023 to identify studies that quantified estimates of the associations 
      of TMAO with the development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or 
      death. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to pool unadjusted or 
      multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and their 95% confidence intervals. The 
      primary endpoint was the risk of MACE and all-cause death. RESULTS: 30 
      prospective observational studies (n = 48 968) were included in the analysis. 
      Elevated TMAO levels were associated with a significantly greater risk of MACE 
      and all-cause death compared to low TMAO levels (HR: 1.41, 95% CI 1.2-1.54, 
      P < .00001, I2 = 43%) and (HR: 1.55, 95% CI 1.37-1.75, P < .00001, I2 = 46%), 
      respectively. Furthermore, high levels of either L-carnitine or choline were 
      found to significantly increase the risk of MACE. However, no significant 
      difference was seen in MACE in either high or low levels of betaine. CONCLUSION: 
      Elevated concentrations of TMAO were associated with increased risks of MACE and 
      all-cause mortality. High levels of L-carnitine/choline were also significantly 
      associated with an increased risk of MACE. However, no significant difference was 
      found between high or low levels of betaine for the outcome of MACE.

AB  - Mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment are widespread phenomena among 
      the elderly, being crucial factors that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. 
      Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of 
      cellular defense systems, including that against oxidative stress. As such, 
      increased Nrf2 activity may serve as a strategy to avert mitochondrial 
      dysfunction and cognitive decline. Scientific data on Nrf2-mediated 
      neuroprotection was collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, 
      specifically addressing mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in 
      older people. Search terms included "Nrf2", "mitochondrial dysfunction," 
      "cognitive impairment," and "neuroprotection." Studies focusing on in vitro and 
      in vivo models and clinical investigations were included to review Nrf2's 
      therapeutic potential comprehensively. The relative studies have demonstrated 
      that increased Nrf2 activity could improve mitochondrial performance, decrease 
      oxidative pressure, and mitigate cognitive impairment. To a large extent, this is 
      achieved through the modulation of critical cellular signalling pathways such as 
      the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, mitochondrial biogenesis, and neuroinflammatory 
      responses. The present review summarizes the recent progress in comprehending the 
      molecular mechanisms regarding the neuroprotective benefits mediated by Nrf2 
      through its substantial role against mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive 
      impairment. This review also emphasizes Nrf2-target pathways and their 
      contribution to cognitive function improvement and rescue from 
      mitochondria-related abnormalities as treatment strategies for neurodegenerative 
      diseases that often affect elderly individuals.

AB  - Introduction Prolonged stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) are known to 
      increase the risk of adverse outcomes following severe conditions. This study 
      focuses on the factors affecting ICU length of stay, particularly in Urology and 
      Nephrology patients who require intensive monitoring and specialized care, and 
      their impact on patient outcomes. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was 
      conducted with a sample size of 45 patients. Data was collected using a validated 
      closed-ended questionnaire and analyzed with IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
      Version 23.0 (Released 2015; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Results 
      The study found positive associations between prolonged ICU stay and several 
      factors, including elevated total bilirubin levels, deranged creatinine, urea, 
      sodium, and calcium levels, as well as abnormal C-reactive protein levels. Higher 
      bilirubin levels and positive blood and culture results were linked to extended 
      ICU stays. Additionally, the use of contrast CT and MRI was associated with 
      longer ICU durations. Conversely, broad-spectrum antibiotics showed a negative 
      association with ICU stay length, while transfusion of blood products was 
      positively associated with longer stays. Conclusion Understanding these factors 
      can help improve the management of ICU patients and enhance outcomes in future 
      cases.

AB  - Given the suboptimal performance of Boolean searching to identify 
      methodologically sound and clinically relevant studies in large bibliographic 
      databases, exploring machine learning (ML) to efficiently classify studies is 
      warranted. To boost the efficiency of a literature surveillance program, we used 
      a large internationally recognized dataset of articles tagged for methodological 
      rigor and applied an automated ML approach to train and test binary 
      classification models to predict the probability of clinical research articles 
      being of high methodologic quality. We trained over 12,000 models on a dataset of 
      titles and abstracts of 97,805 articles indexed in PubMed from 2012-2018 which 
      were manually appraised for rigor by highly trained research associates and rated 
      for clinical relevancy by practicing clinicians. As the dataset is unbalanced, 
      with more articles that do not meet the criteria for rigor, we used the 
      unbalanced dataset and over- and under-sampled datasets. Models that maintained 
      sensitivity for high rigor at 99% and maximized specificity were selected and 
      tested in a retrospective set of 30,424 articles from 2020 and validated 
      prospectively in a blinded study of 5253 articles. The final selected algorithm, 
      combining a LightGBM (gradient boosting machine) model trained in each dataset, 
      maintained high sensitivity and achieved 57% specificity in the retrospective 
      validation test and 53% in the prospective study. The number of articles needed 
      to read to find one that met appraisal criteria was 3.68 (95% CI 3.52 to 3.85) in 
      the prospective study, compared with 4.63 (95% CI 4.50 to 4.77) when relying only 
      on Boolean searching. Gradient-boosting ML models reduced the work required to 
      classify high quality clinical research studies by 45%, improving the efficiency 
      of literature surveillance and subsequent dissemination to clinicians and other 
      evidence users.

TI  - lncRNAs as prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in cuproptosis-mediated 
      cancer.
PG  - 226

LID - 226
AB  - Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial regulators in various 
      cellular processes, including cancer progression and stress response. Recent 
      studies have demonstrated that copper accumulation induces a unique form of cell 
      death known as cuproptosis, with lncRNAs playing a key role in regulating 
      cuproptosis-associated pathways. These lncRNAs may trigger cell-specific 
      responses to copper stress, presenting new opportunities as prognostic markers 
      and therapeutic targets. This paper delves into the role of lncRNAs in 
      cuproptosis-mediated cancer, underscoring their potential as biomarkers and 
      targets for innovative therapeutic strategies. A thorough review of scientific 
      literature was conducted, utilizing databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar, and 
      ScienceDirect, with search terms like 'lncRNAs,' 'cuproptosis,' and 'cancer.' 
      Studies were selected based on their relevance to lncRNA regulation of 
      cuproptosis pathways and their implications for cancer prognosis and treatment. 
      The review highlights the significant contribution of lncRNAs in regulating 
      cuproptosis-related genes and pathways, impacting copper metabolism, 
      mitochondrial stress responses, and apoptotic signaling. Specific lncRNAs are 
      potential prognostic markers in breast, lung, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, and 
      gastric cancers. The objective of this article is to explore the role of lncRNAs 
      as potential prognostic markers and therapeutic targets in cancers mediated by 
      cuproptosis.

AB  - With the advent rise is in urbanization and industrialization, heavy metals (HMs) 
      such as lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) contamination have increased considerably. It 
      is among the most recalcitrant pollutants majorly affecting the biotic and 
      abiotic components of the ecosystem like human well-being, animals, soil health, 
      crop productivity, and diversity of prokaryotes (bacteria) and eukaryotes 
      (plants, fungi, and algae). At higher concentrations, these metals are toxic for 
      their growth and pose a significant environmental threat, necessitating 
      innovative and sustainable remediation strategies. Bacteria exhibit diverse 
      mechanisms to cope with HM exposure, including biosorption, chelation, and efflux 
      mechanism, while fungi contribute through mycorrhizal associations and hyphal 
      networks. Algae, especially microalgae, demonstrate effective biosorption and 
      bioaccumulation capacities. Plants, as phytoremediators, hyperaccumulate metals, 
      providing a nature-based approach for soil reclamation. Integration of these 
      biological agents in combination presents opportunities for enhanced remediation 
      efficiency. This comprehensive review aims to provide insights into joint action 
      of prokaryotic and eukaryotic interactions in the management of HM stress in the 
      environment.

AB  - Lung cancer remains an intractable malignancy worldwide, prompting novel 
      therapeutic modalities. Pyroptosis, a lethal form of programmed cell death 
      featured by inflammation, has been involved in cancer progression and treatment 
      response. Simultaneously, non-coding RNA has been shown to have important roles 
      in coordinating pattern formation and oncogenic pathways, including long 
      non-coding RNA (lncRNAs), microRNA (miRNAs), circular RNA (circRNAs), and small 
      interfering RNA (siRNAs). Recent studies have revealed that ncRNAs can promote or 
      inhibit pyroptosis by interacting with key molecular players such as NLRP3, 
      GSDMD, and various transcription factors. This dual role of ncRNAs offers a 
      unique therapeutic potential to manipulate pyroptosis pathways, providing 
      opportunities for innovative cancer treatments. In this review, we integrate 
      current research findings to propose novel strategies for leveraging 
      ncRNA-mediated pyroptosis as a therapeutic intervention in lung cancer. We 
      explore the potential of ncRNAs as biomarkers for predicting patient response to 
      treatment and as targets for overcoming resistance to conventional therapies.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of global mortality, 
      underscoring the critical need for accurate and timely diagnosis. This narrative 
      review examines the current applications and future potential of artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cardiovascular imaging. We discuss 
      the integration of these technologies across various imaging modalities, 
      including echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 
      nuclear imaging techniques. The review explores AI-assisted diagnosis in key 
      areas such as coronary artery disease detection, valve disorders assessment, 
      cardiomyopathy classification, arrhythmia detection, and prediction of 
      cardiovascular events. AI demonstrates promise in improving diagnostic accuracy, 
      efficiency, and personalized care. However, significant challenges persist, 
      including data quality standardization, model interpretability, regulatory 
      considerations, and clinical workflow integration. We also address the 
      limitations of current AI applications and the ethical implications of their 
      implementation in clinical practice. Future directions point towards advanced AI 
      architectures, multimodal imaging integration, and applications in precision 
      medicine and population health management. The review emphasizes the need for 
      ongoing collaboration between clinicians, data scientists, and policymakers to 
      realize the full potential of AI in cardiovascular imaging while ensuring ethical 
      and equitable implementation. As the field continues to evolve, addressing these 
      challenges will be crucial for the successful integration of AI technologies into 
      cardiovascular care, potentially revolutionizing diagnostic capabilities and 
      improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Mitral valve repair and replacement in infectious endocarditis: a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of clinical outcome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) poses significant clinical challenges, 
      often necessitating surgical intervention for improved patient outcomes. The 
      choice between mitral valve repair (MVP) and mitral valve replacement (MVR) is 
      crucial in managing IE. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare 
      the effectiveness of MVP and MVR in treating IE, focusing on outcomes such as 
      postoperative bleeding, mortality, recurrent endocarditis, and stroke. MAIN TEXT: 
      A comprehensive literature search was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. 
      Studies directly comparing MVP and MVR in IE patients were included. Data 
      extraction and quality assessment were performed, and meta-analysis was conducted 
      using RevMan software. Thirty-two studies involving 82,123 patients were 
      included. MVP was associated with significantly lower rates of postoperative 
      bleeding (OR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.40-0.84) and reduced long-term mortality (OR: 0.40, 
      95% CI: 0.32-0.51) compared to MVR. However, MVR showed lower rates of recurrent 
      endocarditis. MVP was also associated with a decreased likelihood of 
      postoperative stroke (OR: 0.52, 95% CI: 0.40-0.68).2, 4 CONCLUSIONS: MVP 
      demonstrates advantages over MVR in reducing postoperative bleeding, long-term 
      mortality, and stroke risk in IE patients. However, individual patient factors 
      and surgical expertise must be considered in treatment decisions. Further 
      research, including randomized controlled trials, is needed to validate these 
      findings and refine treatment algorithms for IE management.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Intravenous Diltiazem Versus Metoprolol in the Management 
      of Atrial Fibrillation with Rapid Ventricular Response in the Emergency 
      Department: A Comprehensive Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and 
      Meta-analyses.
PG  - 6022-6036
LID - 10.19102/icrm.2024.15095 [doi]
AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in the United 
      States, affecting 2.7-6.1 million people. AF can cause symptoms, but when it 
      triggers a rapid ventricular response (RVR), most patients suffer from 
      decompensation. Therefore, we performed an umbrella review of systematic reviews 
      and meta-analyses comparing intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem to identify 
      discrepancies, fill in knowledge gaps, and develop standardized decision-making 
      guidelines for physicians to manage AF with RVR. A comprehensive search was 
      conducted in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Scopus to identify studies for 
      this umbrella review. The overall certainty of the evidence was assessed using 
      the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation method, 
      while the quality of the included reviews was evaluated using AMSTAR 2, the 
      Cochrane Collaboration tool, and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. This study 
      comprehensively analyzed four meta-analyses covering 11 randomized controlled 
      trials and 19 observational studies. The analysis showed that IV diltiazem 
      treatment was significantly more successful in rate control for AF with rapid 
      ventricular response (RVR) than IV metoprolol (risk ratio [RR], 1.30; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.56; I (2) = 0%; P = .003). IV diltiazem also led 
      to a significantly greater reduction in ventricular rate (mean difference, 
      -14.55; 95% CI, -16.93 to -12.16; I (2) = 72%; P < .00001), particularly at 10 
      min. The analysis also revealed a significantly increased risk of hypotension 
      associated with treatment with IV diltiazem (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.14-1.79; I (2) = 
      0%; P = .002). In conclusion, IV diltiazem therapy achieved better rate control 
      and ventricular rate decrease than metoprolol therapy in AF with RVR. Future 
      clinical trials should compare calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers for heart 
      rate control efficacy and safety, considering adverse events.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Exercise in Reducing Cardiovascular Risk Factors Among 
      Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
PG  - e68928
LID - 10.7759/cureus.68928 [doi]

AB  - Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the major causes of sickness and 
      death in the world. However, lifestyle modifications, such as exercise, can 
      significantly reduce the risk of this disease. This study aimed to assess the 
      effectiveness of various forms of physical activity in reducing CVD risk factors 
      among adults. A comprehensive search of the databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to 
      Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE) databases was 
      conducted between January 1, 2014, and May 31, 2024, as per Preferred Reporting 
      Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, and observational studies on the impact 
      of aerobic, resistance, or combined training on cardiovascular risk factors in 
      adults (>/=18 years) were considered for inclusion. Data relating to primary 
      outcomes, including stroke and myocardial infarction rates, BP, cholesterol 
      levels, and BMI were collected. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the 
      Methodological Index for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) checklist were used for 
      quality and bias assessment. Meta-analyses were performed using the RevMan 
      software, with heterogeneity evaluated by I(2) statistics; 17 studies, including 11 
      RCTs and six cohort studies, met the inclusion criteria. There was a significant 
      reduction in the mean systolic BP (SBP) by 3.32 mmHg [95% confidence interval 
      (CI): 0.85-5.78 mmHg; p<0.0001] and mean diastolic BP (DBP) by 2.99 mmHg (95% CI: 
      2.34-3.64 mmHg; p < 0.00001) after exercise interventions. Moreover, cholesterol 
      levels and BMI values improved with exercise. Those who exercised had a lower 
      risk of stroke or heart attack compared with the controls [odds ratio (OR): 0.57; 
      95% CI: 0.28-1.14; p >0.0001], although there was substantial heterogeneity in 
      effect size across the studies (I(2) = 98%). Different types of physical activity 
      (i.e., aerobic, resistance, or combined exercise) can effectively reduce key 
      cardiovascular risk factors, including BP, cholesterol levels, and BMI values. 
      Regular physical activity is still regarded as the most effective preventive 
      measure against CVD, despite inconsistencies in research findings. Future studies 
      should aim to identify optimal exercise programs and their long-term effects on 
      diverse populations.

      optimizing treatment strategies. This systematic review aims to evaluate the role 
      of neuropharmacological agents based on their efficacy, involved 
      neurotransmitters, and receptors. A manual literature search was undertaken in 
      PubMed including Medline, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Plos One, Science 
      Direct, and clinicaltrials.gov from 2013 until 2023. Out of the 13 included 
      studies, seven evaluated the role of gabapentinoids. Two main drugs from this 
      group, gabapentin and pregabalin, function by binding voltage-gated calcium 
      channels, lowering neuronal hyperexcitability and pain signal transmission, 
      thereby relieving neuropathic pain. Four of the pooled studies reported the use 
      of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) including amitriptyline and nortriptyline 
      which work by blocking the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin, their 
      increased concentration is thought to be central to their analgesic effect. Three 
      articles assessed the use of serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
      and reported them as effective as the TCAs in managing neuropathic pain. They 
      work by augmenting serotonin and norepinephrine. Three studies focused on the use 
      of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), modulating their effect by 
      increasing serotonin levels; however, they were reported as not a highly 
      effective treatment option for neuropathic pain. One of the studies outlined the 
      use of cannabinoids for neuropathic pain by binding to cannabinoid receptors with 
      only mild adverse effects. It is concluded that gabapentinoids, TCAs, and SNRIs 
      were reported as the most effective therapy for neuropathic pain; however, for 
      trigeminal neuralgia, anticonvulsants like carbamazepine were considered the most 
      effective. Opioids were considered second-line drugs for neuropathic pain as they 
      come with adverse effects and a risk of dependence. Ongoing research is exploring 
      novel drugs like ion channels and agents modulating pain pathways for neuropathic 
      pain management. Our review hopes to inspire further research into patient 
      stratification by their physiology, aiding quicker and more accurate management 
      of neuropathic pain while minimizing inadvertent side effects.

AB  - This work demonstrates the facile one step hydrothermal synthesis of carbon dots 
      doped with nitrogen and sulfur (SCDs). The carbon dots have various uses, 
      including their use as molecular payloads for antioxidant and drug delivery 
      purposes. The sizes of the CDs were determined using transmission electron 
      microscopy (TEM), which revealed an average size of 4.2 nm. The successful sulfur 
      doping was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray 
      photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), which identified typical functional groups and 
      elemental composition. UV-vis and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy revealed a 
      wide absorption peak at 280 nm and a pronounced blue emission at 440 nm. 
      Colloidal stability was confirmed by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta 
      potential analysis. The antioxidant characteristics were evaluated through the 
      use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, which confirmed a 
      notable ability to scavenge radicals which revealed more than 80% radical 
      scavenging capability. The SCDs also showed nontoxic behavior against living 
      cells. The findings emphasize the potential of SCDs in the fields of bioimaging, 
      drug delivery, and as potent antioxidant agents.

AB  - One of the most complex human physiological processes to study is pregnancy. 
      Standard animal models, as well as two-dimensional models, lack the complexity 
      and biological relevance required to accurately study such a physiological 
      process. Recent studies have focused on the development of three-dimensional 
      models based on microfluidic systems, designated as placental microphysiological 
      systems (PMPSs). PMPS devices provide a model of the placental barrier through 
      culturing relevant cell types in specific arrangements and media to mimic the in 
      vivo environment of the maternal-fetal circulation. Here, recent developments of 
      PMPS models for embryo uterine implantation, preeclampsia evaluation, and 
      toxicological screening are presented. Studies that use bioprinting techniques 
      are also discussed. Lastly, recent developments in endometrium microphysiological 
      systems are reviewed. All these presented models showed their superiority 
      compared to standard models in recapitulating the biological environment seen in 
      vivo. However, several limitations regarding the types of cells and materials 
      used for these systems were also widely reported. Despite the need for further 
      improvements, PMPS models contribute to a better understanding of the biological 
      mechanisms surrounding pregnancy and the respective pathologies.

AB  - The analysis aimed to prepare an in-situ implant (ISFI) formulation holding 
      dimethyl fumarate as (a model drug) using cross-linked gellan gum by 
      homogenization method. Cross-linking of gellan gum was done with L-cysteine to 
      improve its gelation properties. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) 
      and (DSC) Differential scanning calorimetry were used to test the compatibility 
      of the drug-polymer. The diverse formulations were prepared and tested using 
      Design Expert(R) ver 8.0.1 software to optimize the experiment technique and employ 
      the response surface. The tissue compatibility of the test verified the existence 
      of non-irritants in the established formulation. All preparations contained the 
      drug content from approximately 97.98 to 99.88%. Viscosities are ideal for 
      injection in the optimized formulation (1,55 percent w/w in water). The optimized 
      formula was monitored, and up to 156hours, it was found to be 95.7%. The result 
      was that ISFI can effectively monitor and control the delivery of several 
      powerful drug products.

AB  - Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator 
      of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates 
      various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative 
      stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of 
      SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), 
      Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral 
      Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activators, 
      such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease symptoms by 
      reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting neuronal 
      survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these SIRT1 
      activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting SIRT1 in 
      neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in ageing and 
      neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms, 
      therapeutic potential, and clinical applications.

      disease.

AB  - Huntington's disease (HD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that is 
      manifested by a gradual loss of physical, cognitive, and mental abilities. As the 
      disease advances, age has a major impact on the pathogenic signature of mutant 
      huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregation. This review aims to explore the intricate 
      relationship between aging, mHTT toxicity, and cellular senescence in HD. 
      Scientific data on the interplay between aging, mHTT, and cellular senescence in 
      HD were collected from several academic databases, including PubMed, Google 
      Scholar, Google, and ScienceDirect. The search terms employed were "AGING," 
      "HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE," "MUTANT HUNTINGTIN," and "CELLULAR SENESCENCE." 
      Additionally, to gather information on the molecular mechanisms and potential 
      therapeutic targets, the search was extended to include relevant terms such as 
      "DNA DAMAGE," "OXIDATIVE STRESS," and "AUTOPHAGY." According to research, aging 
      leads to worsening HD pathophysiology through some processes. As a result of the 
      mHTT accumulation, cellular senescence is promoted, which causes DNA damage, 
      oxidative stress, decreased autophagy, and increased inflammatory responses. 
      Pro-inflammatory cytokines and other substances are released by senescent cells, 
      which may worsen the neuronal damage and the course of the disease. It has been 
      shown that treatments directed at these pathways reduce some of the HD symptoms 
      and enhance longevity in experimental animals, pointing to a new possibility of 
      treating the condition. Through their amplification of the harmful effects of 
      mHTT, aging and cellular senescence play crucial roles in the development of HD. 
      Comprehending these interplays creates novel opportunities for therapeutic 
      measures targeted at alleviating cellular aging and enhancing HD patients' 
      quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is defined by a wide variety of 
      metabolic abnormalities, persistent hyperglycemia, and a slew of other 
      complications. Catharanthus roseus L. (apocyanaceae), remarkably notable as Vinca 
      Rosea, appears to be the source of the active component hirsutidin, which is 
      reported in various diseases. OBJECTIVE: The study intended to appraise the 
      antidiabetic capability of hirsutidin in a high-fat diet (HFD) and streptozotocin 
      (STZ) induced diabetes in experimental rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An 
      experimental rodent T2DM model was elicited by consuming an HFD regimen with STZ 
      50 mg/kg, i.p. dose formulated in a 0.1 M cold citrate buffer (pH 4.5). The test 
      drug hirsutidin (10 and 20 mg/kg) and the standard drug glimeclamide (5 mg/kg) 
      were administered daily for six weeks. The efficacy of hirsutidin was observed on 
      several diabetes parameters. The average body weight and an array of biochemical 
      markers were determined, including blood glucose, insulin, dyslipidemia (lipid 
      profile), total protein (TP), liver injury [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], inflammation [IL-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis 
      factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)], oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA)] and antioxidant 
      status [catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)]. In 
      addition, the concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and resistin were also 
      assessed. Also, molecular docking studies were undertaken to investigate critical 
      targets associated with diabetes, including TNF-alpha, insulin, adiponectin, and 
      leptin. RESULTS: Diabetes induction with HFD/STZ resulted in hyperglycemia 
      (significantly reduced blood glucose and increased insulin level), dyslipidemia 
      (significantly reduced TC, TG and increased HDL), total protein (significantly 
      reduced), oxidative stress and antioxidant status (significantly reduced MDA and 
      increased CAT, SOD and GSH levels), inflammation (significantly decreased IL-6, 
      IL-1beta, TNF-alpha), liver damage (significantly reduced AST, ALT), and specific 
      hormones such as adiponectin, leptin significantly improved and resistin 
      significantly reduced as evidenced by biochemical data in this study. 
      Intermolecular interactions of ligands and docking score, hirsutidin proteins 
      TNF-alpha (2AZ5), Insulin (4IBM), Adiponectin (6KS1), Leptin (7Z3Q) with binding 
      energy of -6.708, -7.674, -7.2 and -7.547 Kcal/mol. CONCLUSION: Hirsutidin may 
      have an evidential hypoglycemic outcome and may exhibit potent antidiabetic 
      activity in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM in rats. Treatment with hirsutidin significantly 
      improved glycemic control, lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
      liver function. Additionally, it normalized dysregulated levels of adiponectin, 
      leptin, and resistin. Molecular docking confirmed its strong binding affinity to 
      key diabetic targets.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Data-driven methodologies in healthcare necessitate labeled data for 
      effective decision-making. However, medical data, particularly in unstructured 
      formats, such as clinical notes, often lack explicit labels, making manual 
      annotation challenging and tedious. METHODS: This paper introduces a novel deep 
      active learning framework designed to facilitate the annotation process for 
      multiclass text classification, specifically using the SOAP (subjective, 
      objective, assessment, plan) framework, a widely recognized medical protocol. Our 
      methodology leverages transformer-based deep learning techniques to automatically 
      annotate clinical notes, significantly easing the manual labor involved and 
      enhancing classification performance. Transformer-based deep learning models, 
      with their ability to capture complex patterns in large datasets, represent a 
      cutting-edge approach for advancing natural language processing tasks. RESULTS: 
      We validate our approach through experiments on a diverse set of clinical notes 
      from publicly available datasets, comprising over 426 documents. Our model 
      demonstrates superior classification accuracy, with an F1 score improvement of 
      4.8% over existing methods but also provides a practical tool for healthcare 
      professionals, potentially improving clinical documentation practices and patient 
      care. CONCLUSIONS: The research underscores the synergy between active learning 
      and advanced deep learning, paving the way for future exploration of automatic 
      text annotation and its implications for clinical informatics. Future studies 
      will aim to integrate multimodal data and large language models to enhance the 
      richness and accuracy of clinical text analysis, opening new pathways for 
      comprehensive healthcare insights.

AB  - This review article aims to summarize broadly recent developments in the 
      treatment of HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer and head and neck 
      squamous cell carcinoma. Relatively new treatments targeting the key HPV E6 and 
      E7 oncoproteins, including gene editing with TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9, are 
      discussed. Given the increased immunogenicity of HPV-related diseases, other 
      therapies such as PRR agonists, adoptive cell transfer, and tumor vaccines are 
      reaching the clinical trial phase. Due to the mechanism, immunogenicity, and 
      reversibility of HPV carcinogenesis, HPV-related cancers present unique targets 
      for current and future therapies.

TI  - 6-Shogaol Abrogates Parkinson's Disease in Rotenone-Induced Rodents: Based on In 
      Silico Study and Inhibiting TNF-alpha/NF-kappaB/IL-1beta/MAO-B.
LID - 10.3390/ph17101348 [doi]
LID - 1348
AB  - Background/Objectives: 6-Shogaol is a comparatively innovative anti-Parkinson's 
      remedy with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. This investigation 
      intended to determine the role of 6-shogaol in the Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      paradigm in rotenone-induced rats. Methods: Thirty male Wistar rats (10-12 weeks 
      old; 180 +/- 20 g) were divided into five groups. Animals with rotenone-induced 
      experimental PD were subsequently treated with 6-shogaol-10 at 20 mg/kg for 28 
      days. After the experimental duration, behavioural investigations were performed, 
      i.e., open field test, forced swim test, rotarod test, and catalepsy test. 
      Biochemical assessments like AChE, GSH, CAT, SOD, MDA, nitrite, ceruloplasmin, 
      proinflammatory markers such as IL-1beta, NF-kappaB, TNF-alpha, and catecholamines markers 
      (DA, GABA, and MAO-B) were determined. The docking procedure was conducted using 
      the AutoDock Vina docking protocol. Furthermore, histopathology was performed. 
      Results: Rotenone significantly increased the level of MAO-B, oxidative, 
      nitrative, and pro-inflammatory markers. However, there was a decline in 
      ceruloplasmin, dopamine, and endogenous antioxidants. Treatment with 6-shogaol 
      (10 and 20 mg/kg) considerably sustained the elevation of oxidative stress and 
      inflammatory indicators and decreased AChE activity and dopamine levels. In the 
      histology of the brain, 6-shogaol improved the neuronal structure and reduced the 
      degeneration of neurons. Based on the binding energy values, compound 6-shogaol 
      demonstrates a favourable binding affinity to AChE, MAO-B, DA, and GABA with 
      respective binding energies of -8.214, -8.133, -7.396 and -6.189 kcal/mol. 
      Conclusions: In this study, 6-shogaol exhibited neuroprotective properties 
      against PD, which could be employed as a prospective medication for PD.

TI  - Fustin, a Potent Phytochemical, Attenuates Scopolamine-induced Memory Impairment 
      and Neurodegeneration by Modulating Neuroinflammation and Neurotransmitters.
LID - 10.2174/0109298673330002241015085330 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fustin, a photogenic flavanol found in the plant Rhus verniciflua 
      Stokes, has been involved in multiple disease ailments and has a beneficial 
      pharmacological effect and a history of use in traditional medicine. The present 
      research aimed to study the impact of fustin on scopolamine (SCOP)-induced memory 
      impairment and neurodegeneration by modulating neuroinflammation and 
      neurotransmitters in rats. METHODS: A total of 30 healthy Wistar rats were 
      allocated into five groups (n=6). Group I- served as control and received saline 
      solution (1mL/kg i.p.), group -II- fustin (100 mg/kg, orally), group -III -SCOP 
      (1 mg/kg, i.p.), and group -IV and V were given fustin (50 and 100 mg/kg/p.o.) 
      with SCOP (1 mg/kg, i.p.) for 14-days. After 14 days, 2 hours after SCOP 
      injection, the Y-maze and Morris water maze (MWM) tests were performed. After 
      behavioral tests rats were subsequently euthanized, and brain supernatants were 
      used to estimate choline-acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), 
      antioxidant [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH)], 
      and total protein, oxidative stress markers [nitrate and malondialdehyde (MDA)], 
      pro-inflammatory markers [tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), and Interleukins-1beta 
      (IL-1beta) and IL-6]. Also, neurotransmitters such as serotonin (5-HT), dopamine 
      (DA), Upsilon-amino butyric acid (GABA), acetylcholine (Ach), and noradrenaline (NA) 
      contents were performed. RESULTS: Fustin exhibited substantial behavioral 
      improvement in the Y-maze measures spontaneous alterations percentage (SA%) and 
      decreased latency time following the acquisition and prolonged time spent in the 
      probe trial in the MWM test. Moreover, fustin inhibits enhanced neuroinflammatory 
      cytokines and oxidative stress markers and improves the neurotransmitters. 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that fustin inhibits SCOP impact 
      on cognitive abilities in rats. The present investigation demonstrates that 
      fustin, a potent phytochemical, effectively mitigated the behavioral and 
      physiological changes induced by SCOP in rats. This was primarily achieved by 
      modulating the levels of inflammatory response and neurotransmitters.

AB  - Floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) consist of buoyant rafts that support the 
      growth of macrophytes on waterbodies. The long-term performance of these rafts 
      depends on their buoyancy and resistance to weathering. Here, we present a 
      protocol for establishing low-cost FTWs for large-scale wastewater reclamation by 
      integrating traditional ecological knowledge with modern engineering principles. 
      We describe steps for setting up a plant nursery, designing and establishing the 
      FTWs, vegetating units, and building the FTW island. For complete details on the 
      use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Afzal et al.(1).

AB  - At present, a major effort in biophysical studies has been paid towards exploring 
      the interactions and release of therapeutic payloads to the specific site leaving 
      behind healthy cells unaffected and hence, lower the drug-induced toxicity. For 
      the purpose, interaction of beta-bound CUR with calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) has been 
      examined intensely using a series of biophysical methods like absorption, steady 
      state fluorescence emission, and circular dichroism together with molecular 
      docking study. The experimental analysis divulge that CUR interacts with both 
      beta-CD (although with different molar ratio) and DNA. However, the binding affinity 
      of CUR with the target (DNA) is higher than it does with the beta-CD. When 
      beta-CD-carried (10 mM) CUR (muM) (inclusion complex) comes near DNA (15-372 muM), CUR 
      gets out from beta-CD's void and approaches to binds with the DNA. The relocation of 
      the probe occurred due to competitive binding of the CUR between beta-CD and the 
      DNA. The present investigation may provide a simple yet probable route for the 
      transfer of encapsulated therapeutic payload of beta-CD to the most relevant 
      biomolecular target DNA.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) toxicity negatively impacts plant health and productivity. 
      Nanosilica (SiO(2)NPs) and salicylic acid (SA) enhance plant performance and 
      alleviate heavy metals stress. Yet, their combined effects against Cd-toxicity in 
      rice remained less-explored. Thus, a hydroponic study investigated the individual 
      and combined effects of SiO(2)NPs and SA on Cd-stress mitigation in rice at 
      physio-biochemical, cellular, and molecular levels. Results indicated that 
      Cd-alone treatment caused a significant reduction in rice growth and biomass and 
      photosynthetic efficiency, which was associated with oxidative damage caused by 
      enhanced Cd-accumulation in plant tissues. Cd-induction also potentiated its 
      phytotoxicity by triggering enzymatic antioxidants against the extra production 
      of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of SiO(2)NPs and/or SA markedly 
      minimized the Cd-induced toxicity by reducing Cd-bioaccumulation (42-56%), 
      protecting photosynthetic efficiency, which were directly correlated with 
      seedling biomass and restored cellular structures (leaf ultrastructure and 
      surface morphology). The combined application of SiO(2)NPs and SA was more 
      effective in activating antioxidant enzymes, phytohormones biosynthesis, and 
      reducing oxidative damages caused by Cd than sole application. This was evident 
      in the decreased production of ROS, malondialdehyde contents (29-37%), and 
      recovered membrane stability. Moreover, SiO(2)NPs and/or SA relieved 
      Cd-bioaccumulation (41-56%) by downregulating the Cd-related transporter genes 
      (OsNramp1, OsNramp5, OsHMA2, and OsHMA3). Altogether, the cellular 
      Cd-accumulation, photosynthesis, antioxidant defense, and phytohormones against 
      oxidative stress can be ideal markers for cultivating rice in Cd-contaminated 
      soils.

AB  - PURPOSE: Target motion monitoring plays a significant role in several 
      computer-assisted interventions. However, ensuring the reliability of tracking 
      algorithms can be challenging without adequate tools. We introduce 
      SlicerCineTrack, a free open-source research toolkit, designed to provide users 
      with a user-friendly interface for visualizing their target tracking results. 
      METHODS: SlicerCineTrack was developed as an extension to 3D Slicer. It enables 
      users to visualize target tracking results by sequentially playing back cine 
      medical images, and simultaneously overlaying the target segmentation at the 
      locations indicated by the tracking results. The extension was evaluated by 
      established experts in computer-assisted interventions and image-guided therapy. 
      RESULTS: SlicerCineTrack is available for download from the 3D Slicer extension 
      catalog for stable releases, and its GitHub repository for preview releases. 
      Evaluation results demonstrate SlicerCineTrack's effectiveness in discriminating 
      between different tracking performances. Moreover, the experts found the 
      extension convenient to use due to its intuitive and user-friendly interface. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SlicerCineTrack was found to be effective at verifying the 
      reliability of tracking algorithms. In turn, SlicerCineTrack shows potential for 
      target tracking verification, as well as algorithm validation and refining 
      through parameter tuning.

LID - 10.1088/1748-605X/ad971e [doi]
AB  - Conventional drug delivery systems often suffer from non-specific distribution 
      and limited therapeutic efficacy, leading to significant side effects. To address 
      these challenges, we developed magnetoelectric, cobalt ferrite@barium titanate 
      (CFO@BTO) nanofibers (NFs), with a core-shell structure for targeted anticancer 
      drug delivery. The electrospinning method was employed to synthesize polymeric 
      NFs based on magnetoelectric core-shell nanostructures. The scanning electron 
      microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction and Vibrating 
      sample magnetometer analysis confirmed the successful loading of nanostructures 
      on polymeric NF, the core-shell morphology and magnetoelectric phase of CFO@BTO, 
      respectively. UV-Vis spectroscopy was applied to verify the drug attachment, the 
      optimization of drug release in an applied external magnetic field (MF), and the 
      time required for control drug release. The effectiveness of MF-assisted 
      controlled drug release was demonstrated by achieving a 95 +/- 1.03% drug release 
      from magnetoelectric NFs (MENFs) within 30 min under a MF of 4 mT.In 
      vitrocytotoxicity assay on human skin cancer (SK-MEL-28) cell lines exhibited a 
      maximum 90 +/- 2% cytotoxicity with 2 +/- 0.03 cm of drug loaded MENFs. Furthermore, 
      the Hemolysis assay was carried out to affirm the biocompatibility and 
      non-toxicity of drug loaded MENFs, which is suitable for anticancer therapy.

TI  - The Thematic Analysis of Barriers to Immediate Post-Partum Long-Acting Reversible 
      Contraception.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare12222208 [doi]
LID - 2208
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, many women express the desire to avoid immediate pregnancy 
      for 24 months postdelivery, and only forty percent use contraceptives during this 
      period. There is an enormous demand for postpartum family planning, particularly 
      in developing countries with low- or middle-income grades. Postpartum 
      intrauterine devices such as long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are 
      among the most effective methods of family planning in the immediate postpartum 
      period, yet their effectiveness is hindered because of a lack of availability and 
      training. Strategies to increase access to LARCs are essential. Hence, the 
      purpose of the current study is to determine the barriers among healthcare 
      providers in providing immediate postpartum family planning services. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Obstetrics and 
      Gynaecology at SIMS, a tertiary care teaching hospital, from January to March 
      2024. Approximately 293 healthcare providers who fulfilled the inclusion criteria 
      were provided an online questionnaire in the form of a Google Forms link, which 
      included a structured questionnaire focusing on various aspects, including 
      demographics, knowledge, practices, and barriers in their practice. The data 
      collected were analysed through SPSS version 26, which employs chi-square tests 
      and Pearson's correlation to determine any significant associations among them. 
      Based on the key statistical outcomes and the significant correlations observed 
      related to the data, a thematic analysis through SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, 
      opportunities, threats) was conducted. The study adhered to the method outlined 
      by Braun and Clarke (2006) and compiled with the COREQ (consolidated criteria for 
      reporting qualitative research) checklist to uphold methodological integrity. 
      RESULTS: Among the participants, 92.4% provided family planning counselling after 
      childbirth, predominantly during the antenatal period (75.1%), and the provision 
      of immediate postnatal family planning was reported in 76.1% of the participants, 
      with PPIUDs identified as the most utilized method by 52.6%. Various barriers 
      were identified, including insufficient training on Implanon (33.4%) and the 
      PPIUCD (12.6%), the unavailability of implants (59.0%), and a lack of interest 
      among patients (46.1%). Statistically significant associations were observed 
      between the practice setting and knowledge of postpartum family planning (p = 
      0.002), as well as deficiencies in training for the PPIUCD (p < 0.001). The study 
      highlights the place of practice and the practitioners' experience as significant 
      strengths in offering immediate postpartum contraception and referring patients 
      for family planning. However, qualification was identified as a limiting factor 
      for practicing immediate postpartum family planning. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      revealed significant difficulty in delivering prompt postpartum long-acting 
      reversible contraceptives (LARCs), underscoring the necessity of improved 
      education and training for professionals. Focusing on these challenges is 
      important in enhancing postpartum family planning acceptance and decreasing 
      unfulfilled requirements in resource-limited settings.

TI  - Rosiridin Protects Against Aluminum Chloride-Induced Memory Impairment via 
      Modulation of BDNF/NFkappaB/PI3K/Akt Pathway in Rats.
LID - 10.3390/medicina60111812 [doi]
LID - 1812
AB  - Background and Objectives: Rosiridin is a monoterpene with outstanding monoamine 
      inhibitory activity that is useful to treat depressive episodes and rapid-onset 
      dementia. The current investigation aims to evaluate the neurologically 
      protective impact of rosiridin, which opposes aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)) and 
      causes memory dysfunction in rats. Materials and Methods: Memory impairment was 
      developed in Wistar rats by administering AlCl(3) (100 mg/kg p.o.) orally for 42 
      days and then supplemented with rosiridin at 10 and 20 mg/kg/p.o. Upon completion 
      of the investigation, the behavior factor was performed utilizing the Y-maze, 
      Morris Water Maze, and open field tests. Estimating numerous biological factors, 
      such as nitric oxide (NO), oxidative stress (malondialdehyde MDA), 
      acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase levels (BuChE), antioxidants 
      (glutathione GSH, catalase CAT, and superoxide dismutases SODs) and 
      neurotransmitter (serotonin-5HT, dopamine-DA, acetylcholine-Ach) in the brain. 
      Furthermore, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), 
      brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), nuclear factor kappa B (NFᴋB), 
      phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and pAkt were assessed in the diffused 
      brain cells. Results: The rosiridin-treated group significantly improved in terms 
      of behavioral parameters, including in the Y-maze, Morris Water Maze, and open 
      field tests. Further, rosiridin restored biochemical parameters, including NO, 
      oxidative stress AChE, BuChE, antioxidants, neurotransmitters, IL-6, IL-1beta, 
      TNF-alpha, BNDF, NFᴋB, PI3K, and pAkt compared to AlCl(3). Conclusions: The current 
      investigation reveals that rosiridin could ameliorate the impairment of memory 
      that AlCl3 causes in rats via improvements in behavioral and restored biochemical 
      parameters.

AB  - Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) crucially contribute to lung cancer's 
      advancement and escape from the immune system. TAMs, particularly the M2 
      phenotype, promote an immunosuppressive microenvironment, facilitating tumor 
      growth and metastasis. The MEK-STAT3 signalling pathway is a critical mediator in 
      this process, driving TAM reprogramming and contributing to lung cancer's 
      resistance to treatment. Inhibiting the MEK and STAT3 pathways disrupts key 
      cancer-promoting mechanisms, including immune evasion, angiogenesis, and 
      metastasis. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of MEK 
      inhibitors, such as trametinib and selumetinib, in synergistic therapies for 
      NSCLC, particularly in modulating the tumor microenvironment. We analyse the 
      present understanding of approaches that can transform TAMs via the inhibition of 
      MEK-STAT3 with either solo or combined treatments in lung cancer therapy.

AB  - The lipocalin carrier protein, beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg), stands out as a crucial 
      protein in the food industry, known for its ability to effectively bind with 
      hydrophobic small molecules. However, it was unclear how beta-lg interacts with 
      macrocyclic molecules. In this research, we focused on two key aspects. First, we 
      synthesized a 24-membered macrocycle 4d by modifying a natural product chalcone 
      to create a macrocycle by connecting two ortho-hydroxyl groups of each phenyl 
      ring of two chalcone units with alkyl chains. To enhance solubility, we converted 
      the chalcone CC bonds to epoxide rings. Second, we investigated the binding 
      ability and mechanism of binding of the compound with the beta-lg. The beta-lg and 4d 
      interaction shows an isoemissive point at 382 nm with K(b) = 4.64 +/- 0.02 x 10(5) 
      at 298 K, indicating the excellent protein binding ability of 4d. Remarkably, 
      despite its size, 4d binds to the protein without altering its conformation, 
      suggesting the availability of a spacious binding site on the protein where the 
      molecule fits well. Molecular docking analysis confirmed the presence of such a 
      site at the mouth of the calyx. Additionally, our 200 ns molecular dynamics 
      simulation demonstrated that 4d adopts a conformation to interact with the 
      hydrophobic amino acids of the binding site, ultimately stabilizing the protein.

AB  - AIM: Nitrogen and sulfur-containing compounds are the core components utilized 
      for synthesis of different heterocyclic moieties. METHODS & RESULTS: In this 
      research, a series of new analogues containing thiazolidinone have been 
      synthesized (1-20) in order to evaluate their activity against 
      acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. Potent analogues were further 
      subjected for molecular docking in order to study their protein-ligand 
      interactions. The highly active analogues were also subjected for DFT, which 
      confirmed the binding properties, electrical properties, and nature with the 
      targeted enzyme. ADMET analysis also confirms the druglikeness properties of the 
      synthesized series. CONCLUSION: Analog 5 (IC(50) = 1.2 +/- 0.1 microM and 1.8 +/- 0.2 microM) 
      exhibit excellent inhibition in comparison with the standard drug donepezil in 
      view of inhibiting Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Parkinson's disease is a prevalent neurological condition that affects around 1% 
      of adults over 60 worldwide. Deep brain stimulation and dopamine replacement 
      therapy are common therapies for Parkinson's disease, yet they are unable to 
      reverse the disease it simply because of the blood brain barrier. The use of 
      bioengineered exosomes to treat Parkinson's disease is being studied because they 
      have the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Their natural ability to cross 
      the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and their biocompatibility make them highly 
      suitable for delivering therapeutic agents to manage PD, specifically the role of 
      astrocytes, microglial cells, and alpha-synuclein. It also explores the 
      biogenesis and preparation of these bioengineered exosomes. In comparison to 
      conventional nanocarriers, the modified exosomal-membrane-camouflaged abiotic 
      nanocarriers show improved resilience and compatibility. Improved cellular 
      absorption and targeted delivery of therapeutic payloads, such as medications and 
      enzymes, are being shown in laboratory trials. A viable strategy for treating PD 
      involves combining abiotic nanocarriers with bioengineered exosomal membranes. 
      Despite their promising potential, successful clinical application requires 
      overcoming hurdles related to scalable production, regulatory approval, and 
      long-term safety evaluation. Nevertheless, the innovative use of bioengineered 
      exosomes holds significant promise for advancing PD management and improving 
      patient outcomes through more targeted and effective therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Pancreatic cancer is a highly fatal malignancy due to poor early detection rate 
      and resistance to conventional therapies. This review examines the potential for 
      liquid biopsy as a transformative technology to identify diagnostic and 
      therapeutic targets in pancreatic cancer. Specifically, we explore emerging 
      biomarkers such as exosomal non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), circulating tumor DNA 
      (ctDNA), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Tumor-derived exosomes contain 
      nucleic acid and protein that reflect the unique molecular landscape of the 
      malignancy and can serve as an alternative diagnostic approach vs traditional 
      biomarkers like CA19-9. Herein we highlight exosomal miRNAs, lncRNAs, and other 
      ncRNAs alongside ctDNA and CTC-based strategies, evaluating their combined 
      ability to improve early detection, disease monitoring and treatment response. 
      Furthermore, the therapeutic implications of ncRNAs such as lncRNA UCA1 and 
      miR-3960 in chemoresistance and progression are also discussed via suppression of 
      EZH2 and PTEN/AKT pathways. Emerging therapeutic strategies that target the 
      immune response, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and drug resistance are 
      explored. This review demonstrates a paradigm shift in pancreatic cancer 
      management toward personalized, less invasive and more effective approaches.

TI  - Chronic kidney disease and aging: dissecting the p53/p21 pathway as a therapeutic 
      target.
PG  - 32
LID - 10.1007/s10522-024-10173-z [doi]
AB  - Chronic kidney diseases (CKD) are a group of multi-factorial disorders that 
      markedly impair kidney functions with progressive renal deterioration. Aging 
      contributes to age-specific phenotypes in kidneys, which undergo several 
      structural and functional alterations, such as a decline in regenerative capacity 
      and increased fibrosis, inflammation, and tubular atrophy, all predisposing them 
      to disease and increasing their susceptibility to injury while impeding their 
      recovery. A central feature of these age-related processes is the activation of 
      the p53/p21 pathway signaling. The pathway is a key player in cellular 
      senescence, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation, which are all key to 
      maintaining the health of the kidney. P53 is a transcription factor and a tumor 
      suppressor protein that responds to cell stress and damage. Persistent activation 
      of cell p53 can lead to the expression of p21, an inhibitor of the cell cycle 
      known as a cyclin-dependent kinase. This causes cells to cease dividing and leads 
      to senescence, where cells can no longer increase. The accumulation of senescent 
      cells in the aging kidney impairs kidney function by altering the 
      microenvironment. As the number of senescent cells increases, the capacity of the 
      kidney to recover from injury decreases, accelerating the progression of 
      end-stage renal disease. This article review extensively explores the 
      relationship between the p53/p21 pathway and cellular senescence within an aging 
      kidney and the emerging therapeutic strategies that target it to overcome the 
      impacts of cellular senescence on CKD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Liquid-based cytology (LBC) is a newer method of preparing cervical 
      cell samples. This technique involves collecting cells in a liquid fixative and 
      preparing and evaluating them. AIM: This study aims to investigate cervical 
      smears prepared using the Ezi-Prep LBC method and analyze the positivity rate for 
      cervical cancer and assess the diagnostic accuracy of LBC in detecting cervical 
      abnormalities among females with abnormal vaginal conditions attending a tertiary 
      care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present diagnostic study was performed in 
      a tertiary care hospital over a period of 1 year (April 1, 2021-November 30, 
      2021). A total of 230 women, aged 21-70 years, presented at the gynecology 
      outpatient department for either routine cervical screening or with complaints of 
      vaginal bleeding, discharge, or pelvic pain. Cervical smears were prepared using 
      the Ezi-Prep method and stained with ULTRA-PAP stain. RESULTS: LBC smears are 
      monolayer smears and are without nuclear overlapping with spread over a diameter 
      of 16 mm. Minimum cellular overlapping and crowding were observed in LBC smears. 
      The mean age of the participants was 35.5 +/- 5.1 years. The smears were studied by 
      using nine morphological parameters. CONCLUSION: The majority of the smears were 
      inflammatory smears. A total of 16 cases and three cases were found to be 
      bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis, respectively. In an 8-month study, HSIL was 
      found in two cases, whereas LSIL was found in only one case. The positivity rate 
      was observed to be 0.9% in HSIL cases and 0.4% in LSIL cases, 0.9% ASC-US case, 
      and 0.4% invasive carcinoma case.

      Review.

AB  - Cancer is one of the most devastating illnesses in the world, impacting millions 
      of individuals every year. Despite various therapies, the final effect is 
      unsatisfactory. Chemotherapy currently dominates as the primary option of 
      treatment. However, its severe adverse effects, limited efficacy, and resistance 
      to drugs undermine its potential. Growing evidence suggests that ginsenoside Rg3, 
      a natural compound obtained from the ginseng plant (Panax ginseng), holds 
      significant promise in cancer therapy. Its proposed mechanisms primarily involve 
      the enhancement of immunity, retardation of cancer cellular proliferation and 
      metastasis, triggering apoptosis, angiogenesis, epigenetic modification, and 
      Regulation of transition of epithelial mesenchyma (EMT) and miRNAs/lncRNA. 
      Furthermore, Rg3-ginsenoside potentiates the effectiveness of conventional 
      treatments of cancer and reduces the adverse effects through synergistic 
      interactions. Ginsenoside Rg3's present status in cancer research is thoroughly 
      reviewed in this article, shedding light on its intricate mechanisms and 
      potential to revolutionize cancer therapy through combinatorial and nano-based 
      targeted therapy.

TI  - Molecular profiling of BRCA1/BRCA2 gene variants in Pakistani breast cancer 
      patients.
PG  - 37-40
LID - 10.47391/JPMA.11098 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of genetic variants in breast cancer types 
      1 and 2 gene in breast cancer Pakistani patients. METHODS: The case-control study 
      was conducted at the Islamic International Medical College and Pakistan Railway 
      Hospital, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from October 2022 to August 2023, and comprised 
      females with breast cancer in group A, with an age range of 23-83 years (mean 
      51.9 +/- 10.8 years) and as many healthy, age-matched female controls in group B, 
      with age range of 26-82 years(mean 57.8 +/-10.1 years). Peripheral blood samples 
      were taken from all the participants. Allele-specific tetra amplification 
      refractory mutation system-polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the 
      frequency of c.4485G>A, c.4508C>A, c.5278G>C and c.5503C>T genetic variants in 
      breast cancer type 1 gene, and c.92G>A and c.3109C>T genetic variants in breast 
      cancer type 2 gene. Data was analysed using SPSS 27. RESULTS: Of the 336 female 
      participants 168(50%) were in each of the 2 groups. None of the group B controls 
      had genetic variants in breast cancer type 1 and 2 genes. In group A patients, 
      4(2.3%) had the variant c.4485G>A in breast cancer type 1 gene, while other 
      breast cancer type 1 variants were negative. Also, 9(5.3%) group A patients had 
      variants c.92G>A and c.3109C>T in breast cancer type 2 gene. CONCLUSION: 
      Cost-effective, polymerase chain reaction-based genetic testing could effectively 
      identify mutant variants of breast cancer types 1 and 2 genes in the Pakistani 
      population.

TI  - Targeting senescence and GATA4 in age-related cardiovascular disease: a 
      comprehensive approach.
PG  - 45
LID - 10.1007/s10522-025-10189-z [doi]
AB  - The growing prevalence of age-related cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) poses 
      significant health challenges, necessitating the formulation of novel treatment 
      approaches. GATA4, a vital transcription factor identified for modulating 
      cardiovascular biology and cellular senescence, is recognized for its critical 
      involvement in CVD pathogenesis. This review collected relevant studies from 
      PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct using search terms like 'GATA4,' 
      'cellular senescence,' 'coronary artery diseases,' 'hypertension,' 'heart 
      failure,' 'arrhythmias,' 'congenital heart diseases,' 'cardiomyopathy,' and 
      'cardiovascular disease.' Additionally, studies investigating the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying GATA4-mediated regulation of GATA4 and senescence in CVDs 
      were analyzed to provide comprehensive insights into this critical aspect of 
      potential treatment targeting. Dysregulation of GATA4 is involved in a variety of 
      CVDs, as demonstrated by both experimental and clinical research, comprising CAD, 
      hypertension, congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and cardiac 
      insufficiency. Furthermore, cellular senescence enhances the advancement of 
      age-related CVDs. These observations suggested that therapies targeting GATA4, 
      senescence pathways, or both as necessary may be an effective intervention in CVD 
      progression and prognosis. Addressing age-related CVDs by targeting GATA4 and 
      senescence is a broad mechanism approach. It implies further investigation of the 
      molecular nature of these processes and elaboration of an effective therapeutic 
      strategy. This review highlights the importance of GATA4 and senescence in CVD 
      pathogenesis, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets for age-related 
      CVDs.

AB  - Mushrooms are considered one of the safe and effective medications because they 
      have great economic importance due to countless biological properties. Cordyceps 
      militaris contains bioactive compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and 
      anti-cancerous properties. This study was projected to analyze the potentials of 
      biometabolites and to extract antimicrobial peptides and protein from the C. 
      militaris. An in-vitro analysis of biometabolites and antimicrobial peptides was 
      performed to investigate their pharmacological potentials followed by 
      quantification and characterization of extracted protein. Computational analysis 
      on non-small cell lung cancer genes (NSCLC) was performed on quantified compounds 
      to interpret the biometabolites from C. militaris that could be potential drug 
      candidate molecules with high specificity and potency. A total of 34 compounds 
      representing 100% of total detected constituents identified were identified using 
      GCMS analysis and 20 compounds using LC-MS which showed strong biological 
      activities. FT-IR spectroscopy manifest powerful instant peaks to have different 
      bioactive components including carboxylic acid, phenols, amines and alkanes 
      present in methanolic extract of C. militaris. In C. militaris, higher protein 
      concentration was observed in 70% concentration of protein extract (500 mug/ml +/- 
      0.025). The best antioxidant activity (% Radical scavenging activity) of 
      methanolic extracts was 80a +/- 0.03, antidiabetic activity was 37 +/- 0.057 and 
      anti-inflammatory activity was 40 +/- 0.021 at 12 mg/ml. Antibacterial activity for 
      different concentrations of Cordyceps protein and methanolic extracts was 
      significantly (p < 0.05). Indolizine, 2-(4-methylphenyl) has most binding 
      affinity (micromolar) and optimized properties to be selected as the lead 
      inhibitor. It interacts favorably with the active site of RET gene of NSCLC and 
      is neuroprotective and hepatoprotective.

AB  - Europinidin is a novel anthocyanidin found in the petals of Plumbago europea that 
      exhibits several physiological effects. Research was conducted to assess 
      europinidin's cardioprotective efficacy in a diabetic and myocardial infarction 
      (MI) experimental model. Rat was injected through the intraperitoneal 
      administration of 45 mg/kg of streptozotocin (STZ), while MI was induced by 
      subcutaneously administering 85 mg/kg of isoproterenol (ISP) at 24 and 48 h prior 
      to the sacrifice procedure. Europinidin 10 and 20 mg/day was administered orally 
      for 4 weeks after validation of diabetes (glucose > 250 mg/dl) on the 7th day. 
      Experimental rats were randomly allocated to control, STZ-ISP control, 
      STZ-ISP + europinidin-10 mg, STZ-ISP + europinidin-20 mg and europinidin 20 mg 
      perse group. Biochemicals parameters including anti-diabetic (Glucose, HbA1c, 
      serum insulin), cardiac markers (hs-CRP, CPK-MB), dyslipidaemia (lipid analysis), 
      anti-inflammatory (IL6, TNF-alpha and IL-beta), oxidative stress (MDA) and antioxidant 
      (SOD, CAT and GSH), kidney function (creatinine), liver function (AST) and 
      pancreatic function (lipase) along with apoptosis markers (Bcl-2, caspase-3) were 
      evaluated. In addition, histopathological indices of heart injury were 
      investigated. In addition, molecular docking (AUTODOCK Tools 1.5.6.) and dynamics 
      were performed. Europinidin (10 and 20 mg/day) reduced blood glucose, HbA1c, 
      hs-CRP, and CPK-MB. It improved serum insulin, blood lipid profile and reduced 
      inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-beta), oxidative stress and increased 
      antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and GSH). Europinidin also protected renal, hepatic 
      functions and restored apoptosis markers (increased Bcl-2, decreased caspase-3 
      levels). Histopathological analysis demonstrated a reduced extent of myocardial 
      necrosis and fibrosis. Europinidin binds in silico to proteins 1NME, 1I0E, 3I2Y 
      and 4AQ3 with energies of -7.038, -6.682, -8.6 and - 8.761 kcal/mol, 
      respectively. While molecular dynamics simulation studies supported the 
      interactions of europinidin with important therapeutic target proteins. 
      Europinidin demonstrates significant cardioprotective and anti-diabetic potential 
      in a diabetic MI experimental model.

TI  - Exploration of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG from Bacillus tropicus as an 
      eco-friendly approach for the degradation of polycyclic aromatic compounds.
PG  - 3466

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are pervasive environmental contaminants 
      derived from diverse sources including pyrogenic (e.g., combustion processes), 
      petrogenic (e.g., crude oil), and biological origins. They are commonly found in 
      gasoline, coal, and crude oil, reflecting their prevalence and varied origins in 
      natural and anthropogenic activities. The aim of this study is to use Bacillus 
      tropicus which is a spore-forming, gram-positive and facultative anaerobic 
      bacteria, containing a gene for PACs degradtion. In this study bacterial sample 
      was collected from women's vaginal discharge through streaking and spreading 
      techniques. The DNA was extracted from bacterial culture and then the bacterium 
      was identified through 16S rRNA which appeared to be B.tropicus. Then the 
      computational analysis was conducted where the sequence similarity and functional 
      analysis of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG protein from B.tropicus was analyzed 
      through PSI-BLAT and SMART tool, respectively. The PSI-BLAST showed 100% query 
      coverage score and 9 domains of alcohol dehydrogenase EutG protein were predicted 
      through SMART tool. The quality of the protein was also assessed through ProQ 
      server with a predicted LQ score of 8.091, a Maxsub score of - 0.350 and a z 
      score of - 10.76. Then the phylogentic analysis was conducted to know the 
      evolutionary relationship and closely related taxa. The 3D structure of the 
      protein was predicted through SWISS MODEL and its quality was predicted through 
      ERRAT with overall qauality factor of 98.708. The Ramachandran plot also 
      predicted its quality and showed that 93.8% residues were in the most favored 
      region. After this, 3D stucture of PACs were obtained from PubChem and molecular 
      docking of the protein was performed with each of the compound. The lowest energy 
      of - 10.3 was obtained with Indeno[1,2,3-cd] pyrene and the best docked complex 
      was visulaized through discover studio to analyze its binding residues. Lastly, 
      in-silico site-directed mutagenesis studies were performed which showed that the 
      EutG gene (codes for alcoholic dehydrogenase) obtained from B. tropicus, will not 
      get altered or have any decreasing effect on the enzyme's stability if it goes 
      through any mutations. This suggests that B. tropicus can act as an efficient, 
      non-virulent, and reliable candidate for the eco-friendly and cost-effective 
      bioremediation of PACs.

AB  - This study aimed to explore a nanogel formulation containing acemannan as a 
      carrier for the treatment of psoriasis-like skin inflammation. Several acemannan 
      concentrations, such as F1 (2.5 %) and F2 (5 %), were used to prepare the nanogel 
      formulation by homogenization. The formulation was then assessed for in-vitro 
      performance. Four groups of animals were randomly assigned to the animals: 
      Cluster I consisted of normal saline control; Cluster II was assigned Imiquimod 
      (IMQ) control (5 %); Cluster III was assigned IMQ + 2.5 % acemannan (F1); and 
      Cluster IV was assigned IMQ + 5 % acemannan (F2). The effectiveness of the gel in 
      the in vivo study was evaluated in terms of body weight, scaly skin, skin 
      redness, inflammation, patches, moisturizing effect, pro-inflammatory cytokines, 
      nitric oxide, and histopathological examination. The prepared nanogel possessed 
      the desired characteristics in terms of in vitro evaluation parameters. The 
      average particle size was around 199.6 nm, with a polydispersibility index (PDI) 
      of 0.338 and a zeta potential of -65.9 mV. The nanogel formulation significantly 
      (P < 0.05) regulated in vivo performance, including redness, scaly skin, 
      inflammation, patches, moisturizing effect, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and 
      nitric oxide. The histopathological findings suggested that acemannan was 
      effective in rejuvenating the affected skin.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Dental caries is the most prevalent chronic infectious disease 
      globally, with Streptococcus mutans recognized as a primary causative agent due 
      to its acidogenicity and robust biofilm-forming ability. In S. mutans biofilm 
      formation, the role of autoinducers has been extensively studied, while the 
      influence of other small molecules remains largely unexplored. Mutanofactins, a 
      class of polyketide/non-ribosomal lipopeptide secondary metabolites, are emerging 
      as potential modulators of S. mutans biofilm development. METHODS: Transcriptomic 
      analysis was conducted to examine gene expression patterns in S. mutans NMT4863 
      across distinct growth phases and lifestyles, aiming to identify metabolic 
      factors influencing biofilm formation. Transcriptomic profiles were compared 
      between cells in early-, mid-, and late-exponential-, and stationary phase, as 
      well as between planktonic and biofilm cells. Differentially expressed genes were 
      identified, and pathway analyses revealed significant alterations in key 
      metabolic and regulatory pathways. Specifically, the biosynthetic mutanofactin 
      gene cluster was analyzed via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. 
      RESULTS: Several genes and operons were differentially expressed across the 
      tested growth phases, with 1,095 genes showing differential expression between 
      stationary-phase, planktonic and biofilm cells. Pathway analysis revealed 
      significant changes in ascorbate metabolism, carbohydrate utilization and 
      transport systems, lipoic acid metabolism, bacterial toxin pathways, 
      two-component regulatory systems, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Notably, 
      expression of the muf gene cluster, was elevated in early exponential-phase cells 
      relative to stationary-phase cells. Additionally, the mufCDEFGHIJ genes were 
      identified as components of a single transcriptional unit (muf operon). MufC, a 
      transcriptional regulator of the TetR/AcrR-family, acts as a positive regulator 
      of the muf operon in strain NMT4863. Bioinformatic analysis pinpointed a 20-bp 
      regulatory sequence in the muf operon promoter region 
      (5'-AAATGAGCTATAATTCATTT-3'). Interestingly, the muf operon was found to be 
      significantly downregulated in biofilm cells. CONCLUSION: This study provides key 
      insights into gene expression dynamics that drive biofilm formation in S. mutans 
      NMT4863, with a particular emphasis on the role of the muf operon. This operon is 
      governed by the TetR/AcrR-family regulator MufC and plays a central role in 
      biofilm development, offering a novel perspective on the molecular basis of S. 
      mutans biofilm formation and resilience.

TI  - The interplay of p16INK4a and non-coding RNAs: bridging cellular senescence, 
      aging, and cancer.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1007/s10522-025-10194-2 [doi]
AB  - p16INK4a is a crucial tumor suppressor and regulator of cellular senescence, 
      forming a molecular bridge between aging and cancer. Dysregulated p16INK4a 
      expression is linked to both premature aging and cancer progression, where 
      non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) such as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), microRNAs 
      (miRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play key roles in modulating its 
      function. These ncRNAs interact with p16INK4a through complex 
      post-transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms, influencing pathways critical to 
      senescence and tumor suppression. In this review, we explore ncRNAs, including 
      ANRIL, MIR31HG, UCA1, MALAT1, miR-24, miR-30, and miR-141, which collectively 
      regulate p16INK4a expression, promoting or inhibiting pathways associated with 
      cancer and aging. ANRIL and MIR31HG modulate p16INK4a silencing via interactions 
      with polycomb repressive complexes (PRC), while miRNAs such as miR-24 and miR-30 
      target p16INK4a to influence cellular proliferation and senescence. This 
      regulatory interplay underscores the therapeutic potential of ncRNA-targeted 
      strategies to restore p16INK4a function. We summarize recent studies supporting 
      that ncRNAs that control p16INK4a may be diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic 
      targets for age-related diseases and cancer.

TI  - Effects of a Rosiridin against Rotenone-induced Rats' Model of Parkinson's 
      Disease: In-vivo Study and in silico Molecular Modeling.
PG  - 1095-118
LID - 10.2174/011570159X349553250126050134 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The investigation aimed to study the outcome of rosiridin in Parkinson's 
      disease (PD) induced by rotenone (ROT) in rodents. METHODS: Rodents were 
      randomized into IV groups and were induced with ROT followed by treatment with 
      rosiridin. Group I-IV received saline as a vehicle, II-ROT (0.5 mg/kg S.C) for 28 
      consecutive days, III and IV- rosiridin 10 and 20 mg/kg orally with ROT. On 
      completion of the experimental duration, behavioral investigations were carried 
      out. Biochemical variables such as acetylcholinesterase (AChE), oxidative stress 
      and antioxidants markers (Malondialdehyde-MDA, glutathione-GSH, superoxide 
      dismutase-SOD, and catalase-CAT), anti-inflammatory (Interleukin-1 beta-IL-1beta, 
      IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNF-alpha), alteration in neurotransmitters 
      (Serotonin-5-HT), norepinephrine, and dopamine-DA, along with metabolites such as 
      5-hydroxy indole acetic acid-5- HIAA),), mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and 
      caspase-3 activity were evaluated at the end of the experiment. Furthermore, 
      molecular docking and dynamics were performed for target ligands. RESULTS: 
      Rosiridin significantly restored the level of AChE, oxidative stress and 
      antioxidants markers (MDA, GSH, SOD, and CAT), anti-inflammatory (IL-1beta, IL-6, 
      and TNF-alpha), alteration in neurotransmitters, mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and 
      caspase-3 activity. Rosiridin has a favorable negative binding affinity to AChE 
      (-8.99 kcal/mol). The results of the molecular dynamics simulations indicate that 
      proteins undergo a substantial change in conformational dynamics when binding to 
      rosiridin. CONCLUSION: In this study, rosiridin may exhibit neuroprotective 
      properties against the Parkinson's model for treating PD.

LID - e0315827
AB  - The genus Ruellia L. belongs to this family and its plants are herbs or shrubs. 
      This genus was first detected in the tropical and subtropical regions. The 
      primary objective this study is to identify the various species within the genus 
      Ruellia using both morphological characteristics and DNA barcoding methods. For 
      this purpose, plant samples were meticulously collected from eight distinct 
      natural habitats across the region. All vegetative and floral parts were examined 
      using a binocular microscope. All parts are measured and photographed. To ensure 
      accurate identification and characterization, four molecular barcoding markers 
      were employed: Psbk-psbi, trnH-psbA, rbcL, and AtpF-AtpH. Eight Ruellia species 
      were identified from different regions: Abha, Aseer (24651), Jazan (24652), 
      Malacosperma, Patula, Taif (24650 rose), Taif (24650 violet), and Taif (24650 
      white). The species were confirmed using specimens from the King Saud University 
      herbarium. Notably, the samples collected from Taif, which had flowers of 
      different colors, were determined to represent a single species with different 
      genotypes. The use of four DNA barcode markers (Psbk-psbi, trnH-psbA, rbcL, and 
      AtpF-AtpH) facilitated the identification of five distinct species: R. tweediana, 
      R. sp. SH2010, R. carolinensis, R. simplex, and R. patula. These findings 
      confirmed the dominant Ruellia species in Saudi Arabia and demonstrated the 
      reliability of DNA barcode markers for species identification. Further assessment 
      of these species' adaptability, molecular genetics, and functional genomics is 
      necessary for their commercial utilization in the region. These species are 
      recorded for the first time in Saudi Arabia and represent the first record.

      Bridging Basic Science and Clinical Practice.
LID - 10.3390/life15020209 [doi]
LID - 209
AB  - Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a major public health challenge 
      globally. Recent innovations in diagnostic technology have opened new pathways 
      for early detection, ongoing monitoring, and more individualized patient care, 
      yet significant barriers persist in translating these advancements into clinical 
      settings. This review highlights the cutting-edge diagnostic methods emerging 
      from basic science research, including molecular assays, biosensors, and 
      next-generation sequencing, and discusses the practical and logistical challenges 
      involved in their implementation. By analyzing current trends in diagnostic 
      techniques and management strategies, we identify critical gaps and propose 
      integrative approaches to bridge the divide between laboratory innovation and 
      effective clinical application. This work emphasizes the need for comprehensive 
      education, supportive infrastructure, and multi-disciplinary collaborations to 
      enhance the utility of these diagnostic innovations in improving outcomes in 
      patients with HIV.

AB  - Aging and metabolic disorders share intricate molecular pathways, with the 
      Forkhead box O (FOXO)- Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) axis emerging as a pivotal regulator of 
      cellular stress adaptation, metabolic homeostasis, and longevity. This axis 
      integrates nutrient signaling with oxidative stress defence, modulating glucose 
      and lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, and autophagy to maintain cellular 
      stability. FOXO transcription factors, regulated by SIRT1 deacetylation, enhance 
      antioxidant defence mechanisms, activating genes such as superoxide dismutase 
      (SOD) and catalase, thereby counteracting oxidative stress and metabolic 
      dysregulation. Recent evidence highlights the dynamic role of reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS) as secondary messengers in redox signaling, influencing FOXO-SIRT1 
      activity in metabolic adaptation. Additionally, key redox-sensitive regulators 
      such as nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and Peroxisome 
      proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha) interact with 
      this pathway, orchestrating mitochondrial biogenesis and adaptive stress 
      responses. Pharmacological interventions, including alpha-lipoic acid (ALA), 
      resveratrol, curcumin and NAD(+) precursors, exhibit therapeutic potential by 
      enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing oxidative burden, and restoring metabolic 
      balance. This review synthesizes current advancements in FOXO-SIRT1 regulation, 
      its emerging role in redox homeostasis, and its therapeutic relevance, offering 
      insights into future strategies for combating metabolic dysfunction and 
      aging-related diseases.

TI  - Exploring the therapeutic promise of fisetin: molecular mechanisms and clinical 
      aspects in lung cancer.
LID - 10.1515/jcim-2024-0444 [doi]
AB  - Fisetin, a flavonol belonging to the flavonoid subclass, is a ubiquitous dietary 
      flavonoid present in fruits and vegetables, including fruit peels, and has proven 
      potential for anticancer activity, especially for lung cancer - a leading cause 
      of cancer-related deaths globally. The current paper provides the most detailed 
      and elaborate list of the various roles of fisetin in experimentally induced lung 
      cancer cells, and these roles include the promotion of apoptosis, inhibition of 
      cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the regulation of 
      autophagy. Among the molecular targets, some identified pathways, such as 
      PI3K/Akt, MAPK, and NF-kappaB, that fisetin affects are crucial for tumor formation, 
      so it can be considered a potential chemopreventive agent. Moreover, fisetin 
      improves the effectiveness of conventional treatments as a chemo- and 
      radiosensitizer and minimizes side effects. However, the overall utility of 
      fisetin for clinical use is now somewhat restricted by its poor solubility 
      and short half-life. It is predicted that the future development of 
      nanotechnologies for drug delivery, such as nanoparticle encapsulation, might 
      help solve these difficulties. Further Preclinical and clinical investigations 
      are required to uniformly determine the safety, efficacy, and standard dosage of 
      fisetin for consumption in lung cancer therapy.

TI  - In silico and in vivo evaluation of erucic acid against 
      pentylenetetrazole-induced seizures in mice by modulating oxidative stress, 
      neurotransmitters and neuroinflammation markers.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/1028415X.2025.2463677 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) is a commonly used chemical to induce 
      epileptic seizures in experimental animals. AIM: To investigate the 
      neuroprotective effects of erucic acid against PTZ-induced seizures in mice and 
      explore its underlying mechanisms. METHODOLOGY: The mice were randomly allocated 
      into four groups: normal control, PTZ-treated (35 mg/kg via intraperitoneal 
      injection), and PTZ + erucic acid (at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg). Various 
      parameters were assessed, including the percentage of animals experiencing 
      convulsions, latency to death, percentage of deaths, levels of neurotransmitters, 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 beta 
      (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), 
      oxidative stress marker malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzymes catalase 
      (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reduced glutathione (GSH), and caspase-3. The 
      docking analysis was performed using AutoDock Vina software. RESULTS: Erucic acid 
      markedly reduced the severity and frequency of PTZ-induced seizures, 
      significantly decreased mortality rates, and restored altered neurotransmitter 
      levels in mice. It alleviated oxidative stress by increasing the activity of 
      antioxidant enzymes and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Additionally, 
      erucic acid mitigated neuroinflammation by downregulating pro-inflammatory 
      cytokine production and inhibiting NF-kappaB activation. Molecular docking studies 
      demonstrated that erucic acid exhibited strong binding affinities toward key 
      molecular targets, including GABA (-4.546), NF-kappaB (-5.982), and caspase-3 
      (-5.22), suggesting its potential as a neuroprotective agent. CONCLUSION: Erucic 
      acid may be an effective natural compound in PTZ-induced seizures in mice by 
      restoring neurotransmitters, oxidative stress and neuroinflammatory mediators. It 
      could prove to be a better alternative in the treatment of epilepsy.

AB  - Lung cancer is one of the major cancer-related deaths in the world due to the low 
      success rate in invasive diagnostic procedures and late staging. 
      Hypoxia-associated molecular signatures have received attention due to a growing 
      demand for non-invasive prognostic biomarkers, and miR-210 has been repoured as 
      the only viable candidate. Tumor hypoxia is a characteristic of highly malignant 
      lung cancer, and hypoxia-inducible factors increase miR-210 in this process as a 
      way of allowing cancer cells to inhabit low oxygen conditions and grow further in 
      lung cancer. MiR-210 takes up the responsibility of angiogenesis, survival, and 
      metastasis. Notably, miR-210 is located downstream as a non-invasive diagnostic 
      biomarker because of its stability and measurability in biofluids, including 
      serum and plasma. Existing techniques, which can accurately detect miR-210 
      employing liquid biopsy and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
      reaction (qRT-PCR), provide sensitivity and specificity, making it possible for 
      early detection of hypoxic cancers. In addition to diagnostics, miR-210 is a cure 
      different from other existing treatments as they show lesser efficiency because 
      of hypoxia-resistant genes that may be suppressed by using miR-210. While it 
      holds great promise, such problems as biological variation and the uniformity of 
      the detection techniques may need further research. MiR-210 holds significant 
      possibilities in Lung cancer diagnosis and treatment; however, there is a need 
      for further investigation and confirmation to place miR-210 in the list of 
      biomarkers for customized medicine.

AB  - Recently, increasing interest has been in utilizing mesenchymal stem cell-derived 
      extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs), especially exosomes, as nanocarriers for miRNA 
      delivery in cancer treatment. Due to such characteristics, nanocarriers are 
      specific: biocompatible, low immunogenicity, and capable of spontaneous tumor 
      accumulation. MSC-EVs were loaded with therapeutic miRNAs and minimized their 
      susceptibility to degradation by protecting the miRNA from accessibility to 
      degrading enzymes and providing targeted delivery of the miRNAs to the tumor 
      cells to modulate oncogenic pathways. In vitro and in vivo experiments suggest 
      that MSC-EVs loaded with miRNAs may inhibit tumor growth, prevent metastasis, and 
      increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, these 
      improvements present difficulties such as isolation, scalability, and stability 
      of delivered miRNA during storage. Furthermore, the issues related to off-target 
      effects, as well as immunogenicity, can be a focus. The mechanisms of miRNA 
      loading into MSC-EVs, as well as their targeting efficiency and therapeutic 
      potential, can be outlined in this manuscript. For the final part of the 
      manuscript, the current advances in MSC-EV engineering and potential strategies 
      for clinical application have been described. The findings of MSC-EVs imply that 
      they present MSC-EVs as a second-generation tool for precise oncology.

AB  - The small, non-coding RNAs known as piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) serve 
      essential roles in gene regulation by silencing transposable elements and 
      protecting oncogenes and tumour suppressors. The production of piRNA bioactive 
      forms uses precursor mRNAs, which team with Piwi proteins to support genome 
      maintenance. Accurate leukaemia regulation requires piRNAs because abnormalities 
      in these regulatory elements contribute to disease development and drug 
      resistance progression. Their utility in disease detection appears promising 
      through their distinct pattern expression across different leukaemia subtypes. 
      These piRNA markers promise to enhance early detection of diseases and provide 
      treatment effectiveness and outcome information. Lesions examined by microarrays 
      qRT-PCR and high-throughput sequencing provide professionals with essential tools 
      for studying piRNA profiles and tracking their activities in leukaemia treatment. 
      PiRNAs establish interactions with microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs through 
      complex regulatory networks, contributing to leukaemia development. The 
      therapeutic applications of piRNAs in leukaemia treatment have proven promising, 
      yet additional research is necessary to understand their specific functions and 
      improve standardized detection capability. The field requires future 
      investigations dedicated to designing piRNA-based diagnostic instruments, 
      researching piRNA-derived drug resistance prevention strategies, and optimizing 
      individualized treatment plans for leukaemia patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the genotypic and allelic frequency of SLC19A1 (rs1051296 
      G>T) polymorphism in pre-eclamptic patients and normal pregnant females, and also 
      the genetic association of SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T) polymorphisms with the levels 
      of homocysteine (Hcy) and folate in pre-eclamptic Pakistani population. STUDY 
      DESIGN: A case-control study. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of 
      Biochemistry, Islamic International Medical College, Riphah International 
      University, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from September 2022 to 2023. METHODOLOGY: Gene 
      association of SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T) polymorphism was studied in pre-eclamptic 
      patients to elucidate its clinical significance. The study included 166 
      pre-eclamptic patients and 166 normotensive pregnant females as controls. 
      Maternal venous blood samples were obtained between 20th and 40th weeks of 
      gestation and DNA was extracted using the Chelex method. Allele-specific 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse the SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T) 
      polymorphism. Data were analysed using the Chi-square and Student's t-test. 
      RESULTS: A significant association in terms of susceptibility was found between 
      SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T), CA (p <0.03), and AA (p <0.001) genotype with 
      preeclampsia (PE). A significant association in terms of protection was found 
      between the SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T) CC genotype and PE. Notably, low folic acid 
      along with CA (p <0.05) genotype is a high-risk factor for PE. A prior family 
      history of high blood pressure had not proved any significant association with 
      SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T, p <0.6). CONCLUSION: SLC19A1 (rs1051296 G>T) polymorphism 
      is a risk factor for PE in the Pakistani population. KEY WORDS: Preeclampsia, 
      Blood pressure, Single nucleotide polymorphism, SLC19A1, Polymerase chain 
      reaction.

TI  - Effect of sakuranetin against cyclophosphamide-induced immunodeficiency mice: 
      role of IFN-gamma/TNF-alpha/IgG/IgM/interleukins.
LID - 10.1007/s00210-025-03988-1 [doi]
AB  - Cyclophosphamide is a widely used chemotherapeutic agent known for its 
      effectiveness in treating various cancers; however, it is associated with 
      significant immunosuppressive side effects. This study investigates the potential 
      of sakuranetin, a natural flavonoid, in mice under cyclophosphamide-induced 
      immunosuppressive conditions. Mice were grouped into four groups: one control 
      group, two treated with cyclophosphamide and two sakuranetin-treated groups 
      receiving different doses (10 and 20 mg/kg). Immune organ indices, lymphocyte 
      proliferation, hematological parameters, nitric oxide levels, cytokines (tumor 
      necrosis factor alpha-TNF-alpha, interferon gamma-IFN-gamma), interleukins 
      (interleukin-1beta-IL-1beta, IL-4, IL-6), immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgM levels, 
      plague-forming cells quantification, qualitative hemolysis, and delayed-type 
      hypersensitivity were assessed. Cyclophosphamide significantly (P < 0.05) reduced 
      immune organ indices, lymphocyte proliferation, changes in hematological 
      parameters, and nitric oxide levels. Treatment with both sakuranetin doses 
      restored these parameters and normalized cytokine, IgG, and IgM levels (P < 
      0.05). Sakuranetin significantly (P < 0.05) improved the immunomodulatory action 
      with elevated immune response with downregulation in immune response mediated by 
      cells. Sakuranetin effectively counteracts cyclophosphamide-induced 
      immunosuppression by modulating the IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IgG, and interleukin pathway, 
      suggesting its potential as a protective agent.

      responses. Recent studies on early signaling events following ethylene perception 
      in rice (Oryza sativa) have identified MAO HU ZI 3 (MHZ3) as a stabilizer of the 
      ethylene receptors ETHYLENE RESPONSE SENSOR 2 (OsERS2) and ETHYLENE RECEPTOR 2 
      (OsETR2). MHZ3 ensures the interaction of these receptors with CONSTITUTIVE 
      TRIPLE RESPONSE 2 (OsCTR2), thereby maintaining OsCTR2 activity. Ethylene 
      treatment disrupts the interactions within the MHZ3/receptors/OsCTR2 protein 
      complex, leading to decreased OsCTR2 phosphorylation and the initiation of 
      downstream signaling. Recent studies have established MHZ3 as the primary 
      regulator and switch for OsCTR2 phosphorylation. In this review, we explore the 
      role of MHZ3 in regulating ethylene signaling and highlight its effects on plant 
      growth, development, and stress responses at the plant holobiont level.

AB  - Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a significant public health issue, with 
      diagnosis often complicated by non-specific symptoms and limited access to 
      specialised tools. Early detection is vital for preventing long-term 
      complications. The review examines diagnostic challenges, prognostic factors, 
      management strategies, and future advancements in CO poisoning. It highlights the 
      limitations of current diagnostic techniques such as blood carboxyhaemoglobin 
      levels and pulse CO-oximetry, while exploring emerging methods for rapid 
      detection. Prognosis is influenced by exposure severity and delayed treatment, 
      which increases the risk of neurological damage. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) 
      remains the primary treatment but is not always accessible. Advances in portable 
      CO-oximeters and biomarkers offer potential for improved early diagnosis and 
      monitoring. Addressing resource limitations and refining treatment protocols are 
      crucial for better patient outcomes. Future research should focus on personalised 
      management strategies and the integration of modern technologies to enhance care.

TI  - Evaluating Physiological and Hormonal Responses of Two Distinct Rice Genotypes 
      Under High Temperatures.
LID - 10.3390/plants14050710 [doi]
LID - 710
AB  - Climate change poses a major threat to rice productivity, particularly due to 
      high-temperature stress during anthesis, which severely impacts the grain yield. 
      Understanding the physiological and biochemical responses of different rice 
      genotypes to high-temperature stress is critical for breeding resilient 
      varieties. In this study, we assessed two contrasting rice genotypes, 
      high-temperature-tolerant-1 (HTR-1) and high-temperature-sensitive (HTS-5), to 
      confirm previously established physiological and hormonal mechanisms associated 
      with high-temperature tolerance. The study evaluated morphological, 
      physiological, and biochemical markers at the anthesis stage under control (29/24 
       degrees C) and high-temperature stress (38  degrees C for six hours) conditions. Our results 
      confirmed that HTR-1 exhibits superior tolerance through better antioxidant 
      enzyme activity, higher anther dehiscence, and lower oxidative damage. The 
      genotype HTS-5 exhibited a substantial rise in hydrogen peroxide (1.9-fold) and 
      malondialdehyde (1.74-fold) levels, accompanied by the reduced activity of 
      antioxidant enzymes. Furthermore, the high transcript level of cytosolic APX 
      (OsAPX1, OsAPX2), peroxisomal APX (OsAPX3 and OsAPX4), OsCATA, and OsCATB 
      confirmed high antioxidant activity in HTR-1. Moreover, the GA and IAA levels 
      were reduced in both genotypes, while the ABA concentration was increased 
      significantly in the anthers of HTS-5 as compared to those of HTR-1. This 
      suggests that higher ABA production, along with higher reactive oxygen species 
      (ROS) in the anthers, could lead to sterility in rice under high-temperature 
      scenarios. These findings confirmed HTR-1 as a promising genetic resource for 
      breeding heat-tolerant rice, by validating physiological and biochemical 
      mechanisms of high-temperature resilience. This study also provides practical 
      insights for selecting suitable genotypes to improve rice production under the 
      challenges of climate change.

      aggressive breast cancer.
PG  - 114
LID - 10.1007/s12032-025-02647-y [doi]
AB  - Natural killer cell-derived exosomes (NK-Exos) hold great promise as immune 
      modulators and immunotherapeutics against cancer due to their intrinsically 
      latent anti-tumor effects. They use these nanosized vesicles to deliver cytotoxic 
      molecules, such as perforin, granzymes, and miRNAs, directly to cancer cells to 
      kill them, avoiding immune suppression. NK-Exos has particular efficacy for 
      treating aggressive breast cancer by modulating the TME to activate the immune 
      response and suppress immunosuppressive factors. Bioengineering advances have 
      extended the therapeutic potential of NK-Exos, which permits precise tumor cell 
      targeting and efficient delivery of therapeutic payloads, including small RNAs 
      and chemotherapeutic agents. In engineered NK-Exos, sensitization of cancer cells 
      to apoptosis, reduction of tumor growth, and resistance to drugs have been 
      demonstrated to be highly effective. When combined, NK-Exos synergizes with 
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or checkpoint inhibitors, enhancing therapeutic 
      efficacy, and minimizing systemic toxicity. This review emphasizes the critical 
      role of NK-Exos in breast cancer treatment, their integration into combination 
      therapies, and the need for further research to overcome existing limitations and 
      fully realize their clinical potential.

TI  - Detection of an oxidative stress metabolite associated with neurodegenerative 
      diseases: effect of heteroatom doped antioxidant carbon dots.
PG  - 8354-8366
LID - 10.1039/d5ra00274e [doi]
AB  - Carbon dots (CDs) are neoteric forms of carbon nanostructures, and play a 
      fundamental role in early diagnosis and controlling of neurological disorders 
      (NDs). Aiming towards the detection of an oxidative stress metabolite, the 
      present study provides an innovative strategy for developing heteroatom-doped 
      carbon dots using tamarind as a sustainable carbon source and urea as a nitrogen 
      dopant through a one-step hydrothermal process. This method offers a 
      cost-effective and eco-friendly solution without compromising performance. The 
      structural and functional properties of the synthesized CDs were characterized 
      using advanced techniques, including fluorescence spectroscopy, UV-visible 
      spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and X-ray 
      photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Antioxidant assessments revealed remarkable 
      free-radical scavenging activity (exceeding 80% efficiency) across three 
      independent methodologies. Furthermore, the CDs demonstrated exceptional 
      sensitivity and selectivity in detecting oxidative stress metabolites, 
      particularly 3-nitrotyrosine, with detection efficiency influenced by 
      environmental pH (4.8-8.7). Biocompatibility studies using fibroblast cells 
      confirmed their non-toxic nature, supporting their potential for biomedical 
      applications. Collectively, these findings highlight the promise of 
      heteroatom-doped CDs as a novel platform for detecting oxidative stress 
      metabolites associated with neurodegenerative diseases, bridging fundamental 
      research with real-world diagnostic advancements.

TI  - Unraveling the role of withanolides as key modulators in breast cancer 
      mitigation.

AB  - Addressing the elaborated landscape of therapeutics of global health concern i.e. 
      breast cancer, this comprehensive review explores the promising effects of 
      withanolides, bioactive compounds derived from Withania somnifera, for the 
      treatment of breast cancer. In the breast, random mutations can accumulate over 
      time, eventually transforming it into a tumor cell as certain receptors may be 
      overexpressed by BC cells, which elicits downstream signaling and causes the 
      production of genes involved in angiogenesis, survival, growth and migration, and 
      other critical cell cycle practices. Merging insights from recent studies, our 
      exploration delves into the molecular mechanisms that highlight withanolide's 
      potential in the intervention of breast cancer. The study of apoptotic pathways 
      unveils the withanolide's distinctive as well as pro-apoptotic effects, hinting 
      at its effect as a potent modulator of the progression of breast cancer cells. 
      Beyond its independent potential, there is a discussion on its distinctive 
      perspective over the other therapies. Inweaving together these threads of 
      evidence illuminates channels for future research. This review acts as a guide 
      for researchers and clinicians negotiating the challenges of incorporating 
      withanolides into the changing landscape for the treatment of breast cancer by 
      balancing optimism with perceptive interpretation.

TI  - Assessing the link between skin Aquaporins and morphological attributes under 
      simulated heat stress conditions: A comparative investigation between hair and 
      wool sheep breeds.

AB  - A comprehensive understanding of the functions of Aquaporins (AQPs) is 
      indispensable for elucidating physiological adjustments to varied habitats and 
      addressing water balance complexities amid environmental fluctuations. This 
      experiment endeavors to investigate the relationship between cutaneous AQPs and 
      morphological traits in two sheep breeds with differing haircoat textures, the 
      Naimi and Najdi, under simulated heat stress conditions. Ten male lambs from each 
      breed were housed individually in controlled environments and subjected to cyclic 
      heat stress mimicking summer conditions for six weeks. Sweating rates (SR) were 
      measured biweekly, and skin and coat samples were collected for analysis in the 
      final week. Additionally, the mRNA expression levels of Aquaporin 1 (AQP1), 
      Aquaporin 3 (AQP3), and Aquaporin 5 (AQP5) in skin tissue were assessed. Results 
      showed a (P < 0.05) increase in skin AQPs gene expression following thermal 
      exposure in both breeds, accompanied by elevated SR. However, the Naimi breed 
      exhibited (P < 0.05) higher AQP1 expression levels, correlating with differences 
      in their skin depth, coat thickness, and fleece density compared to the Najdi 
      breed, which showed (P < 0.05) heightened AQP5 expression, consistent with their 
      thicker hair diameter. Both breeds displayed similar upregulation of AQP3, 
      suggesting its equivalent role in facilitating perspiration during heat stress. 
      In conclusion, this experiment represents one of the initial inquiries into the 
      presence of AQPs genes within the dermal layers of sheep. The involvement of both 
      skin AQPs and sweating response might emphasizes the intricate interplay between 
      their physical attributes and genetic predispositions in coping with heat stress, 
      indicating a multifaceted process of thermoregulation in sheep. The obtained 
      findings underscore the role of AQPs in helping sheep breeds with distinct coat 
      textures adapt to environmental challenges and maintain water balance, and thus 
      might support targeted breeding strategies for enhanced heat tolerance in arid 
      environments.

TI  - The role of VEGF in vascular dementia: impact of aging and cellular senescence.
PG  - 77
LID - 10.1007/s10522-025-10219-w [doi]
AB  - Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a critical element in vascular 
      dementia (VD) pathogenesis and therapeutic development while remaining strongly 
      influenced by aging processes and cellular aging mechanisms. VEGF's multiple 
      effects comprise neuroprotective functions, its role in vascular development, and 
      its ability to regulate brain blood flow systems, all leading to cognitive 
      preservation. The prefrontal cortex exhibits elevated VEGF gene levels, which 
      directly matches the advancement of cognitive deficits in patients with 
      Alzheimer's disease and VD. These patients exhibit higher VEGF levels in their 
      CSF fluid, demonstrating that disease pathology includes multiple inseparable 
      factors. Aging dramatically worsens VEGF regulation because endothelial 
      dysfunction combines with chronic inflammation and oxidative stress to generate 
      adverse vascular symptoms that include atherosclerosis and stroke. Cellular 
      senescence convolutes these processes by causing damaging inflammatory reactions 
      alongside impaired vascular healing abilities. The secretion of pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines from senescent cells (SCs) disrupts VEGF signaling and produces harmful 
      consequences for both vascular health and cognitive well-being. The 
      neuroprotective properties of VEGF-A165a and VEGF-A165b variants demonstrate 
      their ability to lessen beta-amyloid and tau protein toxicity. The protective 
      mechanisms of VEGF depend heavily on VEGF expression levels and receptor 
      functionality, both of which decrease with aging. The combination of approaches 
      that modulate VEGF signaling and SC accumulation shows potential for designing 
      treatments against VD. People can sustain BBB functionality over a longer period 
      through Mediterranean diet consumption together with aerobic exercise along with 
      developing therapies, including senolytics and senomorphics, which delay 
      neurodegenerative progression. Future investigative efforts must improve VEGF 
      delivery methods while studying cellular senescence mechanisms and developing 
      advanced methods to detect SC cells. A three-dimensional healthcare approach 
      combining VEGF-targeted treatments with anti-ageing interventions and detailed 
      diagnostic techniques shows the potential for effective VD management to achieve 
      better patient results.

AB  - The role of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) in the pathogenesis of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical for linking amyloid-beta (Abeta) and Tau 
      pathology. The activity of GSK-3beta is dysregulated in the regulation of Tau 
      hyperphosphorylation, formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and production 
      of Abeta by modulating amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. This review 
      discusses the mechanisms controlling GSK-3beta dysregulation in aging and its 
      influence on AD progression, focusing on the role of neuroinflammation, oxidative 
      stress, and defective signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt and Wnt. Critical 
      analysis is presented for therapeutic strategies targeting GSK-3beta using natural 
      compounds (e.g., curcumin, geniposide) and emerging approaches such as TREM2 
      modulation and miRNA therapies. In preclinical models, these interventions 
      promise to reduce Tau hyperphosphorylation and Abeta burden, along with associated 
      neurodegeneration. Nevertheless, achieving selective GSK-3beta inhibition and 
      optimizing drug delivery are still critical barriers to clinical translation. 
      This review underscores the central role of GSK-3beta in AD pathogenesis to 
      highlight its potential as a multifaceted therapeutic target of an innovative 
      strategy for treating this complex neurodegenerative disease.

TI  - Pilot Study on the Effect of Cannabidiol-Coated Fabric for Pillow Covers Improves 
      the Sleep Quality of Shift Nurses.

AB  - Background: Sleep difficulty is common in the current society. Poor sleep has a 
      significant influence on health, social interactions and even mortality; 
      therefore, maintaining good sleep is of prime importance. Cannabidiol (CBD), a 
      cannabis-derived compound, is known for its medical significance with many 
      positive effects in humans, including decreasing anxiety and improving sleep for 
      those with sleep disorders. Objective: However, whether CBD skin absorption 
      results in similar effects is unknown. Therefore, examining CBD-coated fabric as 
      a pillow cover to improve sleep quality in duty shift nurses is the purpose of 
      this paper. Methods: This study recruited 55 duty shift nurses as participants to 
      evaluate sleep patterns and quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
      (PSQI) and a consumer-grade tracker (Fitbit Charge 3). Data were collected over 
      three phases: a one-week baseline period, a two-week intervention period using a 
      CBD-coated pillow cover and a one-week follow-up period, referred to as the 
      post-intervention phase, during which the use of CBD-coated pillow cover was 
      continued. Results: Of the 55 participants, 10 were men (18.2%) and 45 were women 
      (81.8%). At baseline, all participants exhibited poor sleep quality (PSQI >/= 5). 
      However, after three weeks of using CBD-coated pillow covers, subjective sleep 
      quality significantly improved, with 7.3% of participants achieving PSQI scores 
      <5. Additionally, slight changes in sleep patterns were observed, with increases 
      in both light sleep and deep sleep durations. Light sleep duration increased from 
      a baseline of 196.21 +/- 65.28 to 206.57 +/- 59.15 min two weeks after intervention 
      (p = 0.337). Similarly, deep sleep duration showed a modest increase from 61.97 +/- 
      21.01 min to 64.35 +/- 22.19 min (p = 0.288). Furthermore, a significant reduction 
      in anxiety levels was reported (p < 0.005). Conclusions: Using a CBD-coated 
      pillow cover was found to enhance sleep duration in healthy individuals 
      experiencing poor sleep. Consequently, for adults struggling with sleep 
      difficulties, incorporating a CBD-coated pillow cover may serve as an effective 
      aid in improving sleep quality.

TI  - Parthanatos and apoptosis: unraveling their roles in cancer cell death and 
      therapy resistance.
PG  - 351-380
LID - 10.17179/excli2025-8251 [doi]
AB  - Cell death is a fundamental process that needs to be maintained to balance 
      cellular functions and prevent disease. There are several cell death pathways; 
      however, apoptosis and parthanatos are the most prominent and have important 
      roles in cancer biology. As an extremely well-regulated process, apoptosis 
      removes damaged or abnormal cells via caspase activation and mitochondrial 
      involvement. Unlike in the healthy cells, the loss of ability to induce apoptosis 
      in cancer permits tumor cells to survive and multiply out of control and 
      contribute to tumor progression and therapy resistance. On the contrary, 
      parthanatos is a caspase-independent metabolic collapse driven by poly 
      (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) overactivation, translocation of 
      apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and complete DNA damage. Several cancer models 
      are involved with parthanatos. Deoxypodophyllotoxin (DPT) induces parthanatos in 
      glioma cells by excessive ROS generation, PARP1 upregulation, and AIF nuclear 
      translocation. Like in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the cannabinoid derivative 
      WIN-55 triggers parthanatos, and the effects can be reversed by PARP inhibitors 
      such as olaparib. Developing cancer treatment strategies involving advanced 
      cancer treatment strategies relies on the interplay between apoptosis and 
      parthanatos. However, such apoptosis-based cancer therapies tend to develop 
      resistance, so there is an urgent need to look into alternative pathways like 
      parthanatos, which may not always trigger apoptosis. In overcoming apoptosis 
      resistance, there is evidence that combining apoptosis-inducing agents, such as 
      BH3 mimetics, with PARP inhibitors synergistically enhances cell death. Oxidative 
      stress modulators have been found to promote the execution of parthanatic and 
      apoptotic pathways and allow treatment. In this review, apoptosis and parthanatos 
      are thoroughly compared at the molecular level, and their roles in cancer 
      pathogenesis as related to cancer therapeutic potential are discussed. We 
      incorporate recent findings to demonstrate that not only can parthanatos be used 
      to manage therapy resistance and enhance cancer treatment via the combination of 
      parthanatos and apoptosis but also that immunity and bone deposition can feasibly 
      be employed against long-circulating cancer stem cells to treat diverse forms of 
      metastatic cancers.

TI  - Exploring superior nonlinear optical properties of copper complexes with 
      pi-conjugated ligands: experimental and theoretical investigation.
PG  - 4657-4668
LID - 10.1039/d4ra08037h [doi]
AB  - This study explores the nonlinear optical (NLO) properties of two synthesized 
      copper complexes, [Cu(dmp)(2)(H(2)O)].(PA)(2) (complex 1) and 
      [Cu(dmp)(2)].(PA) (complex 2), where dmp represents 
      2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (neocuproine) and PA refers to picric acid. 
      Employing both experimental and theoretical approaches, we comprehensively 
      analyzed their NLO properties. Experimentally, third-order NLO parameters were 
      determined using the Z-scan technique with a 520 nm continuous-wave diode laser, 
      yielding values of nonlinear refractive index (n (2)), nonlinear absorption 
      coefficient (beta), and third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility (chi ((3))) on 
      the order of 10(-7) cm(2) W(-1), 10(-3) cm W(-1), and 10(-6) esu, respectively. 
      These findings underscore their significant optical nonlinearity and suitability 
      for intensity-dependent NLO applications, as evidenced by their high values of 
      negative refractive index. Density Functional Theory (DFT) investigations were 
      performed at the M062X/(6-31G(d,p)/LanL2DZ)) level to evaluate key reactivity 
      descriptors, including polarizability, hyperpolarizability, and dipole moment, 
      which align with the experimental results. Conceptual DFT analysis reveals that 
      complex 1 is more stable, while complex 2 exhibits higher reactivity. The strong 
      hyperpolarizability and remarkable third-order NLO properties of these copper 
      complexes demonstrate their potential for advanced photonic and optoelectronic 
      applications.

TI  - Silicon seed inoculation enhances antioxidants, physiology and yield of hybrid 
      maize under heat stress.
PG  - 417

AB  - BACKGROUND: Heat stress, next to drought, is one of the major constraints to 
      maize crop growth, development and sustainable yield in the tropics and 
      sub-tropics, particularly in arid and semi-arid climatic regions. Hence, there is 
      a dire need to explore strategies that alleviate adverse effects of heat stress. 
      In this regard, silicon (Si) is an important plant nutrient which may support 
      crop in alleviating heat stress-induced damages by modulating plant defense 
      mechanisms. The aim of the study was to explore the potential role of Si for 
      inducing heat tolerance in hybrid maize. Yet, to date, limited knowledge is 
      available on how Si modulates plant defense mechanisms to induce heat tolerance 
      in maize crop. METHODS: Two maize hybrids were adopted for field experiment (heat 
      tolerant and sensitive selected from a pot experiment study) on the basis of 
      traits performance through screening in the glasshouse. Six maize hybrids were 
      tested at different heat stress levels (T(1) = control; T(2) = 40  degrees C +/- 3 and 
      T(3) = 45  degrees C +/- 3 for a period of 6 h per day) at six leaf growth stage (V6) in 
      the glasshouse. Secondly, a field experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect 
      of Si seed inoculation [Si(0) = 0.0 mM (control); Si(1) = 3.0 mM (recommended); 
      Si(2) = 6.0 mM] on physiology, growth, antioxidants activity and yield traits of 
      two selected maize hybrids; H(1) = AA-9633 (heat sensitive); H(2) = YH-5427 (heat 
      tolerant) under heat stress conditions (HS(0) = control (without heat stress); 
      HS(1) = heat stress at pollination stage- 65 days after sowing for a period of 8 
      consecutive days). RESULTS: The field study results showed that maize hybrid 
      "YH-5427", a prior rated as heat tolerant, produced higher cob length, number of 
      grains per cob, thousand grain weight and grain yield through improved 
      photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency, activity of 
      superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase with the seed inoculation of Si 
      (6.0 mM) under heat stress conditions. However, heat sensitive hybrid (AA-9633) 
      produced reduced grain yield (9.26%) and yield components as attained by YH-5427 
      with the seed inoculation of Si (6.0 mM) under heat stress conditions. 
      CONCLUSION: Maize hybrid YH-5427 with Si seed inoculation (6 mM) is a promising 
      option to maintain relatively high maize grain yield (t ha(- 1)) under heat 
      stress conditions.

TI  - Evaluating anti-CHIK IgM and qualitative RT-PCR for diagnosing Chikungunya in 
      hospitalized patients: A comparative analysis of diagnostic efficacy.
LID - 10.4103/JVBD.JVBD_125_24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND OBJECTIVES: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an alphavirus characterized 
      by a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome, and it is transmitted primarily 
      by Aedes mosquitoes. Prompt and precise diagnosis is essential for efficient 
      clinical treatment, monitoring, and public health initiatives aimed at 
      controlling CHIKV spread. Diagnostic methods include reverse 
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and serological assays, with 
      lateral flow chromatographic immunoassays frequently used to detect IgM 
      antibodies. The aim of this study is to compare the RT-PCR and chikungunya IgM 
      antibody detection Methods. METHODS: A diagnostic comparative study was conducted 
      within the Pathology department at Aarogyam Hospital in Roorkee, Uttarakhand. In 
      this study, two types of diagnostic methods were employed. Blood samples were 
      obtained for the lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay IgM Combo Rapid test 
      and the Chikungunya RT-PCR. Statistical data analysis was conducted by using 
      GraphPad and MS Excel 2010. RESULTS: The study included 50 suspected chikungunya 
      patients. The mean age of participants was 35.6+/-6.627 (mean+/-SD) within 7-75 yrs 
      age groups. There were 26 men and 24 women among the participants. Out of the 50 
      patients, 27 were identified as chikungunya positive. INTERPRETATION CONCLUSION: 
      The study reveals the complimentary nature of RT-PCR and IgM chromatographic 
      methods in the diagnosis of Chikungunya. While RT-PCR is excellent for confirming 
      current infections, IgM chromatographic methods provide important information on 
      the immune response.

TI  - Does anticoagulation therapy improve outcomes in severe heart failure with 
      reduced ejection fraction? A systematic review: Anticoagulation in severe heart 
      failure: a systematic review.
PG  - 1576-1582
LID - 10.1097/MS9.0000000000002966 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a growing 
      health concern, with an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Oral 
      anticoagulants (OACs) are commonly used in HFrEF patients with atrial 
      fibrillation, but their role in patients with sinus rhythm is unclear. OBJECTIVE: 
      To assess the safety and efficacy of OACs in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm. 
      METHODS: A systematic review of seven studies involving 17 051 patients was 
      conducted. Outcomes included mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), 
      nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization rates. RESULTS: OACs significantly reduced 
      non-fatal strokes compared to antiplatelets and placebo. A measurable reduction 
      in nonfatal MIs was observed in most studies. However, no conclusive benefit was 
      found regarding all-cause fatality and rehospitalization rates. The benefit of 
      OACs in stroke prevention was counterbalanced by an increased risk of major 
      bleeding episodes. CONCLUSION: OACs may have a role in reducing nonfatal 
      cardiovascular events in HFrEF patients with sinus rhythm, particularly those 
      with ischemic etiologies or underlying thrombotic states. However, further 
      research is needed to establish their efficacy and safety in this population.

      while avoiding overload during pregnancy.
PG  - 1476672

LID - 1476672
AB  - Pregnancy is a period characterized by extensive physiological changes in both 
      the mother and fetus. During this period, the nutritional status of the mother 
      has a profound and irreversible impact on her health and the growth and 
      development of the fetus. The fetus depends exclusively on the mother and drives 
      nutrients through the placenta. Therefore, mothers must be provided with a 
      well-balanced diet that is adequate in both macro- and micronutrients. Most 
      pregnant women generally manage to get adequate macronutrients; however, many 
      women fail to get micronutrients up to the recommended dietary allowance. 
      Micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals are necessary for preventing 
      congenital abnormalities and the optimal development of the brain and body of the 
      fetus. Their inadequacy can lead to complications like anemia, hypertension, 
      pre-eclampsia, maternal and fetal hypothyroidism, premature infants, intrauterine 
      growth restriction, stillbirth, and other negative pregnancy outcomes. New 
      studies recommend the use of prenatal micronutrient supplements to prevent birth 
      defects and health issues caused by deficiencies in folic acid, iron, iodine, and 
      calcium during pregnancy. This is especially important in developing nations 
      where deficiencies are prevalent. Also while using these supplements, their upper 
      limits (UL) must be considered to avoid overload. In this review, we provide an 
      overview of the four most critical micronutrients during pregnancy: iron, folic 
      acid, iodine, and calcium. We provide insight into their sources, RDAs, 
      deficiency consequences, and the need for supplementation while considering the 
      risk of micronutrient overload. To maximize the potential benefits while 
      minimizing the risk of nutrient overload, although knowledge gaps remain.

      cancer therapy resistance.
PG  - 303-318
LID - 10.1016/j.reth.2025.03.006 [doi]
AB  - Cancer remains a prominent worldwide health concern, presenting existing 
      therapies with frequent difficulties, including major toxicity, limited 
      effectiveness, and treatment resistance emergence. These issues highlight the 
      necessity for novel and enhanced remedies. Exosomes, tiny extracellular vesicles 
      that facilitate intercellular communication, have attracted interest for their 
      potential medicinal applications. Carrying a variety of molecules, including 
      microRNAs, small interfering RNAs, long non-coding RNAs, proteins, lipids, and 
      DNA, these vesicles are positioned as promising cancer treatment options. Current 
      studies have increasingly investigated the capacity of microRNAs as a strategic 
      approach for combating malignancy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are recognized 
      for their aptitude to augment blood vessel formation, safeguard against cellular 
      death, and modulate immune responses. Consequently, researchers examine exosomes 
      derived from MSCs as a safer, non-cellular choice over therapies employing MSCs, 
      which risk undesirable differentiation. The focus is shifting towards employing 
      miRNA-encapsulated exosomes sourced from MSCs to target and heal cancerous cells 
      selectively. However, the exact functions of miRNAs within MSC-derived exosomes 
      in the context of cancer are still not fully understood. Additional exploration 
      is necessary to clarify the role of these miRNAs in malignancy progression and to 
      pinpoint viable therapeutic targets. This review offers a comprehensive 
      examination of exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells, focusing on the 
      encapsulation of miRNAs, methods for enhancing cellular uptake and stability, and 
      their potential applications in cancer treatment. It also addresses the 
      difficulties linked to this methodology and considers future avenues, including 
      insights from current clinical oncology research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hydrogels loaded with antibiotics can be an effective drug delivery 
      systemfor treating skin diseases or conditions such asinburns and wound healing. 
      OBJECTIVES: The current research work was planned to preparea hydrogel dressing 
      for an effective wound healing. The hydrogel formulation was aimed to provide 
      sustained drug release, reducing the frequency of repeated applying the 
      transdermal drug formulation or patch. METHODS: Different polymers, polyvinyl 
      alcohol, sodium alginate, and polyvinyl pyrrolidonein varying ratios were used to 
      prepare hydrogels by freeze-thawing method. The prepared hydrogel formulations 
      were loaded with framycetinsulphate (FC-S), a topical aminoglycoside. RESULTS: 
      Swelling behaviour, drug release pattern, wereinvestigated.Equilibrium and 
      dynamic studies were conducted at pH 7.4. The prepared hydrogel formulations 
      showed Euilibriumswellingratio of 197.5%. The in-vitro release pattern of 
      FC-Shydrogels was determined by dissolution testing. The prepared hydrogels were 
      characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)andfourier transform infrared 
      (FTIR)spectroscopy.Animal study was conducted on rats to evaluatethe in-vivo 
      therapeutic effectiveness of FC-S hydrogels in wound healing. For that 
      purpose,wounds were induced in the animals. The drug loaded hydrogel dressing was 
      effiecent in wound heaing as the wound treated with FC-S loaded hydrogel was 
      almost completely healed (97%) on the fifth day in comparison to commercially 
      available product (Sofra Tulle gauze) that healed 86%, whereas free FC-S 
      manifested healing at 76%. CONCLUSION: It was observed that hydrogel dressing 
      loaded with FC-S was therapeutically more efficient and can be used as a 
      potential candidate for wound healing.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Encoder-only transformer-based language models have shown promise in 
      automating critical appraisal of clinical literature. However, a comprehensive 
      evaluation of the models for classifying the methodological rigor of randomized 
      controlled trials is necessary to identify the more robust ones. This study 
      benchmarks several state-of-the-art transformer-based language models using a 
      diverse set of performance metrics. METHODS: Seven transformer-based language 
      models were fine-tuned on the title and abstract of 42,575 articles from 2003 to 
      2023 in McMaster University's Premium LiteratUre Service database under different 
      configurations. The studies reported in the articles addressed questions related 
      to treatment, prevention, or quality improvement for which randomized controlled 
      trials are the gold standard with defined criteria for rigorous methods. Models 
      were evaluated on the validation set using 12 schemes and metrics, including 
      optimization for cross-entropy loss, Brier score, AUROC, average precision, 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, among others. Threshold tuning was 
      performed to optimize threshold-dependent metrics. Models that achieved the best 
      performance in one or more schemes on the validation set were further tested in 
      hold-out and external datasets. RESULTS: A total of 210 models were fine-tuned. 
      Six models achieved top performance in one or more evaluation schemes. Three 
      BioLinkBERT models outperformed others on 8 of the 12 schemes. BioBERT, 
      BiomedBERT, and SciBERT were best on 1, 1 and 2 schemes, respectively. While 
      model performance remained robust on the hold-out test set, it declined in 
      external datasets. Class weight adjustments improved performance in most 
      instances. CONCLUSION: BioLinkBERT generally outperformed the other models. Using 
      comprehensive evaluation metrics and threshold tuning optimizes model selection 
      for real-world applications. Future work should assess generalizability to other 
      datasets, explore alternate imbalance strategies, and examine training on 
      full-text articles.

TI  - Targeting p53-p21 signaling to enhance mesenchymal stem cell regenerative 
      potential.
PG  - 352-363
LID - 10.1016/j.reth.2025.03.007 [doi]
AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are properties of self-renewal and differentiation 
      potentials and thus are very appealing to regenerative medicine. Nevertheless, 
      their therapeutic potential is frequently constrained by senescence, limited 
      proliferation, and stress-induced apoptosis. The key role of the p53-p21 biology 
      in MSC biology resides in safeguarding genomic stability while promoting 
      senescence and limiting regenerative capacity upon over-activation demonstrated. 
      This pathway is a key point for improving MSC function and exploiting the 
      inherent limitations. Recent advances indicate that senescence can be delayed by 
      targeting the p53-p21 signaling and improved MSC proliferation and 
      differentiation capacity. PFT-alpha pharmacological agents transiently inhibit p53 
      from increasing proliferation and lineage-specific differentiation, while 
      antioxidants such as hydrogen-rich saline and epigallocatechin 3 gallate (EGCG) 
      suppress oxidative stress and attenuate p53 p21 signaling. Genetic tools like 
      CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference also precisely modulate TP53 and CDKN1A 
      expression to optimize MSC functionality. The interplay of p53-p21 with pathways 
      like Wnt/beta-catenin and MAPK further highlights opportunities for combinatorial 
      therapies to enhance MSC resilience and regenerative outcomes. This review aims 
      to offer a holistic view of how p53-p21 targeting can further the regenerative 
      potential of MSCs, resolving senescence, proliferation, and stress resilience 
      towards advanced therapeutics built on MSCs.

      senescence.
PG  - 94
LID - 10.1007/s10522-025-10229-8 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac aging is a multistep process that results in a loss of various structural 
      and functional heart abilities, increasing the risk of heart disease. Since its 
      remarkable discovery in the early 1800s, when limestone is heated, calcium's 
      importance has been defined in numerous ways. It can help stiffen shells and 
      bones, function as a reducing agent in chemical reactions, and play a central 
      role in cellular signalling. The movement of calcium ions in and out of cells and 
      between those is referred to as calcium signalling. It influences the binding of 
      the ligand, enzyme activity, electrochemical gradients, and other cellular 
      processes. Calcium signalling is critical for both contraction and relaxation 
      under the sliding filament model of heart muscle. However, with age, the heart 
      undergoes changes that lead to increases in cardiac dysfunction, such as 
      myocardial fibrosis, decreased cardiomyocyte function, and noxious disturbances 
      in calcium homeostasis. Additionally, when cardiac tissues age, cellular 
      senescence, a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, accumulates and begins to 
      exacerbate tissue inflammation and fibrosis. This review explores the most recent 
      discoveries regarding the role of senescent cell accumulation and calcium 
      signalling perturbances in cardiac aging. Additionally, new treatment strategies 
      are used to reduce aged-related heart dysfunction by targeting senescent cells 
      and modulating calcium homeostasis.

TI  - Photo-assisted synthesis of protonated oxides for fuel cells.
PG  - 120
LID - 10.1038/s42004-025-01488-0 [doi]
LID - 120
AB  - The absence of intrinsic protons in proton-conducting oxides (PCO) is a 
      significant challenge that limits the proton conductivity of proton-conducting 
      perovskites, such as Y-doped BaMO(3) (M = Zr, Ce), in proton ceramic fuel cells 
      exhibit low conductivity (10(-3) to 10(-2) S cm(-1) at 600  degrees C). Herein, we 
      introduce a photo-assisted synthesis method for incorporating protons into 
      Al-doped ceria (Al(x)Ce(1-x)O(2-delta), x = 0.2; M-ACO), leveraging the open cubic 
      fluorite structure and photo-activated radical reactions. Specifically, 
      photon-generated hydroxyl reactive (OH∙) and superoxide ( O2∙- ) Radicals are 
      generated and interact with the ACO crystal lattice, facilitating proton 
      incorporation and resulting in the synthesis of native-proton-type PCO. This 
      process results in a protonated (H-ACO) with a high proton conductivity of 0.14 S 
      cm(-1) and exceptional power density of 922 mW cm(-2) at 500  degrees C. This versatile 
      synthesis methodology offers broader development of advanced PCO for 
      energy-related applications.

TI  - Role of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha as Potential Biomarkers in Ischemic Heart Disease: 
      A Comparative Study of Patients with CAD and Non-CAD.
LID - 10.3390/medsci13020040 [doi]
LID - 40
AB  - Background: Ischemic heart disease (CAD), a leading global health burden, arises 
      primarily from atherosclerosis, an inflammatory condition characterized by lipid 
      accumulation and metabolic dysregulation. The precise contribution of 
      inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha) to CAD pathogenesis remains an 
      area of significant research. Aim: The primary aim of this study is to examine 
      the IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and 
      compare them with Non-CAD individuals to evaluate their potential as diagnostic 
      biomarkers for CAD. Methodology: A prospective observational study was conducted 
      over 3 years, involving 100 participants divided into CAD and non-CAD groups. 
      Blood samples were isolated and analyzed for IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels 
      utilizing ELISA kits. Biochemical parameters, including lipid profiles, were also 
      assessed. Results: This study observed significantly elevated IL-6 in patients 
      with CAD compared with controls, while IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels did not reach 
      statistical significance. The CAD group exhibited dyslipidemia characterized by 
      elevated triglycerides and reduced HDL. Furthermore, the CAD group demonstrated 
      alterations in biochemical parameters, including lower albumin and calcium 
      levels, higher urea and uric acid levels, and an elevated erythrocyte 
      sedimentation rate. These findings suggest a systemic inflammatory state and 
      metabolic disturbances in patients with CAD. Conclusions: This study highlights 
      IL-6 as a potential biomarker and key player in CAD pathogenesis. These findings 
      warrant further investigation into the therapeutic potential of targeting 
      inflammatory pathways for cardiovascular risk reduction.

LID - e0320307
AB  - This study introduces a method for analyzing the propagation of electromagnetic 
      waves in cylindrical structures with central chambers facilitating beam-plasma 
      interactions, particularly relevant for slow-wave structures in backward wave 
      oscillators. The boundary value problem, governed by the Helmholtz equation, is 
      resolved using the mode-matching technique, yielding an exact solution. The 
      analysis elucidates key phenomena, including reflection, transmission, 
      orthogonality relations, and power flux variations with frequency and material 
      properties. By examining the effects of plasma frequency and beam radius on phase 
      velocity, group velocity, and interaction efficiency, the study provides insights 
      into optimizing wave propagation and energy transfer. The results demonstrate 
      that higher plasma frequencies and reduced beam radii enhance scattering 
      characteristics, offering practical guidance for designing efficient 
      electromagnetic devices.

TI  - Synthesis, Microbiology, and Biophysical Characterization of Mutanofactins from 
      the Human Oral Microbiome.
PG  - 601-611
LID - 10.1021/acscentsci.4c02184 [doi]
AB  - Mutanofactins are a family of natural products produced by Streptococcus mutans 
      from the human oral microbiome. We report a unified approach to all mutanofactins 
      by developing a total synthesis amenable to diversification. The key to success 
      for the most complex members, mutanofactins 607 and 697, was an acyl ketene based 
      strategy. Access to the family enabled comprehensive biological profiling, where 
      we demonstrate that all mutanofactins are biofilm promoting in Streptococcus 
      mutans. Experiments were extended to other inhabitants of the oral microbiome for 
      the first time: Streptococcus gordonii and Streptococcus oralis, two early 
      colonizers, were similarly affected with mutanofactins being biofilm promoting. 
      Conversely, Veillonella dispar and Fusobacterium nucleatum showed little to no 
      reaction to mutanofactins. Biophysical investigations based on quartz crystal 
      microbalance with dissipation monitoring and atomic force microscopy reveal a 
      previously unknown mucin-mutanofactin 697 interaction. Incubation of a mucin 
      layer with mutanofactin 697 induces a morphology change within the mucin layer, 
      which promotes bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. This unique property of 
      mutanofactin 697 might be key to early stages of biofilm formation in the human 
      oral microbiome. Combined, an interdisciplinary approach consisting of total 
      synthesis, microbiology and biophysical characterization provides insight into 
      the roles of mutanofactins in the oral microbiome.

TI  - ATM and p53 in aging and cancer: a double-edged sword in genomic integrity.
PG  - 102
LID - 10.1007/s10522-025-10249-4 [doi]
AB  - Maintaining genomic stability is essential for detecting DNA damage and 
      activating appropriate responses such as repair, apoptosis, or senescence, 
      primarily mediated by the ATM-p53 axis. ATM is the main sensor of double-strand 
      breaks, and once activated, it will either promote the repair of damaged DNA or 
      eliminate the damaged cells through apoptosis. ATM and p53 mutations upset this 
      equilibrium to cause genomic instability, therapy resistance, and tumor 
      progression in the context of cancer. Oncogene-induced senescence is bypassed by 
      ATM inactivation, which allows cells to progress to become tumors, and p53 
      mutations allow for uncontrolled proliferation and sensitivity to apoptosis. In 
      addition, persistent ATM signaling can trigger a SASP, which paradoxically 
      further enhances an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and contributes to 
      aging-related diseases and cancer progression. Chemical small molecule p53 
      activators (PRIMA-1, Nutlin-3) and ATM inhibitors (AZD0156, M4076) sensitize 
      cancer to DNA damaging therapy in cells and nude mice without p53. It remains to 
      be seen whether ATM loss results in ATM/p53 signaling that is always detrimental 
      to tumor proliferation or has context-dependent effects since ATM loss can also 
      promote p53-dependent tumor suppression through senescence and apoptosis in 
      specific cancer types. In this review, we consolidate state-of-the-art findings 
      on ATM and p53 coordination in the processes involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, 
      and senescence to show how ATM and p53 dual involvement in tumor suppression and 
      cancer progression is occurring. It also focuses on therapeutic approaches 
      targeting these pathways to benefit from senescence and intimidating cancer 
      treatment outcomes.

TI  - Validation of the FASILA Score for Predicting Interventions and Outcomes in 
      Traumatic Abdominal and Pelvic Injuries: A Prospective Clinical Study.
PG  - 1951-1959
LID - 10.1002/wjs.12632 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The FASILA score is a 7-point scale comprising the FAST (focused 
      assessment with sonography in trauma), shock index, and serum lactate. We aimed 
      to validate this score prospectively in patients with abdominal and pelvic trauma 
      to predict the need for massive blood transfusion, laparotomy, and inhospital 
      mortality. METHODS: This prospective study included all adult patients who 
      sustained abdominal and/or pelvic trauma. Pediatric patients, prehospital cardiac 
      arrest, and severe head injury were excluded. Data were analyzed and compared 
      with low (< 4) versus high (>/= 4) FASILA scores. RESULTS: A total of 400 patients 
      (mean age 36.3 +/- 12.7; 90% male; and 96% had blunt trauma) were enrolled between 
      2022 and 2024. Patients with higher FASILA scores (19.3%) had higher rates of 
      exploratory laparotomy and radiological interventions and received more blood 
      transfusions. They also had longer hospital stays, higher rates of sepsis, and 
      mortality (p = 0.001). The FASILA scores significantly correlated with shock 
      index (r = 0.75), ISS (r = 0.38), SOFA score (r = 0.36), and abdominal AIS 
      (r = 0.27), TRISS (r = -0.19), RTS (r = -0.26), and fibrinogen levels 
      (r = -0.12). A FASILA score >/= 4 had a high specificity (85.5%) and negative 
      predictive value (80%) for predicting the need for surgery. The FASILA score was 
      an independent predictor of blood transfusion (odds ratio 1.92 and 95% CI 
      1.43-2.58) after adjusting for abdominal AIS, ISS, SOFA score, and fibrinogen 
      level. AUROC curves were better for the FASILA score than ABC score and "SI 
      alone" for the prediction of MTP and surgical interventions. CONCLUSION: The 
      significant association between high FASILA scores and blood transfusions, 
      surgical interventions, and mortality indicates its usefulness in early risk 
      stratification in abdominopelvic trauma. Multicenter studies are recommended to 
      enhance external validity across diverse populations and settings.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in the Clinic: Creating Harmony or Just Adding Noise?
PG  - e481490
LID - 10.1200/EDBK-25-481490 [doi]
AB  - Although still limited, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in health 
      care has rapidly expanded in the past few years, especially in oncology clinics. 
      In this article, AI refers to the development and implementation of computer 
      systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, 
      such as language understanding, learning, and reasoning. AI technology is 
      currently being used as ambient listening technology (AI-driven systems that 
      passively capture verbal interactions between patients and health care 
      providers), patient messaging chatbots (AI-enabled conversational agents designed 
      to interact with patients by text or voice platforms), and as tools for inbox 
      management and patient care delivery. However, the question remains: Is AI truly 
      fostering harmony in health care, or just adding noise to an already complex 
      system? Although the current applications of this technology have shown promising 
      results in affecting routine care provided by physicians, this article will focus 
      on AI's broader impact on the health care system-highlighting how ambient 
      listening technology can improve the clinical experience for both patients and 
      physicians, whether AI can reduce physician burnout through minimizing in-basket 
      workload (the volume of messages that clinicians must manage within the 
      electronic health record system), and AI's usage as a diagnostic tool. Key 
      concerns addressed in this article include the potential pitfalls associated with 
      AI integration, such as the need for proper clinician training to optimize AI 
      algorithms while ensuring patient safety. The ambiguities surrounding the 
      disclosure of AI in health care and the lack of a legal framework also raise 
      significant concerns regarding patient autonomy, data privacy, trust, and 
      beneficence. Future directions of AI in addressing these challenges are explored, 
      alongside its potential integration into overburdened hospitals, underserved 
      communities, telemedicine, and rural health care settings.

TI  - Innovative Strategies in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Cirrhosis and 
      Associated Syndromes.
LID - 10.3390/life15050779 [doi]
LID - 779
AB  - Liver cirrhosis continues to be a major global health issue, contributing to high 
      morbidity and mortality due to its progressive nature and associated 
      complications. This review explores recent advancements in the diagnosis and 
      treatment of liver cirrhosis and its related syndromes. Non-invasive diagnostic 
      tools, such as elastography and serum biomarkers, have significantly improved 
      early detection, reducing the need for liver biopsies. Advanced imaging 
      techniques, including MRI and CT, further enhance diagnostic accuracy. In 
      parallel, molecular and genomic research is providing new insights into the 
      pathogenesis of the disease, paving the way for precision medicine. On the 
      treatment front, pharmacological innovations, such as antifibrotic agents and 
      targeted therapies, show promise in slowing disease progression. Endoscopic 
      interventions like variceal banding are improving the management of 
      complications, while advancements in liver transplantation and artificial liver 
      support systems offer life-saving alternatives. Regenerative medicine, 
      particularly stem cell therapy and tissue engineering, is emerging as a promising 
      strategy for liver repair. Managing cirrhosis-related syndromes, including portal 
      hypertension, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome, now 
      involves evolving therapeutic approaches such as transjugular intrahepatic 
      portosystemic shunt (TIPS) and novel pharmacotherapies. Prognostic scoring 
      systems like the MELD and Child-Pugh are being refined with new biomarkers for 
      better risk stratification. The future of cirrhosis care will likely involve the 
      integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning for early diagnosis 
      and personalized treatments, alongside emerging therapies currently under 
      investigation. Despite these advancements, challenges such as costs, 
      accessibility, and healthcare disparities remain barriers to widespread adoption. 
      This review highlights the importance of incorporating innovative diagnostic and 
      therapeutic strategies into clinical practice to improve the outcomes for 
      patients with liver cirrhosis and its complications.

AB  - Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) is an essential enzyme in sphingolipid metabolism, 
      catalyzing the phosphorylation of sphingosine to produce sphingosine-1-phosphate 
      (S1P), a bioactive lipid with diverse roles in cell proliferation, survival, and 
      migration. Dysregulation of the SphK1/S1P axis is implicated in a variety of 
      pathological conditions, including inflammatory, metabolic, and neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Targeting SphK1 represents a promising therapeutic strategy, 
      particularly in oncology and inflammation-related pathologies. In this study, we 
      investigated the potential of three natural compounds, Baicalin (BA), Naringenin 
      (NR), and Noscapine (NS) as SphK1 inhibitors. Through combined molecular docking, 
      molecular dynamics simulations, binding studies and enzyme inhibition assays, we 
      identified these compounds as effective SphK1 inhibitors. BA, NR, and NS 
      exhibited binding affinities characterized by IC50 values of 26.542, 32.157, and 
      28.134 muM, respectively. These molecules bind to the active site of SphK1 with 
      favorable binding energies with strong non-covalent interactions. This study 
      provides structural and functional insights into potential of BA, NR, and NS to 
      target SphK1 selectively, which can function as lead compounds for developing 
      novel anti-cancer therapy with minimal off-target effects, offering avenues for 
      developing drugs with enhanced specificity and affinity for this enzyme.

AB  - Lymphomas are heterogeneous hematologic malignancies characterised by the 
      abnormal proliferation of lymphocytes. beta(2)-Microglobulin (beta(2)M) functions both 
      as a structural subunit of primary histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) and 
      as a circulating biomarker with established diagnostic and prognostic 
      significance. Serum beta(2)M > 2.5 mg/L is elevated in 60 % of mantle cell lymphoma 
      and in > 50 % of advanced-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, correlating with 
      higher tumor burden, International Prognostic Index scores, and inferior 
      survival; cerebrospinal fluid beta(2)M enhances central nervous system lymphoma 
      diagnosis with 97 % sensitivity and specificity. Mechanistically, beta(2)M 
      stabilizes MHC I to enable CD8(+) T-cell antigen presentation and, when shed, 
      activates JAK/STAT and NF-kappaB pathways that drive tumor proliferation and immune 
      evasion. Preclinical strategies targeting these beta(2)M-driven signals such as 
      anti-beta(2)M antibodies combined with proteasome inhibitors demonstrate enhanced 
      cytotoxicity in resistant models. Advanced three-dimensional scaffold culture 
      platforms preserve beta(2)M-tumour-immune interactions, allowing for the 
      investigation of matrix stiffness effects on signalling. Emerging mechanotherapy 
      approaches leverage extracellular matrix rigidity to modulate beta(2)M-related 
      pathways and sensitize lymphoma cells to therapy. The remaining challenges 
      include assay standardization, cohort variability, and lack of prospective 
      validation of beta(2)M-based indices. Future efforts should focus on harmonising 
      beta(2)M measurement methods and integrating mechanistic insights into refined risk 
      stratification and therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Real-World Outcomes of PET-Adapted Treatment for Classic Hodgkin's Lymphoma: A 
      Study From a Single Tertiary Care Center.
PG  - e83836

AB  - Background  Classic Hodgkin's lymphoma (CHL) is frequently treated using a 
      positron emission tomography (PET)-directed approach, as demonstrated in the 
      Response-Adapted Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma (RATHL) trial. This study aimed to 
      compare real-world patient outcomes with those reported in the RATHL trial for 
      individuals with advanced-stage disease. Methods This retrospective study 
      included 169 adult patients aged 18 years and older (range 20-66 years). Only 
      patients who received treatment and subsequent follow-up at our institution were 
      included in this study. Results The study population had a male-to-female ratio 
      of 1.86:1, with a median age of 30 years. B symptoms were present in 119 patients 
      (70.4%), while bulky disease (>33% of the transthoracic diameter or >10 cm 
      elsewhere) was observed in 55 patients (32.5%). More than half (57.4%) had stage 
      IV disease at diagnosis, and the median follow-up time was 4.79 years. The 
      three-year overall survival rate was 92.3%, and the progression-free survival 
      rate was 76.9%. Among the 49 patients in the interim PET-positive group, the 
      three-year overall survival and progression-free survival rates were 83.7% and 
      57.1%, respectively. Of these, 17 (34.7%) received escalated therapy with 
      bleomycin, etoposide, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, procarbazine, 
      and prednisone (BEACOPP), while 32 (65.7%) continued with doxorubicin, bleomycin, 
      vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) or standard BEACOPP. No significant survival 
      difference was observed between these treatment groups. In the interim 
      PET-negative group of 104 patients, 84 (80.8%) received ABVD, while 20 (19.2%) 
      received doxorubicin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (AVD). Again, no significant 
      difference in survival was noted between these two groups. When comparing the 
      interim PET-positive cohort to the RATHL trial, the three-year overall survival 
      rates were 83.7% versus 87.8% (p = 0.45), and the progression-free survival rates 
      were 57.1% versus 67.5% (p = 0.17), with no statistically significant difference. 
      Conclusion This study highlights excellent real-world outcomes for treating CHL 
      using a PET-directed approach similar to the RATHL trial. However, despite 
      PET-guided therapy, interim PET positivity remained associated with significantly 
      lower overall survival and progression-free survival rates. De-escalation to AVD 
      in the interim PET-negative group did not negatively affect survival outcomes. 
      ABVD remains a viable treatment option for PET-positive patients with good 
      tolerance, strong response, or near-complete remission with single-site residual 
      disease, without compromising survival.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, and its emerging variants might escape the immune 
      responses generated by existing vaccines and therapeutic mAbs. Accordingly, rapid 
      analysis of their possible neutralization phenotype is essential and can be 
      facilitated by reverse genetics (RGs) systems to regenerate viruses with 
      variant-specific substitutions. Here, we efficiently generate a panel of recent 
      variants of SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron XBB.1.16, EG.5.1, BA.2.86, and JN.1) using a 
      substantially optimized circular polymerase extension reaction (CPER) RGs system. 
      Neutralization potency was analyzed for mAbs targeting different regions of spike 
      protein. mAbs P4-J15, C68.61, S2X259, and IY-2A IgG were able to neutralize all 
      recent viruses. However, S309, which was previously used to treat infection and 
      targets the outer face of RBD, showed  approximately 75-fold reduction in potency versus JN.1. 
      Moreover, C68.59, which targets the SD1 region of the CTD, was unable to 
      neutralize either BA.2.86 or JN1, which share the E554K substitution in SD1. CPER 
      RGs system and microneutralization assays can be adopted as effective tools to 
      evaluate the efficacy of therapeutic mAbs against emerging variants in a 
      time-responsive manner.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neuraminidase in humans is studied to see how well repurposed 
      oseltamivir works for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) using methods like 
      molecular docking, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation, and gene expression 
      analysis. Gene enrichment analysis was also studied to understand the behaviour 
      of neuraminidases in humans. METHODS: Molecular docking was done using 
      oseltamivir and the neuraminidase proteins with the PyRx tool, and the results 
      were analysed using BIOVIA Discovery Studio. MD simulation (50 ns) of the 
      oseltamivir and neuraminidase complex was performed using GROMACS tools. The gene 
      expression analysis and gene enrichment study were done using GEO2R, which showed 
      the results as log FC and significant values. Enricher tool-based gene enrichment 
      analysis was done to determine the gene behaviour related to the AD. RESULTS: The 
      molecular docking showed a strong connection between oseltamivir and 
      neuraminidase (-6.5 kcal/mol), acetylcholinesterase (-7.9 kcal/mol), CDKs 
      (-6.5 kcal/mol), and GSKs (-6.6 kcal/mol), interacting with different amino acids 
      in the protein sequences. MD simulations showed a strong interaction between the 
      ligand and neuraminidase, with stable measurements indicating that both the 
      protein and ligand remained consistent in size and energy, which is better 
      explained through the results of MM_PBSA and MM_GBSA analysis of the complex, 
      resulting in the DeltaE_vdW, DeltaE_elec, DeltaG_polar, DeltaG_nonpolar, DeltaG_gas, (DeltaE_vdW + DeltaEEL), 
      DeltaG_solvation: (DeltaG_polar + DeltaG_nonpolar) and DeltaG_bind: total energies suggesting the 
      complex stayed stable in conditions similar to those resembling natural cell. The 
      gene expression analysis expressed TUBB3 (formation of beta-tubulin), FABP3 
      (regulates alpha-synuclein uptake in dopaminergic neurons), and CALM1 (calcium 
      signal transduction pathway) to be highly upregulated in the given conditions 
      with kinase binding (p = 0.0006541) and protein phosphatase regulatory activity 
      (p = 0.001357) were highly upregulated, implicating their importance in the AD. 
      DISCUSSION: The study ends on a hopeful note for using oseltamivir to treat 
      neurological diseases, but it suggests that future research should include a 
      solid cell line study, an in vitro study, and a clinical study.

AB  - Microplastic (MP) pollution in agricultural soils poses a significant threat, 
      particularly under changing climatic conditions. This study investigates the 
      combined effects of MP contamination and elevated temperatures (29 degrees C and 42 degrees C) on 
      paddy soil nutrient dynamics, rice physiology in heat-sensitive and heat-tolerant 
      genotypes, rhizosphere phoD-harboring bacteria, and microbial community 
      composition in a controlled growth chamber. Soil properties, gene expression, and 
      microbial diversity were analyzed using flow injection analysis, qPCR, and 
      high-throughput sequencing. At 29 degrees C, MP exposure reduced soil inorganic 
      phosphorus (Pi), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen 
      (DON), and NO(3)(-)-N by 7-50 %, while increasing NH(4)(+)-N by 21-26 %, with greater 
      effects on heat-sensitive genotypes. Conversely, at 42 degrees C, MP increased Pi, DOC, 
      DON, and NO(3)(-)-N by 5-35 % and decreased NH(4)(+)-N by 16-28 %. MP reduced phoD and 
      16S rRNA gene abundance at 29 degrees C (0.74-0.96-fold) but increased them at 42 degrees C 
      (0.28-9.31-fold). Rice phosphorus transporter gene expression varied, with OsPT1 
      and OsPT6 upregulated at 29 degrees C and OsPT8 at 42 degrees C. Microbial diversity increased at 
      42 degrees C, favoring Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Burkholderiaceae, while 
      Firmicutes and Acidobacteria declined, especially in heat-sensitive rice. Key 
      taxa like Geobacter, Clostridium, and Zopfiella were enriched at 42 degrees C, improving 
      Pi availability and plant biomass. Enhanced amino acid and carbohydrate 
      metabolism at 42 degrees C supported rice growth despite MP contamination. This study 
      reveals how rising temperatures modulate microplastic impacts on soil nutrient 
      cycling and microbial activity, highlighting critical interactions for 
      sustainable agriculture under climate change.

AB  - Cadmium (Cd) contamination threatens agroecosystems and food security by 
      degrading soil health, inducing plant oxidative stress, and reducing crop yields. 
      Sustainable strategies integrating biochar (BC) with nanoparticles (NPs) for Cd 
      immobilization and soil-plant-microbe restoration remain underexplored. Here, we 
      demonstrate the efficacy of BC, nano-silicon (nSi), and nano-iron (nFe) to 
      immobilize Cd, improve soil health and reprogram maize stress responses in 
      Cd-contaminated soil. Soil Cd bioavailability, microbial networks, and maize 
      transcriptomes were analyzed under varying BC-nSi-nFe formulations. Among these 
      formulations, the BC + 25 % nSi + 75 % nFe + Cd (T6) composite reduced 
      bioavailable Cd by 21 %, raised soil pH from 6.21 to 6.98, and enhanced soil 
      enzyme activities (118-139 %). T6 improved maize biomass (115-119 %), reduced 
      shoot Cd accumulation (78 %), and suppressed oxidative stress (67-75 % ROS 
      reduction). This study presents transcriptomic evidence showing that BC-NPs 
      composites mitigate Cd stress and modulate maize antioxidant defense and 
      phytohormone signaling pathways, offering new insights into the molecular 
      mechanisms underlying improved plant resilience. Soil microbial networks shifted 
      toward metal-resistant taxa, with enriched glutathione metabolism and nitrogen 
      fixation. BC-NPs composites offer a multidimensional remediation strategy, 
      integrating nanomaterial science, microbial ecology, and plant molecular biology 
      to mitigate Cd toxicity. This approach enhances soil-plant resilience, supporting 
      sustainable agriculture in contaminated ecosystems.

AB  - Corneal injuries and infections pose a serious threat to vision. However, 
      conventional therapies topical antibiotics, synthetic grafts, and bandage contact 
      lenses often fail to provide enduring antimicrobial defense and robust tissue 
      regeneration. Researchers derive chitosan-based hydrogels from deacetylated 
      chitin, combining intrinsic polycationic antimicrobial efficacy with tunable 
      biodegradation and excellent biocompatibility, thereby addressing both challenges 
      simultaneously. These hydrogels exert broad-spectrum infection control by 
      disrupting bacterial membranes, chelating essential metal ions and amplifying 
      adjunctive agents such as antibiotics or silver nanoparticles against Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Optimized fabrication through physical 
      crosslinking (electrostatic interactions, metal-ion coordination, hydrophobic 
      associations) and covalent strategies (photoinitiated or radiation-induced 
      polymerization) yields scaffolds that withstand eyelid shear forces without 
      compromising corneal transparency. In vitro evaluations show that human corneal 
      epithelial cells and keratocytes remain over 95 % viable, while in vivo 
      alkali-burn studies in rabbits and rats reveal rapid re-epithelialization, 
      stromal remodeling, and nerve regeneration with minimal inflammation. Beyond 
      structural support, chitosan hydrogels actively sculpt the healing 
      microenvironment by scavenging reactive oxygen species, down-regulating 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and enabling thermosresponsive release of bioactive 
      factors such as stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha, ferulic acid, and exosomes, by 
      addressing translational hurdles including sterilization without loss of 
      bioactivity, reproducible manufacturing, regulatory compliance for ophthalmic 
      biomaterials and synchronization of degradation kinetics with healing timelines. 
      This review integrates molecular insights, fabrication strategies and in vivo 
      performance data to inform the rational design of optimized chitosan hydrogel 
      formulations for next-generation ocular therapeutics.

AB  - The stomach is one of the main digestive organs in the GIT, essential for 
      digestion and nutrient absorption. However, various gastrointestinal diseases, 
      including gastritis, ulcers, and cancer, affect health and quality of life 
      severely. The precise diagnosis of gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases is a 
      significant challenge in the field of healthcare, as misclassification leads to 
      late prescriptions and negative consequences for patients. Even with the 
      advancement in machine learning and explainable AI for medical image analysis, 
      existing methods tend to have high false negative rates which compromise critical 
      disease cases. This paper presents a hybrid deep learning based explainable 
      artificial intelligence (XAI) approach to improve the accuracy of 
      gastrointestinal disorder diagnosis, including stomach diseases, from images 
      acquired endoscopically. Swin Transformer with DCNN (EfficientNet-B3, ResNet-50) 
      is integrated to improve both the accuracy of diagnostics and the 
      interpretability of the model to extract robust features. Stacked machine 
      learning classifiers with meta-loss and XAI techniques (Grad-CAM) are combined to 
      minimize false negatives, which helps in early and accurate medical diagnoses in 
      GI tract disease evaluation. The proposed model successfully achieved an accuracy 
      of 93.79% with a lower misclassification rate, which is effective for 
      gastrointestinal tract disease classification. Class-wise performance metrics, 
      such as precision, recall, and F1-score, show considerable improvements with 
      false-negative rates being reduced. AI-driven GI tract disease diagnosis becomes 
      more accessible for medical professionals through Grad-CAM because it provides 
      visual explanations about model predictions. This study makes the prospect of 
      using a synergistic DL with XAI open for improvement towards early diagnosis with 
      fewer human errors and also guiding doctors handling gastrointestinal diseases.

AB  - Ovarian cancer remains one of the most lethal gynecological malignancies, with a 
      high mortality rate primarily due to late-stage diagnosis. Genetic 
      predispositions play a significant role in its development, alongside 
      environmental and lifestyle factors. The main objective of the study was to check 
      the association of XRCC1, XRCC3, and RAD51 gene polymorphism with ovarian cancer. 
      In the present 300 ovarian cancer patients and 300 healthy controls blood samples 
      collected. The results showed that the heterozygous (GA) genotype of rs25487 SNP 
      shows significant correlation with ovarian cancer with decreased risk of disease 
      (OR = 0.39; 95% CI = 0.17-0.88; p < 0.02), whereas the homozygous variant (AA) 
      genotype of the same SNP exhibits a non-significant relation with ovarian cancer. 
      The combined genotype model of this SNP indicated a highly significant 
      association with increased risk of ovarian cancer by twofold (OR = 2.10;95% CI = 
      1.22-3.64; p < 0.007). In case of rs861539 heterozygous (CT) showed significant 
      association by increasing the risk of disease almost threefold (OR = 2.73; 95% CI 
      1.68-4.41; p < 0.0001). while the mutant (TT) of the same SNP showed again 
      significant association but with decreased risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.27; 95% 
      CI 0.16-0.47; p < 0.0001). The genotype distribution of the RAD51 gene's SNP 
      (rs1801320) shows that heterozygous (GC) individuals exhibit a significant 
      correlation and increased risk of ovarian cancer by twofold (OR = 2.81;95% CI = 
      1.72-4.60; p </= 0.0001). Conversely, the mutant (CC) of rs1801320 exhibits a 
      significant correlation with a decrease in the risk of ovarian cancer (OR = 0.32; 
      95% CI = 0.19-0.55; p < 0.0001). In conclusion, the study's findings suggest that 
      a higher chance of ovarian cancer is related to the gene XRCC1, XRCC3, and RAD51 
      polymorphisms. In this study, SNPs were analyzed for their potential role as 
      biomarkers for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer.

TI  - Primary adrenal CD20-negative diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Diagnostic and 
      therapeutic challenges-A case report.

AB  - Primary adrenal lymphoma (PAL) is a rare, aggressive malignancy, often 
      manifesting as bilateral adrenal masses with insufficiency. CD20-negative diffuse 
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a rarer variant, exhibits resistance to standard 
      therapies and a poorer prognosis. We report a 60-year-old woman with bilateral 
      adrenal masses diagnosed as CD20-negative unclassifiable DLBCL. Despite an 
      initial response to CHOP chemotherapy, her disease progressed, necessitating 
      salvage therapy with gemcitabine, cisplatin and dexamethasone. This case 
      highlights the diagnostic complexity of CD20-negative DLBCL, particularly when 
      presenting in rare extra-nodal sites such as the adrenal glands. Comprehensive 
      immunohistochemical profiling and multidisciplinary management are crucial for 
      accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Given the poor prognosis and lack of 
      standardized therapies, further research is needed to refine treatment strategies 
      and improve outcomes for patients with CD20-negative DLBCL.

TI  - Endophyte-enriched biochar and zeolite for heavy metal immobilization in 
      sewage-irrigated soils: impacts on Spinacia oleracea growth and antioxidant 
      responses.
PG  - 1-20
LID - 10.1080/15226514.2025.2526599 [doi]
AB  - Untreated sewage water (SW) irrigation in farmlands leads to the accumulation of 
      toxic metals in soils, which can cause serious concerns for food safety and 
      global food security. This study evaluated the effectiveness of endophytic 
      enriched biochar (EBC) and endophytic enriched zeolite (EZE) as immobilizing 
      agents to reduce heavy metal uptake in Spinacea oleracea (S. oleracea) irrigated 
      with SW. In a pot experiment, EBC and EZE were applied at rate of 1% w/w with 
      control treatment. The experiment was arranged in completely randomized design 
      with three replicates. Results showed that SW negatively affected spinach growth 
      and physiology. However, applying EBC and EZE, alone or in combination, 
      considerably improved growth and physiology by reducing cadmium (Cd) and chromium 
      (Cr) uptake. Interestingly, combining EBC and EZE with tap water (TW) and SW 
      increased shoot and root dry weights by 80.58% and 71.83%, reducing Cd and Cr 
      uptake in shoots by 93% and 75%, respectively, compared to the control. 
      Additionally, this combination significantly decreased antioxidant enzyme 
      activity, particularly Ascorbate peroxidase (APX, 59.4%), Catalase (CAT, 42.3%), 
      Glutathione peroxidase (GPX, 68%). The co-application of EBC and EZE under TW+SW 
      (1:1) enhanced phyto-stabilization efficiency significantly and minimized health 
      risks from spinach consumption. The improvement in plant growth with EBC and EZE 
      under Cd and Cr stress suggests that both amendments could be efficient for 
      promoting the Cd and Cr immobilization and improving the soil quality in Cd and 
      Cr-contaminated soil. This emphasizes their capacity as sustainable soil enhancer 
      for the remediation of Cd and Cr-contaminated soils, promotion of healthy plant 
      biomass and support the prolonged ecological restoration.

TI  - Icariin as a therapeutic agent in breast cancer: modulating apoptosis and 
      suppressing proliferation.
LID - 10.1515/jcim-2024-0405 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, 
      underscoring the urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies. Icariin, a 
      prenylated flavonol glycoside derived from Epimedium species, has emerged as a 
      promising multi-targeted agent with potent anticancer activity. Preclinical 
      studies demonstrate that icariin modulates key oncogenic pathways, including 
      PI3K/Akt, MAPK, NF-kappaB/SIRT6, and AMPK/mTOR to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, 
      induce apoptosis, and regulate autophagy. Moreover, icariin exhibits 
      anti-metastatic effects by suppressing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, 
      matrix metalloproteinase activity, and immunomodulatory actions that may enhance 
      antitumor immunity. Despite these encouraging findings, a comprehensive 
      understanding of its molecular mechanisms and translational potential remains 
      limited. Here, we systematically review the latest in vitro and in vivo evidence 
      on icariin's pharmacological effects in breast cancer models. We highlight 
      advances in nanoformulation approaches to improve their bioavailability and 
      identify critical knowledge gaps. This review aims to guide future research 
      toward optimized delivery systems and well-designed clinical trials by 
      integrating mechanistic insights with formulation science. Ultimately, 
      elucidating the full therapeutic profile of icariin will inform its incorporation 
      into complementary and integrative oncology regimens, potentially improving 
      outcomes for patients with diverse breast cancer subtypes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cumulative stress is a major risk factor for developing major 
      depressive disorder (MDD), yet not everyone experiencing chronic stress develops 
      MDD. In those who do not, it is unclear at what point, or by what mechanism, a 
      trajectory of stable resiliency emerges. METHODS: Utilizing a 10-day repeated 
      social defeat stress model (RSDS) for MDD, we observed that a critical period 
      between 7 and 10 daily defeats marks the phenotypical divergence of resilient 
      from susceptible mice. Using cell-type selective electrophysiology, 
      chemogenetics, optogenetics, fiber photometry and RNA quantification was employed 
      to investigate the nature of stress effects on neuroadaptation in the oval 
      nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNSTov) required to determine 
      resilience. RESULTS: In response to ongoing stress, corticotropin-releasing 
      factor (CRF (+) , but not CRF (-) ) neurons of the (BNSTov) displayed a sustained 
      increased firing rate in resilient, but not susceptible mice. This 
      neurophysiological adaptation was self-sustaining, but only after 7 critical 
      stress exposures, indicating that the process of developing resilience is 
      dependent on stress history. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals a novel process by 
      which individuals might persist in the face of adversity by way of 
      stress-provoked activation, not inhibition of a key CRF limbic region that 
      establishes a pathway to resilience.

AB  - Alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, zinc-binding (AZGP1), functions as a serum AZGP1 
      biomarker with applications in cancer detection, prognosis, and therapeutic 
      monitoring. This review evaluates AZGP1's analytical performance and clinical 
      utility in multiple malignancies based on immunoassay and mass spectrometry 
      studies. ELISA and chemiluminescent immunoassays yield area-under-curve values of 
      0.78-0.89 for early colorectal and prostate cancer detection, often surpassing 
      prostate-specific and carcinoembryonic antigens levels. Mass spectrometry studies 
      have identified AZGP1 proteoforms, the abundance of which correlates with tumor 
      burden and progression. Multivariate clinical analyses confirmed that elevated 
      serum AZGP1 levels independently predict poorer overall and disease-free survival 
      in colorectal, lung, and breast cancers. Simultaneously, preclinical models have 
      demonstrated the role of AZGP1 in lipid mobilization, epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition, and modulation of tumor-stromal and immune interactions. We highlight 
      the integration of mechanistic insights with proteoform-specific data and the 
      need to harmonize preanalytical and analytical protocols. We propose a plan that 
      includes the development of reference standards, conducting large prospective 
      trials within biobank networks, and using artificial intelligence to discover 
      combined proteomic signatures of the disease. These efforts aim to establish 
      serum AZGP1 as a reliable, minimally invasive biomarker that improves early 
      detection, prognostic stratification, and informs precision oncology.

TI  - Targeted Protein Degradation in Lung Cancer: The Emerging Role of PROTAC 
      Technology and E3 Ligases.
LID - 10.2174/0109298673382742250619055201 [doi]
AB  - Lung cancer remains one of the most prevalent and lethal malignancies, with poor 
      drug response and high mortality rates. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) 
      are emerging as a novel therapeutic strategy, leveraging E3 ligases to degrade 
      oncogenic proteins selectively via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. These 
      degraders offer higher selectivity and bioavailability compared to traditional 
      inhibitors. This review explores how PROTACs eliminate oncogenic proteins in lung 
      cancer and examines the role of E3 ligases in this process. Commonly utilized 
      ligases include Cereblon (CRBN) and Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), while newer ones, 
      such as MDM2 and Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), are being 
      investigated for therapeutic potential. We discuss key factors in PROTAC design, 
      including ligand selection, linker optimization, and pharmacokinetic properties, 
      which influence tumor specificity and efficacy while minimizing off- target 
      effects. Additionally, we highlight targetable oncogenic drivers in lung cancer, 
      such as KRAS, EGFR, and ALK fusion proteins, and evaluate preclinical and 
      clinical studies that demonstrate PROTACs' potential for overcoming drug 
      resistance. The challenges associated with clinical translation, tumor 
      microenvironment interactions, and E3 ligase selection are also discussed. 
      Finally, we present future perspectives, including expanding the range of E3 
      ligases, developing multitargeting strategies, and integrating next-generation 
      molecular glue degraders. By offering a comparative analysis of E3 ligase- 
      specific PROTACs, this review underscores the potential of PROTAC technology to 
      advance precision oncology in lung cancer.

AB  - Identifying new genetic variants linked to plasma lipoprotein-lipid 
      concentrations is of significant public health importance, as it can aid in 
      developing genetic markers for CVD risk assessment, diagnosis, and prognosis. Our 
      work aimed to investigate the relationship between lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 
      genetic polymorphisms and hyperlipidemia in Pakistani population. To achieve this 
      goal, 400 blood samples were obtained. DNA was extracted for the measurement of 
      biochemical variables and genetic profiling. A lipid lowering agent, fibrate 
      (200mg/day) is administered to the patients for two months. The online genetic 
      epidemiology tool (http/www.oege.org) was used to determine the allelic and 
      genomic frequencies. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated by chi-square. 
      Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in LPL gene, rs258 (T > C) and rs268 (A>G) 
      were genotyped in 300 hypertriglyceridemia patients and 100 healthy/control 
      individuals. The LPL gene showed a significant association with a high risk of 
      hyperlipidemia diseases when differentiate the genotype evaluations between 
      treated and untreated patients. Lipid levels were significantly (p<0.05) reduced 
      after treatment. LPL SNP rs258 and rs268 were observed to be associated to 
      hypertriglyceridemia in the Pakistani patients. Fibrate therapy showed a positive 
      effect on the serum lipid levels after treating the patients with 200mg/day for 
      two months.

TI  - Griscelli Syndrome: A Case Report from Pakistan, A Review of the Literature, and 
      an Approach to Hematological Disorders Associated With Albinism.
PG  - e86445
LID - 10.7759/cureus.86445 [doi]

AB  - Griscelli syndrome (GS) is a rare genetic disorder that is classified into three 
      distinct types. Partial oculocutaneous albinism is common to all three types. In 
      addition, neurological abnormalities and immunodeficiency are seen in types 1 and 
      2, respectively. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is common in GS-2. We 
      present a case of a four-year-old boy who presented with features of albinism, 
      recurrent infections, and hepatosplenomegaly. His complete blood count (CBC) 
      revealed pancytopenia, and bone marrow biopsy showed prominent hemophagocytic 
      activity. Serum ferritin was elevated, and fibrinogen was low. The diagnostic 
      criteria for HLH were met. Hair shaft microscopy revealed large, irregularly 
      spaced clumps of melanin in the medulla. A diagnosis of GS-2 was made. 
      Unfortunately, the patient died before mutation analysis could be performed. 
      Along with this case report, we have included a literature review of 42 cases 
      from 33 case reports and case series. We also propose a diagnostic approach to 
      three hematological disorders associated with albinism, Chediak-Higashi syndrome 
      (CHS), Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS), and GS.

      Super India Kainat 1121 (2024 harvest) rice. Purposely, inferior quality stored 
      rice of same variety (2023, 2022, and 2021 harvests) was used to adulterate at 
      10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, and 75 % levels. Characteristic profile of volatile 
      compounds in rice procured during different years was identified using 
      HS-SPME-GC/MS. Olfactory sensor arrays were employed to capture the volatile 
      compounds, yielding a characteristic colorimetric map depending upon chemical 
      environment. Discrimination of rice adulteration was realized using PCA, HCA, and 
      kNN algorithms. Distinct grouping of rice samples based on variable levels of 
      adulteration was achieved using PCA and HCA models. The kNN algorithm 
      demonstrated excellent performance for identification of rice adulteration with 
      inferior quality grains. Conclusively, fabricated olfactory sensor arrays were 
      able to successfully discriminate rice adulteration, offering rapid, simple, and 
      low-cost analysis.

AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA) has emerged as a significant environmental pollutant, posing 
      serious risks to ecosystems, especially in agricultural settings. It is essential 
      to evaluate the toxic effects of BPA on rice cultivation and soil microbiome amid 
      rising global temperature. Therefore, this study investigated the simultaneous 
      effects of BPA (0, 1.5, 12, and 20 mg kg(-1)) along with two temperature regimes 
      (29/24(0)C and 42/38(0)C) on the growth, development, and rhizospheric microbial 
      dynamics of two contrasting rice genotypes: High-Temperature Resistant (HTR-1) 
      and High-Temperature Sensitive (HTS-5). The results showed that elevated BPA 
      concentrations under rising temperatures significantly inhibited chlorophyll 
      content (by 54.70 % and 42.40 %), reduced ROS scavenging activity, modulated 
      abscisic acid production (by 84.89 % and 53.00 %), leading to impaired 
      physiological responses in exposed rice genotypes. Furthermore, HTR-1 exhibited 
      higher ABA levels, a lower transpiration rate, and reduced BPA accumulation in 
      seedlings under stress conditions, resulting in superior growth compared to 
      HTS-5. The combined stress dramatically altered the structure and composition of 
      bacterial and fungal communities and favoured the dominance of more resilient 
      phyla and genera. Notably, bacterial phyla such as Proteobacteria (16.50 %) and 
      Chloroflexi (26.60 %), as well as fungal phyla Ascomycota (24 %) and 
      Chytridiomycota (210 %) were abundant, while, Anaerolinea and Zopfiella were 
      notably enriched at the genus level in the rhizosphere of HTR-1 genotype. This 
      study demonstrated that selecting temperature-tolerant rice varieties and 
      understanding plant-microbe interactions are crucial for mitigating the combined 
      effects of heat and BPA pollution in sustainable agriculture.

AB  - A potent anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), has substantial off-target 
      hepatotoxicity, which limits its clinical use. The current study aimed to 
      investigate the hepatoprotective effect of aegeline against DOX- induced 
      hepatotoxicity in rats. Four groups of rats were randomly divided into following: 
      Group I- Control (saline), group II - DOX, group III DOX + aegeline 
      (5 mg/kg/p.o.), and group IV DOX + aegeline (10 mg/kg/p.o.). Various biochemical 
      parameters such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), 
      alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, oxidative stress markers such as 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde 
      (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), inflammatory markers such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), 
      interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappa-B 
      (NF-kappaB) and apoptosis markers, i.e. Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein), B-cell 
      lymphoma 2 (Bcl2), caspase-3 and caspase-9 were performed. Additionally, 
      histopathology and molecular docking were performed. Administration of aegeline 
      at both tested doses led to a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in liver enzyme 
      levels such as ALT, ALP, and AST-in rats with DOX-induced hepatotoxicity, 
      indicating improved liver function. Antioxidant defenses were also markedly 
      enhanced in the aegeline-treated groups, as evidenced by increased levels of GSH, 
      SOD, and CAT compared to the DOX-only group. In terms of inflammation, aegeline 
      treatment significantly (P < 0.05) lowered the concentrations of key inflammatory 
      cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and the transcription factor NF-kappaB. This 
      suggests a strong anti-inflammatory effect. Regarding apoptosis, the expression 
      levels of pro-apoptotic markers-Caspase-3, Caspase-9, and Bax were notably 
      decreased in the aegeline-treated rats, while levels of the anti-apoptotic 
      protein Bcl-2 were elevated, pointing to a protective role against DOX-induced 
      cell death. Molecular docking analysis further supported these findings, showing 
      favorable interactions between aegeline and several target proteins. Notably, 
      aegeline exhibited the strongest binding affinity with Bcl-2 (- 6.568 kcal/mol), 
      primarily through hydrophobic interactions, suggesting potential molecular 
      targets contributing to its therapeutic effects. The present study accredited the 
      hepatoprotective effect of aegeline (5 and 10 mg/kg) by ameliorating Dox-induced 
      hepatotoxicity in an experimental animal model.
