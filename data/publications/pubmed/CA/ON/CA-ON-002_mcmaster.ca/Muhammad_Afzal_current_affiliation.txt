AB  - Processing huge repository of medical literature for extracting relevant and 
      high-quality evidences demands efficient evidence support methods. We aim at 
      developing methods to automate the process of finding quality evidences from a 
      plethora of literature documents and grade them according to the context (local 
      condition). We propose a two-level methodology for quality recognition and 
      grading of evidences. First, quality is recognized using quality recognition 
      model; second, context-aware grading of evidences is accomplished. Using 10-fold 
      cross-validation, the proposed quality recognition model achieved an accuracy of 
      92.14 percent and improved the baseline system accuracy by about 24 percent. The 
      proposed context-aware grading method graded 808 out of 1354 test evidences as 
      highly beneficial for treatment purpose. This infers that around 60 percent 
      evidences shall be given more importance as compared to the other 40 percent 
      evidences. The inclusion of context in recommendation of evidence makes the 
      process of evidence-based decision-making "situation-aware."

TI  - Cerebral Microbleeds and the Effect of Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction on 
      Hematoma Expansion and Functional Outcomes: A Secondary Analysis of the ATACH-2 
      Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 850-859
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2018.0454 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Response to intensive blood pressure (BP) lowering in acute 
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) might vary with the degree of underlying cerebral 
      small vessel disease. OBJECTIVES: To characterize cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in 
      acute ICH and to assess the potential for interaction between underlying small 
      vessel disease (as indicated by CMB number and location) and assignment to acute 
      intensive BP targeting for functional outcomes and hematoma expansion. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Preplanned subgroup analyses in the Antihypertensive 
      Treatment of Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage 2 (ATACH-2) trial were performed. The 
      ATACH-2 was an open-label international randomized clinical trial that 
      investigated optimal acute BP lowering in 1000 patients with acute ICH. Analyses 
      followed the intent-to-treat paradigm. Participants were enrolled between May 
      2011 and September 2015 and followed up for 3 months. Eligible participants were 
      aged at least 18 years with ICH volumes less than 60 mL on computed tomography 
      (CT) and a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 5 on initial assessment, in whom 
      study drug could be initiated within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. Eight hundred 
      thirty-three participants were excluded, leaving 167 who had an interpretable 
      axial T2*-weighted gradient-recalled echo sequence on magnetic resonance imaging 
      to assess CMBs for inclusion in these subgroup analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND 
      MEASURES: The primary outcome of interest was death or disability (modified 
      Ranking Scale score, 4-6) at 3 months. The secondary outcome of interest was 
      hematoma volume expansion of at least 33% on a CT scan obtained 24 hours after 
      randomization compared with the entry scan. RESULTS: A total of 167 patients were 
      included; their mean (SD) age was 61.9 (13.2) years, and 98 (58.7%) were male. 
      Cerebral microbleeds were present in 120 patients. Forty-six of 157 (29.3%) 
      patients had poor outcome (modified Ranking Scale score, >/=4), and hematoma 
      expansion was observed in 29 of 144 (20.1%) patients. Risk of poor outcome was 
      similar for those assigned to intensive vs standard acute BP lowering among 
      patients with CMBs (relative risk, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.61-2.33; P = .61) and those 
      without CMBs (relative risk, 1.42; 95% CI, 0.43-4.70; P = .57), and no 
      significant interaction was observed (interaction coefficient, 0.18; 95% CI, 
      -1.20 to 1.55; P = .80). Risk of hematoma expansion was also similar, and no 
      significant interaction between treatment and CMBs was observed (interaction 
      coefficient, 0.62; 95% CI, -1.08 to 2.31; P = .48). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: 
      Cerebral microbleeds are highly prevalent among patients with ICH but do not seem 
      to influence response to acute intensive BP treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01176565.

TI  - Intensive Blood Pressure Lowering and DWI Lesions in Intracerebral Hemorrhage: 
      Exploratory Analysis of the ATACH-2 Randomized Trial.
PG  - 71-81
LID - 10.1007/s12028-021-01254-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing use of magnetic resonance imaging in the 
      assessment of acute intracerebral hemorrhage, diffusion-weighted imaging 
      hyperintense lesions have been recognized to occur at sites remote to the 
      hematoma in up to 40% of patients. We investigated whether blood pressure 
      reduction was associated with diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintense lesions in 
      acute intracerebral hemorrhage and whether such lesions are associated with worse 
      clinical outcomes by analyzing imaging data from a randomized trial. METHODS: We 
      performed exploratory subgroup analyses in an open-label randomized trial that 
      investigated acute blood pressure lowering in 1000 patients with intracerebral 
      hemorrhage between May 2011 and September 2015. Eligible participants were 
      assigned to an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 110-139 mm Hg versus 
      140-179 mm Hg with the use of intravenous nicardipine. Of these, 171 patients had 
      requisite magnetic resonance imaging sequences for inclusion in these subgroup 
      analyses. The primary outcome was the presence of diffusion-weighted imaging 
      hyperintense lesions. Secondary outcomes included death or disability and serious 
      adverse event at 90 days. RESULTS: Diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintense 
      lesions were present in 25% of patients (mean age 62 years). Hematoma volume > 30 
      cm(3) was an adjusted predictor (adjusted relative risk 2.41, 95% confidence 
      interval 1.00-5.80) of lesion presence. Lesions occurred in 25% of intensively 
      treated patients and 24% of standard treatment patients (relative risk 1.01, 95% 
      confidence interval 0.71-1.43, p = 0.97). Patients with diffusion-weighted 
      imaging hyperintense lesions had similar frequencies of death or disability at 
      90 days, compared with patients without lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Randomized 
      assignment to intensive acute blood pressure lowering did not result in a greater 
      frequency of diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintense lesion. Alternative 
      mechanisms of diffusion-weighted imaging hyperintense lesion formation other than 
      hemodynamic fluctuations need to be explored. Clinical trial registration

TI  - Cancer Incidence, Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability, and 
      Disability-Adjusted Life Years for 29 Cancer Groups From 2010 to 2019: A 
      Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019.
PG  - 420-444
LID - 10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.6987 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2019 
      (GBD 2019) provided systematic estimates of incidence, morbidity, and mortality 
      to inform local and international efforts toward reducing cancer burden. 
      OBJECTIVE: To estimate cancer burden and trends globally for 204 countries and 
      territories and by Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles from 2010 to 2019. 
      EVIDENCE REVIEW: The GBD 2019 estimation methods were used to describe cancer 
      incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost, and 
      disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2019 and over the past decade. 
      Estimates are also provided by quintiles of the SDI, a composite measure of 
      educational attainment, income per capita, and total fertility rate for those 
      younger than 25 years. Estimates include 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). 
      FINDINGS: In 2019, there were an estimated 23.6 million (95% UI, 22.2-24.9 
      million) new cancer cases (17.2 million when excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) 
      and 10.0 million (95% UI, 9.36-10.6 million) cancer deaths globally, with an 
      estimated 250 million (235-264 million) DALYs due to cancer. Since 2010, these 
      represented a 26.3% (95% UI, 20.3%-32.3%) increase in new cases, a 20.9% (95% UI, 
      14.2%-27.6%) increase in deaths, and a 16.0% (95% UI, 9.3%-22.8%) increase in 
      DALYs. Among 22 groups of diseases and injuries in the GBD 2019 study, cancer was 
      second only to cardiovascular diseases for the number of deaths, years of life 
      lost, and DALYs globally in 2019. Cancer burden differed across SDI quintiles. 
      The proportion of years lived with disability that contributed to DALYs increased 
      with SDI, ranging from 1.4% (1.1%-1.8%) in the low SDI quintile to 5.7% 
      (4.2%-7.1%) in the high SDI quintile. While the high SDI quintile had the highest 
      number of new cases in 2019, the middle SDI quintile had the highest number of 
      cancer deaths and DALYs. From 2010 to 2019, the largest percentage increase in 
      the numbers of cases and deaths occurred in the low and low-middle SDI quintiles. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this systematic analysis suggest that 
      the global burden of cancer is substantial and growing, with burden differing by 
      SDI. These results provide comprehensive and comparable estimates that can 
      potentially inform efforts toward equitable cancer control around the world.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Identifying practice-ready evidence-based journal articles in 
      medicine is a challenge due to the sheer volume of biomedical research 
      publications. Newer approaches to support evidence discovery apply deep learning 
      techniques to improve the efficiency and accuracy of classifying sound evidence. 
      OBJECTIVE: To determine how well deep learning models using variants of 
      Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) identify 
      high-quality evidence with high clinical relevance from the biomedical literature 
      for consideration in clinical practice. METHODS: We fine-tuned variations of BERT 
      models (BERT(BASE), BioBERT, BlueBERT, and PubMedBERT) and compared their 
      performance in classifying articles based on methodological quality criteria. The 
      dataset used for fine-tuning models included titles and abstracts of >160,000 
      PubMed records from 2012 to 2020 that were of interest to human health which had 
      been manually labeled based on meeting established critical appraisal criteria 
      for methodological rigor. The data was randomly divided into 80:10:10 sets for 
      training, validating, and testing. In addition to using the full unbalanced set, 
      the training data was randomly undersampled into four balanced datasets to assess 
      performance and select the best performing model. For each of the four sets, one 
      model that maintained sensitivity (recall) at >/=99% was selected and were 
      ensembled. The best performing model was evaluated in a prospective, blinded test 
      and applied to an established reference standard, the Clinical Hedges dataset. 
      RESULTS: In training, three of the four selected best performing models were 
      trained using BioBERT(BASE). The ensembled model did not boost performance 
      compared with the best individual model. Hence a solo BioBERT-based model (named 
      DL-PLUS) was selected for further testing as it was computationally more 
      efficient. The model had high recall (>99%) and 60% to 77% specificity in a 
      prospective evaluation conducted with blinded research associates and saved >60% 
      of the work required to identify high quality articles. CONCLUSIONS: Deep 
      learning using pretrained language models and a large dataset of classified 
      articles produced models with improved specificity while maintaining >99% recall. 
      The resulting DL-PLUS model identifies high-quality, clinically relevant articles 
      from PubMed at the time of publication. The model improves the efficiency of a 
      literature surveillance program, which allows for faster dissemination of 
      appraised research.

AB  - Evidence-based medicine (EBM) emerged from McMaster University in the 1980-1990s, 
      which emphasizes the integration of the best research evidence with clinical 
      expertise and patient values. The Health Information Research Unit (HiRU) was 
      created at McMaster University in 1985 to support EBM. Early on, digital health 
      informatics took the form of teaching clinicians how to search MEDLINE with 
      modems and phone lines. Searching and retrieval of published articles were 
      transformed as electronic platforms provided greater access to clinically 
      relevant studies, systematic reviews, and clinical practice guidelines, with 
      PubMed playing a pivotal role. In the early 2000s, the HiRU introduced Clinical 
      Queries-validated search filters derived from the curated, gold-standard, 
      human-appraised Hedges dataset-to enhance the precision of searches, allowing 
      clinicians to hone their queries based on study design, population, and outcomes. 
      Currently, almost 1 million articles are added to PubMed annually. To filter 
      through this volume of heterogenous publications for clinically important 
      articles, the HiRU team and other researchers have been applying classical 
      machine learning, deep learning, and, increasingly, large language models (LLMs). 
      These approaches are built upon the foundation of gold-standard annotated 
      datasets and humans in the loop for active machine learning. In this viewpoint, 
      we explore the evolution of health informatics in supporting evidence search and 
      retrieval processes over the past 25+ years within the HiRU, including the 
      evolving roles of LLMs and responsible artificial intelligence, as we continue to 
      facilitate the dissemination of knowledge, enabling clinicians to integrate the 
      best available evidence into their clinical practice.

AB  - Given the suboptimal performance of Boolean searching to identify 
      methodologically sound and clinically relevant studies in large bibliographic 
      databases, exploring machine learning (ML) to efficiently classify studies is 
      warranted. To boost the efficiency of a literature surveillance program, we used 
      a large internationally recognized dataset of articles tagged for methodological 
      rigor and applied an automated ML approach to train and test binary 
      classification models to predict the probability of clinical research articles 
      being of high methodologic quality. We trained over 12,000 models on a dataset of 
      titles and abstracts of 97,805 articles indexed in PubMed from 2012-2018 which 
      were manually appraised for rigor by highly trained research associates and rated 
      for clinical relevancy by practicing clinicians. As the dataset is unbalanced, 
      with more articles that do not meet the criteria for rigor, we used the 
      unbalanced dataset and over- and under-sampled datasets. Models that maintained 
      sensitivity for high rigor at 99% and maximized specificity were selected and 
      tested in a retrospective set of 30,424 articles from 2020 and validated 
      prospectively in a blinded study of 5253 articles. The final selected algorithm, 
      combining a LightGBM (gradient boosting machine) model trained in each dataset, 
      maintained high sensitivity and achieved 57% specificity in the retrospective 
      validation test and 53% in the prospective study. The number of articles needed 
      to read to find one that met appraisal criteria was 3.68 (95% CI 3.52 to 3.85) in 
      the prospective study, compared with 4.63 (95% CI 4.50 to 4.77) when relying only 
      on Boolean searching. Gradient-boosting ML models reduced the work required to 
      classify high quality clinical research studies by 45%, improving the efficiency 
      of literature surveillance and subsequent dissemination to clinicians and other 
      evidence users.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Encoder-only transformer-based language models have shown promise in 
      automating critical appraisal of clinical literature. However, a comprehensive 
      evaluation of the models for classifying the methodological rigor of randomized 
      controlled trials is necessary to identify the more robust ones. This study 
      benchmarks several state-of-the-art transformer-based language models using a 
      diverse set of performance metrics. METHODS: Seven transformer-based language 
      models were fine-tuned on the title and abstract of 42,575 articles from 2003 to 
      2023 in McMaster University's Premium LiteratUre Service database under different 
      configurations. The studies reported in the articles addressed questions related 
      to treatment, prevention, or quality improvement for which randomized controlled 
      trials are the gold standard with defined criteria for rigorous methods. Models 
      were evaluated on the validation set using 12 schemes and metrics, including 
      optimization for cross-entropy loss, Brier score, AUROC, average precision, 
      sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy, among others. Threshold tuning was 
      performed to optimize threshold-dependent metrics. Models that achieved the best 
      performance in one or more schemes on the validation set were further tested in 
      hold-out and external datasets. RESULTS: A total of 210 models were fine-tuned. 
      Six models achieved top performance in one or more evaluation schemes. Three 
      BioLinkBERT models outperformed others on 8 of the 12 schemes. BioBERT, 
      BiomedBERT, and SciBERT were best on 1, 1 and 2 schemes, respectively. While 
      model performance remained robust on the hold-out test set, it declined in 
      external datasets. Class weight adjustments improved performance in most 
      instances. CONCLUSION: BioLinkBERT generally outperformed the other models. Using 
      comprehensive evaluation metrics and threshold tuning optimizes model selection 
      for real-world applications. Future work should assess generalizability to other 
      datasets, explore alternate imbalance strategies, and examine training on 
      full-text articles.
