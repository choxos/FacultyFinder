TI  - Sequence of a RNA templated by the 3'-OH RNA terminus of defective interfering 
      particles of vesicular stomatitis virus.
PG  - 4704-8
AB  - We have sequenced the endogenous RNA polymerase product produced by disrupted 
      purified virions of vesicular stomatitis virus defective interfering particles by 
      using the newer one-dimensional rapid gel sequencing techniques and confirming 
      this with a modified two-dimensional gel vectoring technique. The sequence of 
      this 46-nucleotide RNA is: 
      5'(pp)pACGAAGACCACAAAACCA-GAUAAAAAAUAAAAACCACAAGAGGG(U)COH3'. We infer that this 
      sequence is identical to the sequence at the 5' end of infectious vesicular 
      stomatitis virus RNA and is complementary to the sequence of the 3'-OH terminus 
      of this defective interfering particle genome RNA.

TI  - Cloning of yeast transfer RNA genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 205-8
AB  - Four thousand Escherichia coli clones containing yeast DNA inserted into the 
      plasmid pBR313 have been isolated. Of these, 175 clones were identified as 
      carrying yeast transfer RNA genes. The initial analysis of the inserted transfer 
      RNA genes via the colony hybridization technique with individual radioactive 
      transfer RNA species is reported. The data indicate that yeast transfer RNA genes 
      are not highly clustered, although some clustering exists. In addition, it was 
      observed that the reiteration number of different transfer RNA genes may vary 
      extensively.

TI  - Cloning of Beneckea genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - Genes from Beneckea harveyi, a luminescent marine bacterium, were cloned in 
      Escherichia coli. This was done by producing randomly sheared fragments of 
      Beneckea DNA and inserting them into the EcoRI site of plasmid pMB9 by the 
      adenine-thymine joining procedure. The hybrid plasmids were used to transform E. 
      coli C600 SF8. Among the transformants selected for tetracycline resistance, one 
      clone that appeared to complement a leucine tb mutation was identified. The 
      transformants were screened for the presence of Beneckea 5S genes. Four of these 
      clones were analyzed in detail by hybridization with 16S, 23S, and 4S Beneckea 
      RNA. The observations suggest that the ribosomal genes in Beneckea are linked, 
      but are present in a different order than those in E. coli.

TI  - Transcription and processing of intervening sequences in yeast tRNA genes.
PG  - 221-36
AB  - Genes for yeast tRNATyr and tRNAPhe have been sequenced (Goodman, Olson and Hall, 
      1977; Valenzuela et al., 1978) which contain additional nucleotides (intervening 
      sequences) within the middle of the gene that are not present in the mature tRNA. 
      We have isolated precursors to rRNATyr and tRNAPhe from a yeast 
      temperature-sensitive mutant (at the rna1 locus) which accumulates only certain 
      precursor tRNAs at the nonpermissive temperature. The tRNATyr and tRNAPhe 
      precursors were analyzed by oligonucleotide mapping; they each contain the 
      intervening sequence and fully matured 5' and 3' termini. Furthermore, these 
      precursors were used as substrates to search for an enzymatic activity which can 
      remove the intervening sequences and religate the ends. We have shown that 
      wild-type yeast contains such an activity, and that this activity specifically 
      removes the intervening sequences to produce mature-sized RNAs.

TI  - The nucleotide sequence of threonine transfer RNA coded by bacteriophage T4.
PG  - 1833-44
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a low molecular weight RNA coded by bacteriophage T4 
      (and previously identified as species alpha) has been determined. The molecule is 
      of particular biological interest for its associated biosynthetic properties. 
      This RNA is 76 nucleotides in length, contains eight modified bases, and can be 
      arranged in a cloverleaf configuration common to tRNAs. The anticodon sequence is 
      UGU, which corresponds to the threonine-specific codons ACA G. The nucleotide 
      sequence was determined primarily by nearest-neighbor analysis of RNA synthesized 
      in vitro using [alpha-32P]nucleoside triphosphates. Using the single-strand 
      specific nuclease S1, two in vivo labeled half-molecules were generated and 
      analysed. This information together with restrictions imposed by nearest-neighbor 
      data, provided a unique linear sequence of nucleotides with the features of 
      secondary structure common to tRNA molecules.

TI  - The regulatory region of the biotin operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - It is proposed that the biotin anabolic operon in Escherichia coli is transcribed 
      divergently from two partially overlapping face-to-face promoters. A mutation 
      that increases transcription in vivo creates an additional promoter in vitro. The 
      putative operator contains an imperfect palindromic sequence that partially 
      overlaps the promoters. The regulatory and genetic implications of these findings 
      are discussed.

AB  - A gene for Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNATrp has been sequenced which contains an 
      intervening sequence of 34 bp (H. S. Kang and J. Abelson, unpublished results). 
      The mutant yeast strain ts-136 accumulates a precursor to tRNATrp which contains 
      mature ends and is colinear with the tRNATrp gene. A nuclear extract from Xenopus 
      oocytes is capable of supporting transcription of the tRNATrp gene contained on 
      plasmid pBR313. The products are precursor tRNAs which contain the intervening 
      RNA sequence. The Xenopus extract accurately splices the precursor transcript to 
      mature-sized tRNATrp.

TI  - Splicing of yeast tRNA precursors: a two-stage reaction.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - Soluble extracts of S. cerevisiae splice tRNA precursors which contain 
      intervening sequences. The reaction goes to completion and requires ATP for the 
      production of mature sequence tRNA. In the absence of ATP, half-tRNA molecules 
      accumulate. Similar half-tRNA molecules appear as kinetic intermediates and 
      accumulate if splicing is inhibited with pure, mature tRNA. Half-tRNA molecules 
      have been purified. These half-tRNAs are efficiently ligated in an ATP-dependent 
      reaction that is inhibited by added mature tRNA. The product of ligation is the 
      expected mature sequence tRNA. The excised intervening sequence has also been 
      identified. These results suggest an enzymatic mechanism for splicing which 
      involves two independent steps.

TI  - Splicing of yeast tRNA precursors: structure of the reaction intermediates.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - The intermediates of the yeast tRNA splicing reaction have been characterized. 
      The intervening sequence is excised as an unique linear molecule. It has 
      5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphate termini. Correspondingly, the half-tRNA molecules 
      are shown to have a 3'-phosphate terminus on the 5' half and 5'-hydroxyl terminus 
      on the 3' half. These isolated halves have been shown to be active in the 
      ligation step of tRNA splicing. Removal of the 3'-phosphate from the 5' half 
      eliminates the ability of the 5' half to participate in ligation.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of an arginine transfer ribonucleic acid from bacteriophage 
      T4.
PG  - 8245-53
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a phage T4-coded low molecular weight RNA, previously 
      designated polyacrylamide gel band epsilon, has been determined. This RNA can be 
      arranged in the cloverleaf configuration common to tRNAs, with an anticodon 
      sequence, U-C-U, which corresponds to the arginine-specific codons A-G-A and 
      A-G-G; it is therefore assumed to be an arginine tRNA. The complete nucleotide 
      sequence of this RNA species is: 
      pG-U-C-C-C-G-C-U-G-G-U-G-U-A-A-U-Gm2'-G-A-D-A-G-C-A-U-A-C-G-A-U-C-C-U-U-C-U-A-A-G-psi-U-U-G-C-G-G-U-C-C-U-G-G-T-psi-C-G-A-U-C-C-C-A-G-G-G-C-G-G-G-A-U-A-C-C-AOH. 
      The nucleotide sequence was determined by analysis of RNA, uniformly labeled in 
      vivo, according to the conventional techniques. In addition, RNA synthesized in 
      vitro in the presence of alpha-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates was analyzed 
      through the use of nearest neighbor sequencing techniques. Although a unique 
      sequence could not be determined by this latter analysis, restrictions on the 
      sequence imposed by nearest neighbor data and secondary structure common to tRNA 
      molecules allowed prediction of the correct nucleotide sequence.

TI  - Cleavage of T4 species I ribonucleic acid by Escherichia coli ribonuclease III.
PG  - 1351-71
AB  - T4 Species I RNA, a molecule 140 nucleotides in length with some structural 
      features very much like a tRNA, is specifically cleaved by an enzymatic activity 
      in Escherichia coli extracts to give three segments with 19, 48 and 73 
      nucleotides. We report the purification and characterization of the E. coli RNase 
      which cleaves two 3' phosphodiester bonds of T4 Species I RNA. This reaction has 
      many properties in common with those catalyzed by E. coli RNase III, although the 
      optimal salt conditions for T4 Species I RNA cleavage differ significantly from 
      those for other RNase III-catalyzed reactions. The reaction is not catalyzed by 
      extracts from an E. coli strain lacking RNase III activity. Furthermore, T4 
      Species I RNA is cleaved by highly purified E. coli RNase III to yield the same 
      three specific fragments. We conclude that this specific cleavage is due to the 
      action of RNase III, and that the requirement for lower ionic strength may reveal 
      further important properties about this RNA processing enzyme.

      The 122 base pairs comprising this region include the recognition sites for RNA 
      polymerase, the positive regulatory protein, CAP, and the negative regulatory 
      protein, the repressor. Identification of mutant variants of the sequence 
      combined with the in vitro biochemical studies of others has allowed us to 
      tentatively identify the recognition site for each of these proteins, and to 
      suggest how CAP might act at a distance to affect the interaction of RNA 
      polymerase with the promoter.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence determination of bacteriophage T4 species I ribonucleic acid.
PG  - 4185-206
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of T4 species I RNA, one of several stable RNA's 
      specifically coded for by bacteriophage T4, has been determined using 
      32-P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of Escherichia coli. The purified 
      RNA species which has been sequenced has been shown to hybridize well to T4 DNA 
      (Wilson J.H., Kim, J.S., and Abelson, J.N. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 71, 547-556). The 
      sequence is:

      Species I RNA which is 140 nucleotides long is also found to occur in shorter 
      versions with 135 to 136 nucleotides which terminate with a 3'-phosphate. The 
      molecule can be arranged in a secondary structure which shows some striking 
      similarities to the classic cloverleaf pattern of a tRNA. The molecule is 
      specifically cleaved by an E. coli nuclease into three segments by cleavage at a 
      double-stranded region in the molecule. The function of species I RNA is unknown, 
      but evidence presented elsewhere (Paddock, G.V., and Abelson, J. (1975) J. Biol. 
      Chem. 250, 4207-4219) indicates that the gene for this RNA molecule has been 
      preserved in evolution. The position of a mutation within species I RNA has been 
      determined. This mutation results in incorrect processing of the RNA and lower 
      relative yields of the RNA are present.

      of Escherichia coli. The T1 and pancreatic ribonuclease digestion products were 
      partially analyzed and the results were compared with nucleotide sequences from 
      T4 species I RNA to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of nucleotide 
      sequence differences among the three species I RNAs. Analysis of fragments 
      obtained by digestion with epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine-41-pancreatic 
      ribonuclease and with E. coli Q13 S30 crude extract was also performed to provide 
      some additional confirmation for the nucleotide sequences that were derived for 
      the T2 and T6 species I RNAs. T2 species I RNA was found to be different at three 
      positions in the nucleotide sequence, and unlike T4 species I RNA, contained in 
      addition the modified nucleotide, psi, in a region where the proposed secondary 
      structure is identical to the TpsiC-loop of a tRNA. T6 species I RNA was found to 
      contain nucleotide differences from the T4 species I RNA sequence at four 
      positions. The U at position 119 in the sequence appears to be modified to psi 
      only to a small extent. While a biological function for species I RNA is unknown, 
      the fact that there is over 97% homology in the sequences suggests strong 
      evolutionary pressures to retain the nucleotide sequence in the T-even genomes.

AB  - The DNA of bacteriophage Mu has been studied to characterize a region of 
      inhomogeneous sequence that occurs at one end of the molecule. The kinetics of 
      reassocation of tracer amounts of labeled host DNA in the presence of Mu DNA show 
      that Mu DNA contains a complete selection of host sequences. These host sequences 
      are shown to be covalently attached to phage-specific sequences and are present 
      at a concentration that accounts for the inhomogeneity observed in the electron 
      microscope. The significance and possible function of the host DNA attachment is 
      discussed.

TI  - Evidence for a base-pairing interaction between U6 small nuclear RNA and 5' 
      splice site during the splicing reaction in yeast.
PG  - 11269-73
AB  - U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is an essential factor in mRNA splicing. On the 
      basis of the high conservation of its sequence, it has been proposed that U6 
      snRNA may function catalytically during the splicing reaction. If this is the 
      case, it is likely that U6 snRNA interacts with the splice sites in the 
      spliceosome to catalyze the reaction. We have used UV crosslinking to analyze the 
      interactions of U6 snRNA with the splicing substrates during the yeast splicing 
      reaction. Crosslinked products in which the central region of U6 snRNA was joined 
      to the 5' splice site region of mRNA precursor and lariat intermediate were 
      identified. The crosslinking sites were precisely located in one of these 
      products. The results suggest a possible base-pairing interaction between U6 
      snRNA and the 5' splice site of the mRNA precursor.

PG  - 18-25
AB  - We examined adrenergic regulation in patients with panic disorder by challenging 
      10 patients and 14 age-matched and sex-matched controls with intravenous 
      infusions of clonidine hydrochloride (2 micrograms/kg), an alpha 2-adrenoreceptor 
      agonist. Growth hormone, 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), blood pressure, 
      heart rate, and behavioral (anxiety, sedation) responses were monitored. The data 
      replicated the previously reported finding of blunted growth hormone (GH) 
      responses to clonidine in patients with panic disorder. Reported abnormalities in 
      MHPG, cardiovascular, and behavioral responses of panic patients to clonidine 
      infusion were not replicated. The robustly blunted GH response to clonidine in 
      panic patients supports the adrenergic dysregulation hypothesis of panic 
      disorder, but alternative interpretations of this finding are available and 
      further study is needed.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the yeast U2 snRNA suggests a structural similarity to the 
      catalytic core of group I introns.
PG  - 819-31
AB  - We have used an in vitro reconstitution system to determine the effects of a 
      large number of mutations in the highly conserved 5' terminal domain of the yeast 
      U2 snRNA on pre-mRNA splicing. Whereas many mutations have little or no 
      functional consequence, base substitutions in two regions were found to have 
      drastic effects on pre-mRNA splicing. A previously unrecognized function for the 
      U2 snRNA in the second step of splicing was found by alteration of the absolutely 
      conserved sequence AGA upstream of the branch point recognition sequence. The 
      effects of these mutations suggest the formation of a structure involving the U2 
      snRNA similar to the guanosine-binding site found in the catalytic core of group 
      I introns.

TI  - Yeast tRNA ligase mutants are nonviable and accumulate tRNA splicing 
      intermediates.
PG  - 4577-82
AB  - We show here that yeast tRNA ligase protein is essential in the cell and 
      participates in joining together tRNA half-molecules resulting from excision of 
      the intron by the splicing endonuclease. A haploid yeast strain carrying a 
      chromosomal deletion of the ligase gene is viable only if ligase protein can be 
      supplied from a plasmid copy of the gene. When synthesis of the plasmid-borne 
      ligase gene is repressed, cells eventually die and accumulate endonuclease cut 
      but unligated half-molecules and intervening sequences. Half-molecules that 
      accumulate appear to be fully end-processed. Two temperature-sensitive ligase 
      mutant strains have been isolated; these strains accumulate a similar set of 
      unligated half-molecules at the nonpermissive temperature.

TI  - Thiophosphates in yeast U6 snRNA specifically affect pre-mRNA splicing in vitro.
PG  - 3659-64
AB  - A thorough mutational analysis of U6 RNA in combination with a functional 
      reconstitution assay, revealed that three domains are important for U6 function 
      in pre-mRNA splicing. In order to further analyze why these regions are so 
      critical for splicing, we make use of phosphorothioate substituted U6 RNAs. 
      Wild-type U6 RNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence 
      of either phosphorothiate (alpha-S) ATP, GTP, UTP or CTP. The functionality of 
      the transcripts was monitored by in vitro reconstitution. While substitution with 
      alpha-S ATP, GTP or UTP blocked splicing, substitution with alpha-S CTP had 
      little or no effect on splicing. We made use of this alpha-S CTP effect in an 
      attempt to elucidate which phosphates in the U6 RNA molecule play a role in the 
      first or in the second step of splicing. U6 mutants in which a change of an A, G 
      or U to C does not have any significant effect on splicing were transcribed in 
      the presence of alpha-S CTP. Observed effects on splicing thus have to be 
      attributed to the presence of the thio-substituted phosphate group rather than 
      the nucleotide change. The results of in vitro reconstitution give a clear answer 
      for at least three phosphates; two of them play a role in the first step, while 
      one of them is involved in the second step of splicing.

TI  - Affinity chromatography with biotinylated RNAs.
PG  - 97-121
AB  - Small, reversibly biotinylated RNAs as described here are versatile ligands for 
      affinity chromatography of RNA-binding components. These RNAs can be attached to 
      a solid support by binding to avidin and used as ligands, or they may be 
      hybridized to another RNA which acts as the ligand. The incorporation of a 
      disulfide bond in the linker arm connecting biotin to the RNA makes it possible 
      to dissociate the RNA from avidin under mild conditions. Our results regarding 
      the binding and elution of the biotinylated RNA may be applied to other, 
      reversibly biotinylated molecules.

TI  - An essential 45 kDa yeast transmembrane protein reacts with anti-nuclear pore 
      antibodies: purification of the protein, immunolocalization and cloning of the 
      gene.
PG  - 8-18
AB  - A yeast membrane protein was isolated by its binding to tRNA Sepharose column. 
      The 45 kDa protein shares characteristics with rat liver nuclear pore proteins in 
      having reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (RL1) raised against rat liver 
      nuclear pore proteins and by the binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), 
      indicating the presence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties. 
      Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation experiments indicate that 
      the protein is located in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum of 
      the cell. The gene for the 45 kDa protein was cloned using degenerate 
      oligonucleotides derived from the N-terminal protein sequence and confirmed by 
      internal peptide sequences. The gene was named WBP1. The protein coding sequence 
      of the WBP1 gene reveals an ER entry signal peptide and a C-terminal membrane 
      spanning domain. Topological studies indicate that the C-terminus of the protein 
      is located in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic tail of the protein contains the 
      K-K-X-X signal known to be sufficient for retention of transmembrane proteins in 
      higher eukaryotic cells. Gene disruption experiments show that the 45 kDa protein 
      is essential for the vegetative life cycle of the yeast cell.

TI  - Deletion analysis of a multifunctional yeast tRNA ligase polypeptide. 
      Identification of essential and dispensable functional domains.
PG  - 7445-55
AB  - Splicing of tRNA precursors in extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the 
      action of two enzymes: a site specific endonuclease and a tRNA ligase. The tRNA 
      ligase contains three distinct enzymatic activities: a polynucleotide kinase, a 
      cyclic phosphodiesterase, and an RNA ligase. The polypeptide also has a high 
      affinity pre-tRNA binding site based on its ability to form stable complexes with 
      pre-tRNA substrates. To investigate the organization of functional enzymatic and 
      binding elements within the polypeptide a series of defined tRNA ligase gene 
      deletions were constructed and corresponding proteins were expressed in 
      Escherichia coli as fusions with bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The 
      DHFR/ligase derivative proteins were then efficiently purified by affinity 
      chromatography. The complete ligase fusion protein retained enzymatic and binding 
      activities which were unaffected by the presence of the DHFR segment. Examination 
      of tRNA ligase deletion derivatives revealed that the amino-terminal region was 
      required for adenylylation, while the carboxyl-terminal region was sufficient for 
      cyclic phosphodiesterase activity. Deletions within the central region affected 
      kinase activity. Pre-tRNA binding activity was not strictly correlated with a 
      distinct enzymatic domain. A DHFR/ligase-derived protein lacking kinase activity 
      efficiently joined tRNA halves. We postulate that this variant utilizes a novel 
      RNA ligation mechanism.

TI  - Blunted growth hormone response to clonidine in patients with generalized anxiety 
      disorder.
PG  - 157-62
AB  - Patients with panic disorder or depression have abnormal responses to the alpha 
      2-adrenergic receptor partial agonist clonidine. Evidence linking anxiety to 
      noradrenergic dysfunction and the presence of anxiety symptoms in both depression 
      and panic suggest that abnormal responses to clonidine in these disorders could 
      be due to the anxiety symptoms. To explore a possible link between "nonspecific" 
      anxiety symptoms and abnormal responses to clonidine, patients with 
      DSM-III-defined generalized anxiety disorder were given intravenous infusions of 
      clonidine hydrochloride. Responses of plasma growth hormone, 
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, heart rate, blood pressure, and psychological 
      states were determined in 11 patients with generalized anxiety disorder and 14 
      healthy subjects. Clonidine produced significantly smaller growth hormone 
      responses in patients than in healthy controls. The two groups did not differ in 
      3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, heart rate, blood pressure, or psychological 
      responses to clonidine. These results are compared with data from similar studies 
      on patients with panic disorder and depression. The blunting of the growth 
      hormone response to clonidine in all three disorders could be due to the presence 
      of generalized anxiety symptoms. Subsensitivity of postsynaptic alpha 
      2-adrenoreceptors may be present in all three disorders; however, there are 
      alternative interpretations of growth hormone blunting in response to clonidine. 
      Blunting was observed in DSM-III-defined generalized anxiety disorder, whether or 
      not the DSM-III-R criterion of excessive worry was also present.

TI  - Requirement of the RNA helicase-like protein PRP22 for release of messenger RNA 
      from spliceosomes.
PG  - 487-93
AB  - The product of the yeast PRP22 gene acts late in the splicing of yeast 
      pre-messenger RNA, mediating the release of the spliced mRNA from the 
      spliceosome. The predicted PRP22 protein sequence shares extensive homology with 
      that of PRP2 and PRP16 proteins, which are also involved in nuclear pre-mRNA 
      splicing. The homologous region contains sequence elements characteristic of 
      several demonstrated or putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. A putative 
      RNA-binding motif originally identified in bacterial ribosomal protein S1 and 
      Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase has also been found in PRP22.

TI  - SSB-1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nucleolar-specific, 
      silver-binding protein that is associated with the snR10 and snR11 small nuclear 
      RNAs.
PG  - 1741-51
AB  - SSB-1, the yeast single-strand RNA-binding protein, is demonstrated to be a yeast 
      nucleolar-specific, silver-binding protein. In double-label immunofluorescence 
      microscopy experiments antibodies to two other nucleolar proteins, RNA Pol I 
      190-kD and fibrillarin, were used to reveal the site of rRNA transcription; i.e., 
      the fibrillar region of the nucleolus. SSB-1 colocalized with fibrillarin in a 
      double-label immunofluorescence mapping experiment to the yeast nucleolus. SSB-1 
      is located, though, over a wider region of the nucleolus than the transcription 
      site marker. Immunoprecipitations of yeast cell extracts with the SSB-1 antibody 
      reveal that in 150 mM NaCl SSB-1 is bound to two small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). 
      These yeast snRNAs are snR10 and snR11, with snR10 being predominant. Since snR10 
      has been implicated in pre-rRNA processing, the association of SSB-1 and snR10 
      into a nucleolar snRNP particle indicates SSB-1 involvement in rRNA processing as 
      well. Also, another yeast protein, SSB-36-kD, isolated by single-strand DNA 
      chromatography, is shown to bind silver under the conditions used for 
      nucleolar-specific staining. It is, most likely, another yeast nucleolar protein.

TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. III. Determination 
      of tRNA specificity.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we have constructed a collection of Escherichia 
      coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. In order to determine their specificities, 
      these tRNAs were each used to suppress an amber (UAG) nonsense mutation in the E. 
      coli dihydrofolate reductase gene fol. The mutant proteins were purified and 
      subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis to determine which amino acid had been 
      inserted by the suppressor tRNAs at the position of the amber codon. The 
      suppressors can be classified into three groups on the basis of the protein 
      sequence information. Class I suppressors, tRNA(CUAAla2), tRNA(CUAGly1), 
      tRNA(CUAHisA), tRNA(CUALys) and tRNA(CUAProH), inserted the predicted amino acid. 
      The class II suppressors, tRNA(CUAGluA), tRNA(CUAGly2) and tRNA(CUAIle1) were 
      either partially or predominantly mischarged by the glutamine aminoacyl tRNA 
      synthetase. The class III suppressors, tRNA(CUAArg), tRNA(CUAAspM), 
      tRNA(CUAIle2), tRNA(CUAThr2), tRNA(CUAMet(m)) and tRNA(CUAVal) inserted 
      predominantly lysine.

TI  - Domains of yeast U4 spliceosomal RNA required for PRP4 protein binding, 
      snRNP-snRNP interactions, and pre-mRNA splicing in vivo.
PG  - 1185-96
AB  - U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) contains two intramolecular stem-loop structures, 
      located near each end of the molecule. The 5' stem-loop is highly conserved in 
      structure and separates two regions of U4 snRNA that base-pair with U6 snRNA in 
      the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP). The 3' stem-loop is 
      highly divergent in structure among species and lies immediately upstream of the 
      binding site for Sm proteins. To investigate the function of these two domains, 
      mutants were constructed that delete the yeast U4 snRNA 5' stem-loop and that 
      replace the yeast 3' stem-loop with that from trypanosome U4 snRNA. Both mutants 
      fail to complement a null allele of the yeast U4 gene. The defects of the mutants 
      have been examined in heterozygous strains by native gel electrophoresis, 
      glycerol gradient centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation. The chimeric 
      yeast-trypanosome RNA does not associate efficiently with U6 snRNA, suggesting 
      that the 3' stem-loop of yeast U4 snRNA might be a binding site for a putative 
      protein that facilitates assembly of the U4/U6 complex. In contrast, the 5' 
      hairpin deletion mutant associates efficiently with U6 snRNA. However, it does 
      not bind the U4/U6-specific protein PRP4 and does not assemble into a U4/U5/U6 
      snRNA. Thus, we propose that the role of the PRP4 protein is to promote 
      interactions between the U4/U6 snRNP and the U5 snRNP.

TI  - Two domains of yeast U6 small nuclear RNA required for both steps of nuclear 
      precursor messenger RNA splicing.
PG  - 404-9
AB  - U6 is one of the five small nuclear RNA's (snRNA's) that are required for 
      splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). The size and sequence of 
      U6 RNA are conserved among organisms as diverse as yeast and man, and so it has 
      been proposed that U6 RNA functions as a catalytic element in splicing. A 
      procedure for in vitro reconstitution of functional yeast U6 small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) with synthetic U6 RNA was applied in an attempt to 
      elucidate the function of yeast U6 RNA. Two domains in U6 RNA were identified, 
      each of which is required for in vitro splicing. Single nucleotide substitutions 
      in these two domains block splicing either at the first or the second step. 
      Invariably, U6 RNA mutants that block the first step of splicing do not enter the 
      spliceosome. On the other hand, those that block the second step of splicing form 
      a spliceosome but block cleavage at the 3' splice site of the intron. In both 
      domains, the positions of base changes that block the second step of splicing 
      correspond exactly to the site of insertion of pre-mRNA-type introns into the U6 
      gene of two yeast species, providing a possible explanation for the mechanism of 
      how these introns originated and adding further evidence for the proposed 
      catalytic role of U6 RNA.

TI  - Alpha 2-adrenoreceptor status in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 1083-93
AB  - Ten patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and 13 normal control 
      subjects received intravenous infusions of 2 X 10(-6) g/kg of clonidine and 
      normal saline on separate days. Responses to the drug relating to plasma growth 
      hormone (GH), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), heart rate, blood pressure, 
      and several symptoms were determined. Additionally, platelet alpha 
      2-adrenoreceptor binding was measured in most of the subjects. GH, MHPG, blood 
      pressure, and heart rate responses to clonidine did not differ between groups. As 
      expected, patients reported more symptoms than normal subjects, and clonidine was 
      sedating for both groups. Patients did not differ from normal subjects in the 
      symptom response to clonidine. The maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for 
      tritiated clonidine was significantly greater in OCD patients than in normals. 
      This pattern of alpha 2-adrenoreceptor status is different than the patterns in 
      major depression and panic anxiety.

TI  - Accumulation of pre-tRNA splicing '2/3' intermediates in a Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae mutant.
PG  - 1245-52
AB  - In an effort to identify genes involved in the excision of tRNA introns in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, temperature-sensitive mutants were screened for 
      intracellular accumulation of intron-containing tRNA precursors by RNA 
      hybridization analysis. In one mutant, tRNA splicing intermediates consisting of 
      the 5' exon covalently joined to the intron ('2/3' pre-tRNA molecules) were 
      detected in addition to unspliced precursors. The mutant cleaves pre-tRNA(Phe) in 
      vitro at the 3' exon/intron splice site, generating the 3' half molecule and 2/3 
      intermediate. The 5' half molecule and intron are not produced, indicating that 
      cleavage at the 5' splice site is suppressed. This partial splicing activity 
      co-purifies with tRNA endonuclease throughout several chromatographic steps. 
      Surprisingly, the splicing defect does not appreciably affect cell growth at 
      normal or elevated temperatures, but does confer a pseudo cold-sensitive 
      phenotype of retarded growth at 15 degrees C. The mutant falls into the 
      complementation group SEN2 previously defined by the isolation of mutants 
      defective for tRNA splicing in vitro [Winey, M. and Culbertson, M.R. (1988) 
      Genetics, 118, 609-617], although its phenotypes are distinct from those of the 
      previous sen2 isolates. The distinguishing genetic and biochemical properties of 
      this new allele, designated sen2-3, suggests the direct participation of the SEN2 
      gene product in tRNA endonuclease function.

TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. II. Synthesis of 
      additional tRNA genes and improvement of suppressor efficiency.
PG  - 705-17
AB  - Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we have constructed 17 tRNA suppressor genes 
      from Escherichia coli representing 13 species of tRNA. We have measured the 
      levels of in vivo suppression resulting from introducing each tRNA gene into E. 
      coli via a plasmid vector. The suppressors function at varying efficiencies. Some 
      synthetic suppressors fail to yield detectable levels of suppression, whereas 
      others insert amino acids with greater than 70% efficiency. Results reported in 
      the accompanying paper demonstrate that some of these suppressors insert the 
      original cognate amino acid, whereas others do not. We have altered some of the 
      synthetic tRNA genes in order to improve the suppressor efficiency of the 
      resulting tRNAs. Both tRNA(CUAHis) and tRNA(CUAGlu) were altered by single base 
      changes, which generated -A-A- following the anticodon, resulting in a markedly 
      improved efficiency of suppression. The tRNA(CUAPro) was inactive, but a hybrid 
      suppressor tRNA consisting of the tRNA(CUAPhe) anticodon stem and loop together 
      with the remainder of the tRNA(Pro) proved highly efficient at suppressing 
      nonsense codons. Protein chemistry results reported in the accompanying paper 
      show that the altered tRNA(CUAHis) and the hybrid tRNA(CUAPro) insert only 
      histidine and proline, respectively, whereas the altered tRNA(CUAGlu) inserts 
      principally glutamic acid but some glutamine. Also, a strain deficient in release 
      factor I was employed to increase the efficiency of weak nonsense suppressors.

      nucleotidyltransferase in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 16216-20
AB  - We have isolated a yeast mutant, ts352, that is temperature-sensitive for growth. 
      The mutation has a general effect on mRNA metabolism and a specific effect on 
      tRNA biosynthesis. Cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature accumulate 
      tRNAs that are shorter than mature tRNAs. The increased ability of these tRNAs to 
      accept ATP demonstrates that growth of the ts352 mutant at the nonpermissive 
      temperature results in accumulation of tRNA with defective 3' ends. The activity 
      of ATP (CTP):tRNA-specific tRNA nucleotidyltransferase can readily be measured in 
      extracts from wild type but not mutant cells. We have cloned and sequenced the 
      wild type allele of the ts352 gene and find significant similarity between the 
      yeast protein sequence predicted from the DNA sequence and the protein predicted 
      from the sequence of the Escherichi coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase gene. 
      Expression of the yeast gene on a multicopy plasmid increases the activity of the 
      tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in extracts. We conclude that the defect in the ts352 
      mutant is in the gene coding for yeast tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and that we 
      have isolated the yeast gene that codes for this enzyme.

TI  - Domain structure in yeast tRNA ligase.
PG  - 6132-8
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase is one of two proteins required for the splicing of precursor 
      tRNA molecules containing introns. The 95-kDa tRNA ligase has been purified to 
      homogeneity from a strain of Escherichia coli which overexpresses the protein. 
      The ligation reaction requires three enzymatic activities: phosphodiesterase, 
      polynucleotide kinase, and ligase. By partial proteolytic digestion, we have 
      produced fragments of tRNA ligase which contain the constituent activities. These 
      results provide evidence for a model in which the three constituent activities of 
      ligase are located in three distinct domains separated by protease-sensitive 
      regions. We have also located the active adenylylated site in the ligase domains. 
      It is lysine-114. The tRNA ligase sequence in this region has limited homology to 
      the active-site region of T4 RNA ligase.

TI  - Yeast tRNA-splicing endonuclease is a heterotrimeric enzyme.
PG  - 18180-4
AB  - tRNA-splicing endonuclease from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was purified 
      to homogeneity greater than 5000-fold over a crude Triton X-100 extract of yeast 
      total membranes, with 5% overall yield. This nuclear enzyme has the unusual 
      heterotrimeric subunit structure alpha beta gamma (alpha = 31 kDa, beta = 42 kDa, 
      and gamma = 51 kDa), as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, 
      and has a molecular mass close to the sum of the three subunits, as determined by 
      gel filtration of the native enzyme. From the purification, we estimate that 
      there are approximately 100 molecules of endonuclease/cell.

TI  - A yeast mutant, PRP20, altered in mRNA metabolism and maintenance of the nuclear 
      structure, is defective in a gene homologous to the human gene RCC1 which is 
      involved in the control of chromosome condensation.
PG  - 72-80
AB  - We report on the characterization of the yeast prp20-1 mutant. In this 
      temperature-sensitive mutant, multiple steps of mRNA metabolism are affected. The 
      prp20-1 mutant strain showed alterations in mRNA steady-state levels, defective 
      mRNA splicing and changes in transcription initiation or termination when shifted 
      from the permissive to the non-permissive temperature. In addition, a change in 
      the structure of the nucleus in these cells became apparent. Electron microscopy 
      revealed an altered structure of the nucleoplasm of prp20-1 mutant cells when 
      grown at the non-permissive temperature that was not observed in cells grown at 
      the permissive temperature or in wild-type cells. The wild-type PRP20 gene was 
      isolated and sequenced. The putative PRP20 protein has a molecular weight of 52 
      kDa. We found that the PRP20 gene is identical to the yeast SRM1 gene (Clark and 
      Sprague 1989). In addition, the PRP20 protein sequence shows significant sequence 
      similarity to the human RCC1 protein (Ohtsubo et al. 1987). This protein has been 
      implicated in the control of chromosome condensation. Based on the phenotype of 
      the prp20-1 mutant and the observed sequence similarity to the human RCC1 
      protein, we postulate that the yeast PRP20 protein is involved in the control of 
      nuclear organization.

TI  - Do health service organizations and community health centres have higher disease 
      prevention and health promotion levels than fee-for-service practices?
PG  - 575-81
AB  - We interviewed health care providers representing 23 fee-for-service (FFS) 
      practices, 19 health service organizations (HSOs) and 11 community health centres 
      (CHCs) in Ontario to compare self-reported approaches to disease prevention and 
      health promotion. Few significant differences were found across practice types in 
      the presence of recall systems for screening or in knowledge of, compliance with 
      or estimated coverage for selected preventive maneuvers recommended by the 
      Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. CHCs reported a 
      significantly greater variety of formal health promotion programs and a greater 
      tendency to use nonphysician health care personnel to carry out both prevention 
      and health promotion activities. The results must be interpreted with caution 
      because of the use of self-reported data, the low response rate for FFS practices 
      and the use of a restrictive definition of disease prevention tied to evidence 
      from the reports of the task force. Thus, the results cast some doubt on the 
      common assumption that increasing the population served by alternative modes of 
      delivery such as HSOs and CHCs necessarily increases the level of disease 
      prevention and health promotion activity.

TI  - Sources of discrepancy in the comparison of a lay-administered diagnostic 
      instrument with clinical diagnosis.
PG  - 145-59
AB  - This article presents a comparison of the diagnostic results from a 
      lay-administered diagnostic interview for depression with a clinical diagnosis in 
      a community sample. The purpose of the comparison is to assess reasons for the 
      discrepancies between the two diagnostic approaches. The majority of the 
      discrepancies result from inconsistent episode reports at the two interviews. We 
      propose a number of possible explanations for the inconsistencies. An empirical 
      analysis that identifies predictors of consistent vs. inconsistent reports 
      supports a strong influence for respondent recall error. We discuss the 
      implications of our analysis for previous comparisons of lay-administered and 
      clinical diagnostic instruments.

TI  - Treatment of panic-like attacks with a long-acting analogue of somatostatin.
PG  - 128-32
AB  - Psychiatric evaluations were completed on four patients who were treated for 
      "idiopathic flushing" with a long-acting analogue of somatostatin. All four 
      patients had symptom profiles consistent with a diagnosis of panic disorder. All 
      four experienced clinically significant relief from panic-like attacks while on 
      the experimental medication. These findings suggest a possible role for 
      somatostatin in the pathophysiology and treatment of panic disorder.

TI  - PRP5: a helicase-like protein required for mRNA splicing in yeast.
PG  - 4236-40
AB  - A 96-kDa protein predicted by the DNA sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      PRP5 gene contains a domain that bears a striking resemblance to a family of RNA 
      helicases characterized by the conserved amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp 
      (D-E-A-D). Previous work indicated that the product of the PRP5 gene is required 
      for splicing and that spliceosome assembly does not occur in its absence. 
      However, its precise role in splicing and the nature of its biochemical activity 
      remained unknown. To examine the role of PRP5 in splicing, we cloned the gene by 
      complementation of a temperature-sensitive mutation and determined its DNA 
      sequence. We discuss here the possible roles for an RNA helicase in splicing and 
      for the activity of the PRP5 protein.

TI  - PRP18, a protein required for the second reaction in pre-mRNA splicing.
PG  - 324-32
AB  - We have investigated the role of a novel temperature-sensitive splicing mutation, 
      prp18. We had previously demonstrated that an accumulation of the lariat 
      intermediate of splicing occurred at the restrictive temperature in vivo. We have 
      now used the yeast in vitro splicing system to show that extracts from this 
      mutant strain are heat labile for the second reaction of splicing. The heat 
      inactivation of prp18 extracts results from loss of activity of an exchangeable 
      component. Inactivated prp18 extracts are complemented by heat-inactivated 
      extracts from other mutants or by fractions from wild-type extracts. In 
      heat-inactivated prp18 extracts, 40S splicing complexes containing lariat 
      intermediate and exon 1 can assemble. The intermediates in this 40S complex can 
      be chased to products by complementing extracts in the presence of ATP. Both 
      complementation of extracts and chasing of the isolated prp18 spliceosomes takes 
      place with micrococcal nuclease-treated extracts. Furthermore, the 
      complementation profile with fractions of wild-type extracts indicates that the 
      splicing defect results from a mutation in a previously designated factor 
      required for the second step of splicing. The isolation of this mutant as 
      temperature-sensitive lethal has also facilitated cloning of the wild-type allele 
      by complementation.

TI  - Identification of five putative yeast RNA helicase genes.
PG  - 1571-5
AB  - The RNA helicase gene family encodes a group of eight homologous proteins that 
      share regions of sequence similarity. This group of evolutionarily conserved 
      proteins presumably all utilize ATP (or some other nucleoside triphosphate) as an 
      energy source for unwinding double-stranded RNA. Members of this family have been 
      implicated in a variety of physiological functions in organisms ranging from 
      Escherichia coli to human, such as translation initiation, mitochondrial mRNA 
      splicing, ribosomal assembly, and germinal line cell differentiation. We have 
      applied polymerase chain reaction technology to search for additional members of 
      the RNA helicase family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using degenerate 
      oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify DNA fragments flanked by the highly 
      conserved motifs V L D E A D and Y I H R I G, we have detected five putative RNA 
      helicase genes. Northern and Southern blot analyses demonstrated that these genes 
      are single copy and expressed in yeast. Several members of the RNA helicase 
      family share sequence identity ranging from 49.2% to 67.2%, suggesting that they 
      are functionally related. The discovery of such a multitude of putative RNA 
      helicase genes in yeast suggests that RNA helicase activities are involved in a 
      variety of fundamentally important biological processes.

TI  - Protein engineering with synthetic Escherichia coli amber suppressor genes.
PG  - 905-8
AB  - We have constructed synthetic genes encoding different Escherichia coli 
      suppressor tRNAs for use in amino acid substitution studies and protein 
      engineering. We used oligonucleotides to assemble the genes for different tRNAs 
      with the anticodon 5' CTA 3'. The suppressor genes are expressed from a synthetic 
      promoter derived from the promoter sequence of the E. coli lipoprotein gene. The 
      genes have been used to suppress an amber mutation in a protein coding sequence, 
      and the resulting altered protein has been subjected to sequence analysis to 
      determine the nature of the amino acid inserted at the amber site. Twelve amino 
      acids can now be added in response to the amber codon. We have employed these 
      suppressors to study amino acid substitutions in the lac repressor.

TI  - PRP4: a protein of the yeast U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle.
PG  - 3710-9
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae prp mutants (prp2 through prp11) are known to be 
      defective in pre-mRNA splicing at nonpermissive temperatures. We have sequenced 
      the PRP4 gene and shown that it encodes a 52-kilodalton protein. We obtained PRP4 
      protein-specific antibodies and found that they inhibited in vitro pre-mRNA 
      splicing, which confirms the essential role of PRP4 in splicing. Moreover, we 
      found that PRP4 is required early in the spliceosome assembly pathway. 
      Immunoprecipitation experiments with anti-PRP4 antibodies were used to 
      demonstrate that PRP4 is a protein of the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 
      particle (snRNP). Furthermore, the U5 snRNP could be immunoprecipitated through 
      snRNP-snRNP interactions in the large U4/U5/U6 complex.

TI  - In vitro reconstitution of functional yeast U2 snRNPs.
PG  - 2124-36
AB  - A system for the functional reconstitution of yeast U2 snRNPs using synthetic U2 
      RNAs is described. We use oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage to 
      specifically deplete yeast extracts of their endogenous full-length U2 snRNA and 
      consequently inactivate pre-mRNA splicing activity. The subsequent addition of 
      synthetic yeast U2 RNAs, derived by in vitro transcription (T7U2 RNAs), to these 
      oligonucleotide-treated extracts efficiently reconstitutes their ability to 
      splice pre-mRNA. The use of deletion derivatives of the T7U2 RNA has demonstrated 
      that the region downstream from the conserved Sm-binding site sequence in the 
      yeast U2 RNA is not absolutely required for pre-mRNA splicing activity in vitro. 
      Furthermore, we found that both human and rat U2 RNAs can function in yeast 
      extracts. We also show that point mutations in the yeast U2 RNA can be analyzed 
      using the in vitro reconstitution system. Allele-specific suppression of 
      mutations in pre-mRNA branch site sequence is observed when the appropriate 
      compensatory mutations in the branch site recognition region of the T7U2 RNA are 
      introduced. Finally, we present a model for the interaction of the U2 and U6 
      snRNAs during pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - In vitro assembly of yeast U6 snRNP: a functional assay.
PG  - 2137-50
AB  - U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is the most highly conserved spliceosomal RNA, and 
      it has been postulated to have a fundamental role in pre-mRNA splicing. To 
      elucidate this role, we developed an in vitro system for reconstituting the 
      functional U6 small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Treating splicing extracts with an 
      oligonucleotide complementary to the central domain of U6 snRNA leads to both 
      RNase H cleavage of the endogenous U6 snRNA and loss of splicing activity. Yeast 
      U6 RNA, synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, is then added to the 
      oligonucleotide-treated extract, and restoration of splicing activity is 
      monitored by the subsequent addition of substrate pre-mRNA. Addition of 
      full-length, unmodified T7U6 snRNA (113 nucleotides) to oligonucleotide-treated 
      extracts restores splicing activity efficiently. Using U6 RNA transcripts 
      truncated at their 3' ends, we show that large deletions (39 nucleotides) produce 
      molecules that are unable to restore splicing activity in vitro and cannot 
      interact with the endogenous U4 snRNA or form a mature spliceosome. Finally, we 
      show that substitution of the invariant G81 with C within the T7U6 RNA abolishes 
      its ability of restoring splicing activity. Although the U4/U6 snRNP forms 
      correctly, mature spliceosomes do not assemble.

      therapy and at follow-up. Both subjects showed rising cortisol responses and 
      stable, non-extinguishing norepinephrine responses to height exposure over the 
      course of treatment, while improvement occurred in subjective and behavioral 
      response systems. They had differing heart rate responses. Despite desynchrony 
      amongst anxiety response systems and within the physiological 'system' at 
      treatment conclusion, both subjects had successful outcomes which were preserved 
      at follow-up. Implications for the measurement of the 'physiological response 
      system' in behavioral research are discussed.

AB  - In this study we report the isolation of temperature-sensitive mutants that 
      affect pre-mRNA splicing. A bank of approximately 1000 temperature-sensitive 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was generated and screened on RNA gel blots by 
      hybridization with an actin intron probe. We isolated 16 mutants defining 11 new 
      complementation groups prp(rna)17-prp(rna)27 with four phenotypic classes of 
      mutants and 21 mutants in the prp2-prp11 complementation groups (formerly 
      rna2-rna11). The majority of the complementation groups share a phenotype of 
      pre-mRNA accumulation, seen in all of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 mutants. Three 
      novel classes of mutants were isolated in this study. One class, consisting of 
      two complementation groups, exhibits an accumulation of the lariat intermediate 
      of splicing, with no change in the levels of pre-mRNA. The second class, also 
      represented by two complementation groups, shows an accumulation of the intron 
      released after splicing. The third novel class, comprising one complementation 
      group, accumulates both pre-mRNA and the released intron. All mutants isolated 
      were recessive for the splicing phenotype. Only 2 of the 11 complementation 
      groups, although recessive, were not temperature sensitive. This study, together 
      with previous isolation of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 groups and the spliceosomal 
      snRNAs, puts at least 26 gene products involved directly or indirectly in 
      pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - A synthetic substrate for tRNA splicing.
PG  - 90-106
AB  - A novel method for the synthesis of precursor tRNA as substrate for in vitro 
      splicing is reported. A construct consisting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      pre-tRNAPhe gene under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter was assembled 
      from a set of synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into an M13 vector. By the 
      use of T7 RNA polymerase, BstNI-runoff transcripts were produced. The resulting 
      pre-tRNA was shown to possess mature termini and was accurately spliced by highly 
      purified yeast tRNA-splicing endonuclease and ligase. Using this synthetic 
      pre-tRNA, the kinetic parameters of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease were also 
      determined. Use of this system provides several advantages for the study of 
      tRNA-splicing mechanisms. Mutant tRNA precursors can be readily synthesized. It 
      is also possible to synthesize large quantities of pre-tRNA for structural 
      studies.

TI  - Binding interactions between yeast tRNA ligase and a precursor transfer 
      ribonucleic acid containing two photoreactive uridine analogues.
PG  - 8852-61
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is one of the protein 
      components that is involved in the splicing reaction of intron-containing yeast 
      precursor tRNAs. It is an unusual protein because it has three distinct catalytic 
      activities. It functions as a polynucleotide kinase, as a cyclic 
      phosphodiesterase, and as an RNA ligase. We have studied the binding interactions 
      between ligase and precursor tRNAs containing two photoreactive uridine 
      analogues, 4-thiouridine and 5-bromouridine. When irradiated with long 
      ultraviolet light, RNA containing these analogues can form specific covalent 
      bonds with associated proteins. In this paper, we show that 4-thiouridine 
      triphosphate and 5-bromouridine triphosphate were readily incorporated into a 
      precursor tRNA(Phe) that was synthesized, in vitro, with bacteriophage T7 RNA 
      polymerase. The analogue-containing precursor tRNAs were authentic substrates for 
      the two splicing enzymes that were tested (endonuclease and ligase), and they 
      formed specific covalent bonds with ligase when they were irradiated with 
      long-wavelength ultraviolet light. We have determined the position of three major 
      cross-links and one minor cross-link on precursor tRNA(Phe) that were located 
      within the intron and near the 3' splice site. On the basis of these data, we 
      present a model for the in vivo splicing reaction of yeast precursor tRNAs.

TI  - Spliceosome assembly in yeast.
PG  - 1014-27
AB  - Precursors to mRNA become substrates for splicing by being assembled into a 
      complex multisubunit structure, the spliceosome. To study the assembly of the 
      yeast spliceosome, intermediate complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 
      nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Four splicing-dependent complexes, A1, A2-1, 
      A2-2, and B, were observed. The order of assembly of these complexes was 
      determined to be B----A2-1----A1----A2-2. The assembly process can be blocked at 
      complex A1 by addition of 5 mM EDTA or by carrying out the assembly process in 
      heat-inactivated rna2 extracts. The snRNA composition of the complexes was 
      determined by hybridization with probes for five yeast snRNAs. snR14 (U4) was 
      only found in complex A2-1, snR6 (U6) and snR7 (U5) were in complexes A1, A2-1, 
      and A2-2, whereas snR20 (U2) was in all four of the complexes. snR19 (U1) was not 
      present in any of the complexes. Hybridization with these probes was also 
      employed to detect snRNPs present in yeast splicing extracts. We found that snR6, 
      snR7, and snR14 were present together in a large complex. This complex underwent 
      an ATP-dependent dissociation to give snR7 and snR6-snR14 complexes. snR19 and 
      snR20 are present in distinct RNPs but the mobility of these is not affected by 
      ATP. A mechanism for spliceosome assembly is proposed.

TI  - An early hierarchic role of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein in spliceosome 
      assembly.
PG  - 1028-35
AB  - Splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) occurs on a large 
      ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome. Several small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) are subunits of this complex that assembles on the 
      pre-mRNA. Although the U1 snRNP is known to recognize the 5' splice site, its 
      roles in spliceosome formation and splice site alignment have been unclear. A new 
      affinity purification method for the spliceosome is described which has provided 
      insight into the very early stages of spliceosome formation in a yeast in vitro 
      splicing system. Surprisingly, the U1 snRNP initially recognizes sequences at or 
      near both splice junctions in the intron. This interaction must occur before the 
      other snRNP's (U2, U4, U5, and U6) can join the complex. The results suggest that 
      interaction of the two splice site regions occurs at an early stage of 
      spliceosome formation and is probably mediated by U1 snRNP and perhaps other 
      factors.

TI  - Nucleolytic processing of a tRNAArg-tRNAAsp dimeric precursor by a homologous 
      component from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1271-9
AB  - A subcellular extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to transcribe 
      cloned yeast tRNA genes in vitro and to process the primary transcripts at the 5' 
      and 3' termini. Chromatographic fractionation of the extract has separated the 
      transcription components from two distinct nucleolytic activities: an 
      endonuclease that cleaves the precursors to produce mature 5' termini; and a 
      3'-5' exonuclease. These fractions have been used to elaborate a processing 
      pathway for the dimeric primary transcript of the yeast tRNAArg-tRNAAsp gene 
      pair. Under optimal conditions in vitro this gene is expressed at a rate of 200 
      transcripts/gene/hour, initiating at position -10 with respect to the mature 5' 
      terminus of tRNAArg and terminating near position +160. The primary transcripts 
      are cleaved by an endonuclease to give tRNAAsp with a mature 5' terminus, and a 
      pre-tRNAArg monomer with a 5' leader and 3' trailer sequences. A second 
      endonuclease cleavage of pre-tRNAArg generates the mature 5' terminus of tRNAArg. 
      The endonuclease cleavages are not ordered. Exonuclease activity(ies) remove the 
      spacer sequences from the 5' mature tRNAArg, and trim the 3' trailer portion from 
      tRNAAsp. Exonucleolytic removal of the 3' trailer does not require prior 
      endonuclease action, but removal of the spacer sequences from pre-tRNAArg is 
      incomplete without prior removal of the 5' leader sequences.

TI  - Yeast mRNA splicing in vitro.
PG  - 14780-92
AB  - Synthetic actin and CYH2 pre-mRNAs containing a single intron are accurately 
      spliced in a soluble whole cell extract of yeast. Splicing in vitro requires ATP. 
      The excised intron is released as a lariat in which an RNA branch connects the 5' 
      end of the molecule to the last A in the "intron conserved sequence" UACUAAC. Two 
      other discrete RNA species produced during splicing in vitro may represent 
      reaction intermediates: free, linear exon 1 and a form of the intron lariat 
      extending beyond the 3' splice site to include exon 2. Both lariat forms 
      correspond to molecules previously shown to be produced during yeast pre-mRNA 
      splicing in vivo.

TI  - Mutations in conserved intron sequences affect multiple steps in the yeast 
      splicing pathway, particularly assembly of the spliceosome.
PG  - 1683-95
AB  - Yeast introns contain three highly conserved sequences which are known to be 
      required for splicing of pre-mRNA. Using in vitro mutagenesis, we have 
      synthesized seven point mutations at five different sites in these signals in the 
      yeast actin intron. The mutant introns were then inserted into each of three 
      constructs, which allowed us to assess the consequences both in vivo and in 
      vitro. In virtually every case, we found the efficiency of splicing to be 
      significantly depressed; mature mRNA levels in vivo ranged from 0 to 47% of 
      wild-type. Surprisingly, the tightest mutations were not necessarily at the sites 
      of nucleolytic cleavage and branch formation; these nucleotides are thus highly 
      preferred, but are not absolutely necessary. Moreover, while particular 
      nucleotides are specifically required for the final step in splicing, i.e. 3' 
      cleavage and exon ligation, the predominant consequence of mutation within the 
      conserved signals appears to be the inhibition of assembly of the splicing 
      complex.

TI  - RNA11 protein is associated with the yeast spliceosome and is localized in the 
      periphery of the cell nucleus.
PG  - 2379-93
AB  - The yeast rna mutations (rna2 through rna10/11) are a set of 
      temperature-sensitive mutations that result in the accumulation of pre-mRNAs at 
      the nonpermissive temperature. Most of the yeast RNA gene products are involved 
      in and essential for mRNA splicing in vitro, suggesting that they code for 
      components of the splicing machinery. We tested this proposal by using an in 
      vitro-synthesized RNA11 protein to complement the temperature-sensitive defect of 
      the rna11 extract. During the in vitro complementation, the input RNA11 protein 
      was associated with the 40S spliceosome and a 30S complex, suggesting that the 
      RNA11 protein is indeed a component of the spliceosome. The formation of the 
      RNA11-associated 30S complex did not require any exogenous RNA substrate, 
      suggesting that this 30S particle is likely to be a preassembled complex involved 
      in splicing. The RNA11-specific antibody inhibited the mRNA splicing in vitro, 
      confirming the essential role of the RNA11 protein in mRNA splicing. Finally, 
      using the anti-RNA11 antibody, we localized the RNA11 protein to the periphery of 
      the yeast nucleus.

AB  - We have partially purified the yeast spliceosome by differential sedimentation in 
      glycerol gradients. By electron microscopy we have identified a particle in these 
      fractions that is the spliceosome. In 100 mM KCl buffer, the yeast spliceosome is 
      an ovoid disc with the dimensions of 20 x 23.5 nm with a central indentation. To 
      verify that these ovoid particles were spliceosomes, specific labels were used to 
      tag them. These tagged spliceosomes were then identified in the electron 
      microscope. The salt dependent shift of sedimentation rate for the spliceosome 
      can be explained by a change in size of the particle.

TI  - Mischarging mutants of Su+2 glutamine tRNA in E. coli. II. Amino acid 
      specificities of the mutant tRNAs.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Among the mischarging mutants isolated from strains with Su+2 glutamine tRNA, two 
      double-mutants, A37A29 and A37C38, have been suggested to insert tryptophan at 
      the UAG amber mutation site as determined by the suppression patterns of a set of 
      tester mutants of bacteria and phages (Yamao et al., 1988). In this paper, we 
      screened temperature sensitive mutants of E. coli in which the mischarging 
      suppression was abolished even at the permissive temperature. Four such mutants 
      were obtained and they were identified as the mutants of a structural gene for 
      tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (trpS). Authentic trpS mutations, such as trpS5 or 
      trpS18, also restricted the mischarging suppression. These results strongly 
      support the previous prediction that the mutant tRNAs of Su+2, A37A29 and A37C38, 
      are capable of interacting with tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and being 
      misaminoacylated with tryptophan in vivo. However, in an assay to determine the 
      specificity of the mutant glutamin tRNAs, we detected predominantly glutamine, 
      but not any other amino acid, being inserted at an amber codon in vivo to any 
      significant degree. We conclude that the mutant tRNAs still accept mostly 
      glutamine, but can accept tryptophan in an extent for mischarging suppression. 
      Since the amber suppressors of Su+7 tryptophan tRNA and the mischarging mutants 
      of Su+3 tyrosine tRNA are charged with glutamine, structural similarity among the 
      tRNAs for glutamine, tryptophan and tyrosine is discussed.

TI  - Substrate recognition and splice site determination in yeast tRNA splicing.
PG  - 719-30
AB  - S. cerevisae tRNA introns interrupt the gene at a constant position in the 
      anticodon loop. Pre-tRNAs are matured by an endonuclease and a ligase. The 
      endonuclease alone can accurately release the intron from the pre-tRNA. Here, we 
      investigate the mechanism of splice site selection by the endonuclease. We 
      propose that it initially recognizes features in the mature domain common to all 
      tRNAs. Once positioned on the enzyme, the splice sites are recognizable because 
      they are a fixed distance from the mature domain. To test this hypothesis, we 
      developed a system for synthesizing pre-tRNA by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. 
      To search for recognition sites, we made several mutations. Mutations of C56 and 
      U8 strongly affect endonuclease recognition of pre-tRNA. With insertion and 
      deletion mutations, we show that the anticodon stem determines splicing 
      specificity. The sequence and structure of the intron are not strong determinants 
      of splice site selection.

TI  - Structure and function of the yeast tRNA ligase gene.
PG  - 3171-6
AB  - We report here the DNA sequence of the entire coding region of the Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae tRNA ligase gene. tRNA ligase is one of two enzymes required for tRNA 
      splicing in yeast, and the enzyme is likely a single polypeptide with multiple 
      activities. We find that tRNA ligase is a basic protein of 827 amino acids 
      corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 95,400. The inferred amino 
      acid sequence for tRNA ligase is not significantly homologous to that of other 
      known proteins of similar activity. In addition to the tRNA ligase reading frame 
      and several other unidentified open reading frames, we have found two open 
      reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, near the 5'-end of the ligase structural gene. One 
      of these, ORF2, produces a divergent transcript which initiates only 125 
      nucleotides upstream of the tRNA ligase transcript, and is present in 
      approximately the same relative abundance as the transcript for tRNA ligase.

AB  - Synthetic ochre and amber tRNA suppressor genes derived from the yeast 
      tRNA(PheGAA) sequence have been constructed. They were efficiently transcribed in 
      vitro and expressed in vivo via a synthetic expression cassette. tRNA(PheUUA) and 
      tRNA(PheUUA) delta IVS (IVS = intervening sequence) are relatively inefficient 
      ochre suppressors. They are toxic to the cell when expressed on a multicopy 
      plasmid, and they do not suppress at all when present as single copies. The 
      intron does not seem to have any effect on suppression. In contrast, the amber 
      suppressor tRNA(PheCUA) delta IVS is efficient when expressed from a single-copy 
      plasmid, while its efficiency is reduced on a multicopy vector.

TI  - The subnuclear localization of tRNA ligase in yeast.
PG  - 1515-26
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase is an enzyme required for tRNA splicing. A study by indirect 
      immune fluorescence shows that this enzyme is localized in the cell nucleus. At 
      higher resolution, studies using indirect immune electron microscopy show this 
      nuclear location to be primarily at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, 
      most likely at the nuclear pore. There is a more diffuse, secondary location of 
      ligase in a region of the nucleoplasm within 300 nm of the nuclear envelope. When 
      the amount of ligase in the cell is increased, nuclear staining increases but 
      staining of the nuclear envelope remains constant. This experiment indicates that 
      there are a limited number of ligase sites at the nuclear envelope. Since the 
      other tRNA splicing component, the endonuclease, has the characteristics of an 
      integral membrane protein, we hypothesize that it constitutes the site for the 
      interaction of ligase with the nuclear envelope.

TI  - Splicing of yeast nuclear pre-mRNA in vitro requires a functional 40S spliceosome 
      and several extrinsic factors.
PG  - 7-18
AB  - We have previously shown that extracts prepared from most of the yeast 
      temperature-sensitive rna mutants are heat sensitive for pre-mRNA splicing in 
      vitro, and that the products of the corresponding RNA genes are essential for the 
      early stages of the splicing region. In this report, we demonstrate that most 
      heat-inactivated mutant extracts do not form the spliceosome, suggesting that 
      their gene products are likely to be involved in spliceosome formation. 
      Heat-inactivated rna2 extracts, on the other hand, do form a splicing-dependent 
      40S complex containing uncleaved pre-mRNA exclusively. The pre-mRNA in the 40S 
      complex can be converted to the splicing products in the presence of ATP and 
      complementing extracts. These results demonstrate that: (1) the 40S complex 
      formed in heat-inactivated rna2 extracts is a spliceosome (termed the rna2 delta 
      spliceosome), (2) the spliceosome is a functional intermediate in the splicing 
      pathway, and (3) the splicing process can be dissected into two steps, 
      spliceosome formation and cleavage-ligation reactions. Additional results 
      indicate that at least two extrinsic factors, as well as the RNA2 gene product, 
      are required for complementation of the rna2 delta spliceosome. A three-step 
      mechanism for nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in yeast is proposed.

AB  - The tRNA ligase protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the components 
      required for splicing of yeast tRNA precursors in vitro. We have purified this 
      protein to near homogeneity using an affinity elution chromatographic step. 
      Purified tRNA ligase is a 90-kDa protein that, in addition to catalyzing the 
      ligation of tRNA half-molecules in the coupled splicing reaction, will also 
      ligate an artificial substrate. Using this artificial substrate, we provide 
      evidence for the existence of a previously predicted activated intermediate in 
      the ligation reaction. The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal end of the 
      protein was determined, and we have used this information to isolate the 
      structural gene from a library of yeast DNA. We prove that this DNA encodes the 
      tRNA ligase protein by DNA sequencing and by demonstrating overproduction of the 
      protein.

AB  - We have fractionated a yeast whole cell extract that can accurately splice 
      synthetic actin and CYH2 pre-mRNAs. Three fractions, designated I, II, and III, 
      have been separated by use of ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography 
      on heparin agarose. Each fraction alone has no splicing activity. Fractions I and 
      II allow the first step of the splicing reaction to proceed, giving rise to the 
      splicing intermediates, free exon 1, and intron-exon 2. Addition of fraction III 
      completes the reaction. Micrococcal nuclease treatment of the whole cell extract 
      or of either fraction I or II abolished splicing activity, indicating that 
      fractions I and II have RNA moieties that are required in the splicing reaction. 
      The nature of the RNAs was examined using antibodies directed against the 
      trimethylated cap structure unique to small nuclear RNAs. Preincubation of the 
      whole cell extract with protein A-Sepharose coupled to trimethylated cap antibody 
      abolished splicing activity. This indicates that at least one essential RNA 
      component contains a trimethyl cap. Thus, in yeast as in mammalian systems, small 
      nuclear RNAs are involved in mRNA splicing.

TI  - Construction of two Escherichia coli amber suppressor genes: tRNAPheCUA and 
      tRNACysCUA.
PG  - 6548-52
AB  - Amber suppressor genes corresponding to Escherichia coli tRNAPhe and tRNACys have 
      been constructed for use in amino acid substitution studies as well as protein 
      engineering. The genes for either tRNAPheGAA or tRNACysGCA both with the 
      anticodon 5' CTA 3' were assembled from four to six oligonucleotides, which were 
      annealed and ligated into a vector. The suppressor genes are expressed 
      constitutively from a synthetic promoter, derived from the promoter sequence of 
      the E. coli lipoprotein gene. The tRNAPhe suppressor (tRNAPheCUA) is 54-100% 
      efficient in vivo, while the tRNACys suppressor (tRNACysCUA) is 17-50% efficient. 
      To verify that the suppressors insert the predicted amino acids, both genes were 
      used to suppress an amber mutation in a protein coding sequence. NH2-terminal 
      sequence analysis of the resultant proteins revealed that tRNAPheCUA and 
      tRNACysCUA insert phenylalanine and cysteine, respectively. To demonstrate the 
      potential of these suppressors, tRNAPheCUA and tRNACysCUA have been used to 
      effect amino acid substitutions at specific sites in the E. coli lac repressor.

TI  - The yeast RNA gene products are essential for mRNA splicing in vitro.
PG  - 953-63
AB  - The yeast rna mutations (rna2-rna11) are a set of temperature-sensitive mutations 
      that result in the accumulation of intron-containing mRNA precursors at the 
      restrictive temperature. We have used the yeast in vitro splicing system to 
      investigate the role of products of the RNA genes in mRNA splicing. We have 
      tested the heat lability of the in vitro mRNA splicing reaction in extracts 
      isolated from mutant and wild-type cells. Extracts isolated from seven of the 
      nine rna mutants demonstrated heat lability in this assay, while most wild-type 
      extracts were stable under the conditions utilized. We have also demonstrated 
      that heat inactivation usually results in the specific loss of an exchangeable 
      component by showing that most combinations of heat-inactivated extracts from 
      different mutants complement one another. In three cases (rna2, rna5, and rna11), 
      the linkage of the in vitro defect to the rna mutations was ascertained by a 
      combination of reversion, tetrad, and in vitro complementation analyses. 
      Furthermore, each heat-inactivated extract was capable of complementation by at 
      least one fraction of the wild-type splicing system. Thus many of the RNA genes 
      are likely to code for products directly involved in and essential for mRNA 
      splicing.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the coordinate expression of the yeast tRNAArg-tRNAAsp 
      gene tandem.
PG  - 2436-42
AB  - tRNA genes occur in the yeast genome as highly dispersed and independent 
      transcriptional units. The 5'-tRNAArg-tRNAAsp-3' gene tandem, separated by a 
      10-base-pair spacer sequence, thus represents a rare case of tight clustering. 
      Previous in vitro studies did not reveal any primary transcript from the tRNAAsp 
      gene, but rather a dimeric precursor containing both gene sequences plus spacer, 
      which undergoes a series of maturation steps. This seems anomalous since the 
      tRNAAsp gene contains the sequences necessary for its own transcription. We found 
      that site-directed mutation of the highly conserved C at position 56 to a G in 
      the tRNAArg gene suppresses all transcription and does not activate the tRNAAsp 
      gene. Precise deletion of the entire tRNAArg gene gives a similar result. Rescue 
      of tRNAAsp gene transcription is effected either by the precise deletion of both 
      the tRNAArg gene and spacer or by the precise deletion of this gene with 
      concomitant introduction of an artificial RNA polymerase III start site in the 
      spacer. This artificial start site is ineffective if the tRNAArg gene is present 
      upstream.

TI  - Effect of intron mutations on processing and function of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      SUP53 tRNA in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 2663-73
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae leucine-inserting amber suppressor tRNA gene SUP53 
      (a tRNALeu3 allele) was used to investigate the relationship between precursor 
      tRNA structure and mature tRNA function. This gene encodes a pre-tRNA which 
      contains a 32-base intron. The mature tRNASUP53 contains a 5-methylcytosine 
      modification of the anticodon wobble base. Mutations were made in the SUP53 
      intron. These mutant genes were transcribed in an S. cerevisiae nuclear extract 
      preparation. In this extract, primary tRNA gene transcripts are end-processed and 
      base modified after addition of cofactors. The base modifications made in vitro 
      were examined, and the mutant pre-tRNAs were analyzed for their ability to serve 
      as substrates for partially purified S. cerevisiae tRNA endonuclease and ligase. 
      Finally, the suppressor function of these mutant tRNA genes was assayed after 
      their integration into the S. cerevisiae genome. Mutant analysis showed that the 
      totally intact precursor tRNA, rather than any specific sequence or structure of 
      the intron, was necessary for efficient nonsense suppression by tRNASUP53. Less 
      efficient suppressor activity correlated with the absence of the 5-methylcytosine 
      modification. Most of the intron-altered precursor tRNAs were successfully 
      spliced in vitro, indicating that modifications are not critical for recognition 
      by the tRNA endonuclease and ligase.

TI  - Intron mutations affect splicing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUP53 precursor 
      tRNA.
PG  - 2674-83
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae amber suppressor tRNA gene SUP53 (a tRNALeu3 allele) 
      was used to investigate the role of intron structure and sequence on precursor 
      tRNA splicing in vivo and in vitro. This gene encodes a pre-tRNA which contains a 
      32-base intervening sequence. Two types of SUP53 intron mutants were constructed: 
      ones with an internal deletion of the natural SUP53 intron and ones with a novel 
      intron. These mutant genes were transcribed in vitro, and the end-processed 
      transcripts were analyzed for their ability to serve as substrates for the 
      partially purified S. cerevisiae tRNA endonuclease and ligase. The in vitro 
      phenotype of these mutant RNAs was correlated with the in vivo suppressor tRNA 
      function of these SUP53 alleles after integration of the genes into the yeast 
      genome. Analysis of these mutant pre-tRNAs, which exhibited no perturbation of 
      the mature domain, clearly showed that intron structure and sequence can have 
      profound effects on pre-tRNA splicing. All of the mutant RNAs, which were 
      inefficiently spliced or unspliced, evidenced cleavage only at the 5' splice 
      junction. Base changes in the intron proximal to the 3' splice junction could 
      partially rescue the splicing defect. The implications of these data for tRNA 
      endonuclease-substrate interactions are discussed.

TI  - A test for intron function in the yeast actin gene.
PG  - 183-4
AB  - Many eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences (IVS), but the rationale for 
      their existence remains a mystery. Previous studies done in our laboratory 
      demonstrated that the intron in a yeast tRNATyr gene, SUP6, does have a function. 
      We used the same approach to determine the role of introns in nuclear genes 
      encoding messenger RNAs. A single actin gene with one intron exists in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The level of actin in yeast appears to be crucial to 
      viability: either too much or too little actin inhibits growth. Therefore, small 
      effects on synthesis of actin protein resulting from the removal of the actin 
      gene intron would be expected to cause measurable changes in cell growth. In the 
      present study, an intron-deleted actin gene was constructed in vitro and was used 
      to replace the single resident actin gene in a haploid strain. Analysis of the 
      cells carrying the intron-deleted actin gene shows that the intervening sequence 
      is not essential for actin gene expression.

TI  - The "spliceosome": yeast pre-messenger RNA associates with a 40S complex in a 
      splicing-dependent reaction.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - The in vitro splicing reactions of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in a yeast 
      extract were analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Labeled pre-mRNA 
      appears in a 40S peak only if the pre-mRNA undergoes the first of the two partial 
      splicing reactions. RNA analysis after extraction of glycerol gradient fractions 
      shows that lariat-form intermediates, molecules that occur only in mRNA splicing, 
      are found almost exclusively in this 40S complex. Another reaction intermediate, 
      cut 5' exon RNA, can also be found concentrated in this complex. The complex is 
      stable even in 400 mM KCl, although at this salt concentration, it sediments at 
      35S and is clearly distinguishable from 40S ribosomal subunits. This complex, 
      termed a "spliceosome," is thought to contain components necessary for mRNA 
      splicing; its existence can explain how separated exons on pre-mRNA are brought 
      into contact.

TI  - Molecular consequences of specific intron mutations on yeast mRNA splicing in 
      vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - We have altered the TACTAAC sequence in the yeast CYH2m gene intron to TACTACC. 
      This mutation changes the nucleotide at the normal position of the branch in 
      intron RNA lariats produced during pre-mRNA splicing, and it prevents splicing in 
      vivo. In a yeast pre-mRNA splicing system, CYH2m pre-mRNA carrying the TACTACC 
      mutation is not specifically cut or rearranged in any way. Substitution of an A 
      for the first G of the CYH2m intron, converting the highly conserved GTATGT 5' 
      splice site sequence to ATATGT, also blocks intron excision in vivo and in vitro: 
      pre-mRNA carrying this mutation was still cut normally at the mutant 5' splice 
      site in vitro, to give authentic exon 1 and an intron-exon 2 lariat RNA with an 
      A-A 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage at the branch point. This lariat RNA is a 
      dead-end product. The subsequent cleavage at the 3' splice site is therefore 
      sensitive to the sequence of the 5' end of the intron attached at the branch 
      point.

TI  - Sequence organization and control of transcription in the bacteriophage T4 tRNA 
      region.
PG  - 545-63
AB  - Bacteriophage T4 contains genes for eight transfer RNAs and two stable RNAs of 
      unknown function. These are found in two clusters at 70 X 10(3) base-pairs on the 
      T4 genetic map. To understand the control of transcription in this region we have 
      completed the sequencing of 5000 base-pairs in this region. The sequence contains 
      a part of gene 3, gene 1, gene 57, internal protein I, the tRNA genes and five 
      open reading frames which most likely code for heretofore unidentified proteins. 
      We have used subclones of the region to investigate the kinetics of transcription 
      in vivo. The results show that transcription in this region consists of 
      overlapping early, middle and late transcripts. Transcription is directed from 
      two early promoters, one or two middle promoters and perhaps two late promoters. 
      This region contains all of the features that are seen in T4 transcription and as 
      such is a good place to study the phenomenon in more detail.

AB  - An inversion loop seen in heteroduplex mapping of the DNA of mature Mu phage 
      induced from a lysogen is observed also in defective lambda phage carrying one 
      end of Mu. 14% of the DNA of Mu, including this region, designated the G loop, is 
      shown to be to the right of all known genes in the prophage map. The 
      inhomogeneous ends of Mu are observed as a separate phenomenon and appear in all 
      mutants investigated. The recA and recBC functions of the host are not needed for 
      the inversion responsible for the G loop to take place. Deletions of Mu DNA in 
      the G-loop region have been isolated and are under study.

TI  - Transfer RNA synthesis in vitro.
PG  - 179-82
AB  - During infection of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage T4 directs the synthesis of 
      at least eight transfer RNAs and of two stable RNA species of low molecular 
      weight, of unknown function. When T4 DNA is incubated with purified RNA 
      polymerase and the appropriate substrates, a high molecular weight RNA is 
      produced. This RNA, on further incubation with a supernatant fraction prepared 
      from E. coli, is cleaved to several species of RNA. These cleaved RNAs were 
      analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fingerprint techniques, and were found to be 
      similar or identical to those made in vivo. The fingerprint analysis of one of 
      these, a tRNA(Gly), is presented. The molecule made in vitro, except for the 
      absence of modified bases, appears to be identical to the RNA made by T4-infected 
      cells. Therefore, in this system the tRNA genes are transcribed with fidelity, 
      the transcript is cleaved correctly, and the tRNAs are made in good yield.

TI  - Lariat structures are in vivo intermediates in yeast pre-mRNA splicing.
PG  - 611-21
AB  - Transcripts from an ADC1-actin gene fusion containing the yeast actin intron are 
      efficiently spliced in vivo. Four distinct forms of the excised actin intron are 
      found in poly(A)- RNA from yeast carrying this transcription unit on a multicopy 
      plasmid. Two of them migrate abnormally slowly in polyacrylamide gels, and one of 
      these contains a block to reverse transcription at the conserved UACUAAC sequence 
      (TACTAAC box). We also detect a larger RNA in the poly(A)+ fraction with abnormal 
      gel mobility and the same reverse transcriptase block. Analysis of the major 
      species of excised actin intron, labeled with 32P in vivo, reveals the presence 
      of a branch at the third A in the UACUAAC sequence. This A is linked via a 3'-5' 
      phosphodiester bond to the downstream C, and via a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to a 
      G, presumably from the 5' end of the intron. Thus this intron RNA is in the form 
      of a lariat.

TI  - Precise excision of intervening sequences from precursor tRNAs by a 
      membrane-associated yeast endonuclease.
PG  - 525-36
AB  - Splicing of transfer RNA precursors containing intervening sequences proceeds in 
      two distinct stages: endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by ligation. We have 
      physically separated endonuclease and ligase activities from extracts of yeast 
      cells, and we report properties of the partially purified endonuclease 
      preparation. The endonuclease behaves as an integral membrane protein: it is 
      purified from a membrane fraction from which it can be solubilized with nonionic 
      detergents, and the activity of the endonuclease in the membrane fraction is 
      stimulated by nonionic detergents. The endonuclease cleaves precursor tRNAs at 
      two sites to excise the intervening sequence precisely. Both the extent and the 
      accuracy of cleavage are enhanced by the presence of spermidine; the degree of 
      stimulation varies with the pre-tRNA substrate. The cleavage products possess 
      5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester termini. The cyclic phosphodiester 
      termini can be opened to 2'-phosphates by a cyclic phosphodiesterase activity in 
      the preparation.

TI  - tRNA gene transcription in yeast: effects of specified base substitutions in the 
      intragenic promoter.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - The yeast SUP53 gene encodes a leucine-inserting amber suppressor tRNA. We have 
      introduced specific base substitutions into both 5' and 3' elements of the 
      intragenic promoter of this tRNA gene. The influence of these sequence changes on 
      promoter function has been investigated by transcription of the mutant genes in a 
      homologous cell-free system. Our results do not support the idea that tertiary 
      intragenic structure is important in tRNA gene transcription. For one of the 
      SUP53 mutants we are able to suggest a plausible molecular basis for defective 
      transcription: a single base substitution in the 3' element of the intragenic 
      promoter prevents the interaction of this element with a putative transcription 
      factor.

TI  - Dimeric tRNA precursors in yeast.
PG  - 750-2
AB  - Two DNA fragments, each containing tRNA(Arg)3 and a tRNA(Asp) gene in close 
      conjunction, have been isolated from different genomic regions of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. Nucleotide Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene regions revealed 
      that in both fragments the tRNA(Arg)3 coding region is located 5'-proximal to the 
      tRNA(Asp) coding region. They are separated by an identical spacer of 10 
      nucleotides. Although the 5'-flanking sequences are different in the two 
      plasmids, some similarities are observed. To test the mode of expression of this 
      gene configuration, we transcribed the DNA fragments in a Xenopus oocyte nuclear 
      extract. Specific transcription of the yeast tRNA genes took place in an RNA 
      precursor which comprised both tRNA species. We report here that the precursor 
      RNA was processed to the mature-sized tRNA molecules, indicating the presence of 
      an enzyme activity in the Xenopus nucleus capable of cutting a dimeric tRNA 
      precursor. This is the first observation of a eukaryotic dimeric tRNA precursor.

AB  - Precise deletion of the intervening sequence of a yeast tRNATyr ochre suppressor 
      gene (SUP6) significantly reduced its suppressor activity relative to that of the

      modification, normally present at the middle anticodon position of mature 
      suppressor tRNA, in tRNA synthesized in vivo from the deleted gene.

TI  - RNA ligase in bacteria: formation of a 2',5' linkage by an E. coli extract.
PG  - 899-906
AB  - Ligase activity was detected in extracts of Escherichia coli, Clostridium 
      tartarivorum, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Chromatium gracile, and Chlorobium 
      limicola. Ligase was measured by joining of tRNA halves produced from yeast 
      IVS-containing tRNA precursors by a yeast endonuclease. The structure of tRNATyr 
      halves joined by an E. coli extract was examined. The ligated junction is 
      resistant to nuclease P1 and RNAase T2 but sensitive to venom phosphodiesterase 
      and alkaline hydrolysis, consistent with a 2',5' linkage. The nuclease-resistant 
      junction dinucleotide comigrates with authentic (2',5') APA marker in thin-layer 
      chromatography. The phosphate in the newly formed phosphodiester bond is derived 
      from the pre-tRNA substrate. The widespread existence of a bacterial ligase 
      raises the possibility of a novel class of RNA processing reactions.

TI  - Directed mutagenesis of dihydrofolate reductase.
PG  - 782-8
AB  - Three mutations of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase were constructed by 
      oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of the cloned Escherichia coli gene. The 
      mutations--at residue 27, aspartic acid replaced with asparagine; at residue 39, 
      proline replaced with cysteine; and at residue 95, glycine replaced with 
      alanine--were designed to answer questions about the relations between molecular 
      structure and function that were raised by the x-ray crystal structures. 
      Properties of the mutant proteins show that Asp-27 is important for catalysis and 
      that perturbation of the local structure at a conserved cis peptide bond 
      following Gly-95 abolishes activity. Substitution of cysteine for proline at 
      residue 39 results in the appearance of new forms of the enzyme that correspond 
      to various oxidation states of the cysteine. One of these forms probably 
      represents a species cross-linked by an intrachain disulfide bridge between the 
      cysteine at position 85 and the new cysteine at position 39.

AB  - Transcription of a tRNAArg-tRNAAsp gene pair from Saccharomyces cerevisiae by an 
      homologous yeast extract results in a dimeric percursor molecule which is 
      processed to mature-sized tRNAArg and tRNAAsp molecules. We have transcribed 
      linear DNA fragments cleaved within the gene sequences to show that precursor 
      synthesis is not dependent on the internal promoter of the second gene (tRNAAsp). 
      Furthermore, the second gene does not support independent transcription when the 
      normal upstream initiation site is removed.

TI  - Cloning of the Vibrio harveyi luciferase genes: use of a synthetic 
      oligonucleotide probe.
PG  - 120-3
AB  - A mixed-sequence synthetic oligonucleotide probe was used to isolate a clone 
      containing the gene encoding the alpha subunit of bacterial luciferase from 
      Vibrio harveyi and part of the gene coding for the beta subunit. DNA sequence 
      analysis has allowed us to determine that the genes are closely linked on the 
      bacterial chromosome and transcribed in the same direction. Comparison of the 
      sequences in the regions preceding the two structural genes has revealed 
      considerable homology and has identified sites that may be involved in the 
      expression of the genes. Identification of a clone from a clone bank of total 
      genomic DNA from this organism shows that mixed probes can be successfully used 
      to isolate a gene of interest from any bacterium provided some protein sequence 
      for the gene product is available.

      toward depression of the ST segment of the electrocardiogram. Despite the 
      relationship between aggression and ST response, and the greater aggressiveness 
      of Type A's during the interactions, Type A's and Type B's did not differ 
      significantly in ST response.

TI  - Effects of apomorphine on elicited and operant pecking in pigeons.
PG  - 237-41
AB  - The effects of apomorphine (0.001--32.0 mg/kg) on elicited and operant pecking 
      were studied in pigeons. Elicited pecking was measured in a 1-h observation test. 
      Apomorphine caused dose-related increases in the pecking elicited by the drug in 
      all the subjects, with maximal responding at 3.2 mg/kg. In contrast, operant 
      responding on a multiple, 5 min fixed interval, 30 response fixed-ratio schedule 
      revealed individual differences in sensitivity to the drug. A dose of 0.32 mg/kg 
      eliminated key pecking in fixed-interval and fixed-ratio components in 4 (group 
      1) of the 15 subjects while 3.2 mg/kg eliminated responding in 9 other subjects 
      (group 2), and 2 of the subjects (group 3) required 32.0 mg/kg to eliminate 
      responding. The 13 birds in groups 1 and 2 showed decreases in operant responding 
      with concomitant increases in elicited pecking. For the 2 remaining birds, 
      increases in operant behavior were highly correlated with increased stereotypy. 
      The effects of apomorphine on operant behavior appeared to depend on induced 
      stereotypy, with rate-decreasing effects resulting from the disruption of ongoing 
      behavior by stereotyped pecking aimed elsewhere in the chamber, and rate 
      increases resulting from the redirection of elicited pecking towards the operant 
      key.

TI  - An RNA ligase from wheat germ which participates in transfer RNA splicing in 
      vitro.
PG  - 8365-73
AB  - Transfer RNA half-molecules are intermediates in the splicing of tRNA precursors 
      containing intervening sequences. We have utilized yeast tRNA half-molecules to 
      identify and partially purify an ATP-dependent RNA ligase activity from extracts 
      of wheat germ. This activity can complement a yeast tRNA endonuclease in vitro to 
      efficiently splice 10 different yeast tRNA precursors. The products of in vitro 
      splicing are a covalently joined tRNA and a circular intervening sequence RNA. 
      The internucleotide bond formed at the splice junction is a 2'-phosphomonoester, 
      3',5'-phosphodiester structure. The 2'-phosphate originates from the 2',3'-cyclic 
      phosphate at the 3' terminus of the 5' half-tRNA. The phosphodiester phosphate is 
      derived from the gamma-phosphate of ATP.

TI  - Enzymatic mechanism of an RNA ligase from wheat germ.
PG  - 8374-83
AB  - We have characterized the mechanism of action of a wheat germ RNA ligase which 
      has been partially purified on the basis of its ability to participate in in 
      vitro splicing of yeast tRNA precursors (Gegenheimer, P., Gabius, H-J., Peebles, 
      C.L., and Abelson, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8365-8373). The preparation 
      catalyzes the ligation of oligoribonucleotide substrates forming a 
      2'-phosphomonoester, 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage. The 5' terminus of an RNA 
      substrate can have either a 5'-hydroxyl or a 5'-phosphate. The 5'-phosphate, 
      which for a 5'-hydroxyl substrate can be introduced by a polynucleotide kinase 
      activity in the preparation, is incorporated into the ligated junction. The 3' 
      terminus can have either a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or a 2'-phosphate. 2',3'-Cyclic 
      phosphates can be converted into 2'-phosphates by a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, 
      3'-phosphodiesterase activity in the preparation. The 2'-phosphate of the ligated 
      product is derived from the phosphate at the 3' terminus of the substrate. 
      Ligation proceeds with the adenylylation of the 5'-phosphorylated terminus to 
      form an intermediate with a 5',5'-phosphoanhydride bond.

      of this region of the gene in transcription and processing of the pre-tRNA(3) 
      (Leu), the yeast DNA was cloned in plasmid pBR322 and a 21-base-pair DNA fragment 
      corresponding to the lac operator was inserted into the intervening sequence. 
      Insertion was done at a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease Hpa I that 
      occurs 19/20 base pairs from the 5' end of the intervening sequence. The parent 
      and modified plasmids were then transcribed in a Xenopus germinal vesicle 
      extract. RNA-fingerprint analysis of the transcription products revealed that 
      both the tRNA(3) (Leu) gene and its modified counterpart were accurately 
      transcribed. Transcription products corresponding to mature tRNA(3) (Leu) and 
      pre-RNA(3) (Leu) with the normal and lac-containing intervening sequence were 
      identified. Precursors extended at their 5' and 3' ends were also present. Both 
      parent and modified genes were transcribed efficiently, and the various products 
      accumulated in similar amounts, indicating that no deleterious effects on 
      transcriptional competence, stability of the transcripts, or processing result 
      from insertion of the 21-base-pair lac operator DNA. Incubation of pre-tRNA 
      molecules that contained intervening sequences but were 5' and 3' mature with a 
      yeast ribosomal wash fraction resulted in excision of the intervening sequence 
      and, in the presence of ATP, ligation of the resulting half-tRNA molecules. The 
      presence of RNA complementary to lac operator DNA neither inhibited the excision 
      and splicing activities nor altered the site of the junction.

TI  - Directed deletion of a yeast transfer RNA intervening sequence.
PG  - 1396-400
AB  - Many eukaryotic genes contain intevening sequences, segments of DNA that 
      interrupt the continuity of the gene. They are removed from RNA transcripts of 
      the gene by a process known as splicing. The intervening sequence in a yeast 
      tyrosine transfer RNA (tRNA Tyr) suppressor gene was deleted in order to test its 
      role in the expression of the gene. The altered gene and its parent were 
      introduced into yeast by transformation. Both genes exhibited suppressor 
      function, showing that the intervening sequence is not absolutely essential for 
      the expression of this gene.

TI  - Isolation and sequence of the gene for actin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 3912-6
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to contain the highly conserved and 
      unbiquitous protein actin. We have used cloned actin sequences from Dictyostelium 
      discoideum to identify and clone the actin gene in yeast. Hybridization to 
      genomic fragments of yeast DNA suggest that there is a single actin gene in 
      yeast. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of that gene and its flanking 
      regions. The sequence of the gene reveals an intervening sequence of 309 base 
      pairs in the coding sequences at the 5' end of the gene. The existence and 
      location of the intervening sequence was verified by using the dideoxy chain 
      termination technique to determine the sequence at the 5' terminus of the actin 
      mRNA. The similarity of the splice junction sequences in this gene to those found 
      in higher eukaryotes suggests that yeast must possess a similar splicing enzyme.

TI  - The transfer RNA identity problem: a search for rules.
PG  - 191-7
AB  - Correct recognition of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases is 
      central to the maintenance of translational fidelity. The hypothesis that 
      synthetases recognize anticodon nucleotides was proposed in 1964 and had 
      considerable experimental support by the mid-1970s. Nevertheless, the idea was 
      not widely accepted until relatively recently in part because the methodologies 
      initially available for examining tRNA recognition proved hampering for 
      adequately testing alternative hypotheses. Implementation of new technologies has 
      led to a reasonably complete picture of how tRNAs are recognized. The anticodon 
      is indeed important for 17 of the 20 Escherichia coli isoaccepting groups. For 
      many of the isoaccepting groups, the acceptor stem or position 73 (or both) is 
      important as well.

TI  - Pentagastrin infusions in patients with panic disorder. II. Neuroendocrinology.
PG  - 84-96
AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) has well-documented anxiogenic effects in animals and 
      normal people, and panicogenic effects in patients with panic disorder, but 
      little is known about its neuroendocrine profile. We examined neuroendocrine 
      responses to intravenous infusions of pentagastrin, a selective CCK-B receptor 
      agonist, in 10 patients with panic disorder and 10 normal control subjects. 
      Pentagastrin potently activated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, 
      but did not release growth hormone or any of several vasoactive peptides 
      (neurokinin A, substance P, vasoactive intestinal peptide). The HPA axis response 
      was unrelated to increases in symptoms. Panic patients did not differ from 
      controls in neuroendocrine responses to the CCK agonist. Differential sensitivity 
      to novelty stress accounted for the only patient-control differences in 
      neuroendocrine profiles. The data suggest that CCK may help modulate normal HPA 
      axis activity, but its anxiogenic effects are unrelated to its stimulatory 
      effects on the HPA axis. Pentagastrin provides a safe and readily available probe 
      for further study of CCK receptor systems in humans.

TI  - Specificity of Prp24 binding to RNA: a role for Prp24 in the dynamic interaction 
      of U4 and U6 snRNAs.
PG  - 132-45
AB  - Prp24 was previously isolated as a suppressor of a cold-sensitive U4 mutation and 
      is required for at least the first step of splicing in vitro. Our investigation 
      of the in vitro RNA binding properties of the purified Prp24 protein shows that 
      it binds preferentially to the U4/U6 hybrid snRNAs compared to other snRNAs. The 
      interaction between Prp24 and the U4/U6 hybrid appears to involve two regions in 
      the RNA: the 39-57 region of U6 and stem II of the U4/U6 hybrid. Interestingly, 
      some U4 mutations, which destabilize stem II, increase the affinity of Prp24 for 
      the U4/U6 RNAs compared to the wild type. This suggests that the binding of Prp24 
      to the U4/U6 RNAs may involve some destabilization of the RNA duplex. We also 
      found that Prp24 can stimulate the annealing of U4 and U6, suggesting that Prp24 
      participates in both the formation and disassembly of the U4/U6 hybrid during 
      splicing.

TI  - Does the community want devolved authority? Results of deliberative polling in 
      Ontario.
PG  - 403-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain and contrast the informed opinions of people in five 
      decision-making groups that could have a role in devolved governance of health 
      care and social services. DESIGN: Deliberative polling. SETTING: Three rural and 
      three urban communities selected from the 32 areas covered by a district health 
      council in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 citizens from five potential 
      decision-making groups: randomly selected citizens, attendees at town-hall 
      meetings, appointees to district health councils, elected officials and experts 
      in health care and social services. INTERVENTION: Participants' opinions were 
      polled during 29 structured 2-hour meetings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' 
      opinions on their personal willingness and their group's suitability to be 
      involved in devolved decision making, desired type of decision-making 
      involvement, information preferences, preferred areas of decision-making 
      involvement and preferred composition of decision-making bodies. RESULTS: Mean 
      attendance at each meeting was 9.6 citizens. Although there were some significant 
      differences in opinion among the five potential decision-making groups, there 
      were few differences among citizens from different geographic areas. A total of 
      189 (72%) of people polled were personally willing to take on a role involving 
      responsibility for overall decision-making, but far fewer thought that their 
      group was suited to taking on responsibility (30%) or a consulting role (55%). 
      Elected officials were the most willing (85% personally willing, 50% thought 
      their group was suitable) and randomly selected citizens the least willing (60% 
      personally willing, 17% thought their group was suitable) to take responsibility 
      for overall decision making. Most citizens polled indicated less interest in 
      involvement in specific types of decisions, except for planning and setting 
      priorities, than in overall decision making. Only 24 participants (9%) rated 
      their own group as suitable to take responsibility for raising revenue, 91 (33%) 
      deemed their group suited to distribution of funds and 108 (39%) felt their group 
      was suitable for management of services. People in all five groups ranked health 
      care needs (mean rank 1.5 out of four options) as the most important and 
      preferences (mean rank 3.6) as the least important information. They rated a 
      combination body involving several community groups as the most suitable overall 
      decision-making body (8.8 on 10-point scale). Participants favoured the 
      representation of elected officials, the provincial government and experts on 
      combination bodies responsible for the specific types of decisions. Overall, as 
      the complexity of devolved decision making became clear, participants tended to 
      assign authority to traditional decision makers such as elected officials, 
      experts and the provincial government, but also favoured a consulting role for 
      attendees at town-hall meetings (i.e., interested citizens). CONCLUSION: There 
      are significant differences among groups in the community in their willingness to 
      be involved, desired roles and representation in devolved decision making on 
      health care and social services in Ontario.

TI  - Reliability and clinical validity of UM-CIDI DSM-III-R generalized anxiety 
      disorder.
PG  - 95-110
AB  - This is the first in a series of reports on the long-term test-retest reliability 
      and procedural validity of the UM-CIDI, a modified version of the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview used in the US National Comorbidity Survey 
      (NCS). This report focuses on DSM-III-R Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The 
      NCS administered the UM-CIDI to a nationally representative sample of 8098 
      respondents in the age range 15-54. A subsample of 36 respondents was 
      subsequently selected for clinical reappraisal of GAD, consisting of 
      reinterviewing by a clinical reappraisal interviewer who blindly readministered 
      the GAD section of the UM-CIDI followed by an expanded version of the GAD section 
      of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). The test-retest 
      reliability of UM-CIDI/DSM-III-R lifetime GAD is Kappa = .53. When the 
      requirement that the worries be excessive or unrealistic (A2) is removed, as in 
      ICD-10 and partially in DSM-IV, reliability increases to Kappa = .78. The 
      concordance between the baseline UM-CIDI diagnosis and the SCID diagnosis is 
      Kappa = .35, while the cross-sectional concordance is Kappa = .47 (.66 when the 
      Criterion A2 requirement is removed). Item-level analysis shows that lack of 
      concordance between the UM-CIDI and the SCID is due largely to Criteria A2 and D. 
      The A2 problem could be addressed either by deemphasizing the 
      cognitive-evaluative component of GAD as in ICD-10, or by removing consideration 
      of the term "unrealistic" from the criterion as in DSM-IV and more clearly 
      specifying the meaning of the term "excessive". These options require further 
      research on similarities and differences in risk factors, course, family history, 
      and treatment response of more narrowly and broadly defined GAD. The Criterion D 
      problem is due to lack of clarity in what constitutes a symptom occurring 
      "often". This is clarified in DSM-IV. It is likely that this clarification will 
      make it possible to develop more precisely structured questions to evaluate 
      Criterion D in subsequent revisions of the UM-CIDI, resulting in improved 
      reliability and validity.

TI  - Nicotinic receptor binding site probed with unnatural amino acid incorporation in 
      intact cells.
PG  - 439-42
AB  - The nonsense codon suppression method for unnatural amino acid incorporation has 
      been applied to intact cells and combined with electrophysiological analysis to 
      probe structure-function relations in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. 
      Functional receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes when tyrosine and 
      phenylalanine derivatives were incorporated at positions 93, 190, and 198 in the 
      binding site of the alpha subunit. Subtle changes in the structure of an 
      individual side chain produced readily detectable changes in the function of this 
      large channel protein. At each position, distinct features of side chain 
      structure dominated the dose-response relation, probably by governing the 
      agonist-receptor binding.

TI  - Novel substrate specificity engineered in the arabinose binding protein.
PG  - 997-1004
AB  - The L-arabinose binding protein (ABP) of Escherichia coli naturally binds 
      L-arabinose and D-galactose with very high affinity and, with reduced affinity, a 
      variety of other sugars that differ only at the C5 position of the pyranose ring. 
      However, there are stringent specificity requirements at the 1, 2, 3 and 4 
      positions. Based on the high resolution crystallographic structure of the 
      ligand-protein complex, remodelling of the binding pocket was attempted to shift 
      the specificity towards C1-substituted galactosides. To create space in the 
      vicinity of the reducing end of bound galactose, four residues, Lys10, Asp90, 
      Thr147 and Leu145, have been mutated for residues with smaller side chains. 
      Forty-seven mutants containing different combinations of these mutations were 
      tested by fluorometry for their ability to bind methyl-beta-D-galactoside 
      (met-beta-Gal) or iso-propyl-beta-D-thio-galactoside (IPTG). Two double-residue 
      mutants carrying Ser at position 147 and Ala or Gly at position 90 appeared of 
      particular interest for being able to bind met-beta-Gal or IPTG, respectively, 
      and no longer galactose. Fluorescence experiments and molecular modelling 
      indicate that the mode of binding of the new substrates to the mutant proteins 
      might be similar to that of the natural ligands to wild-type ABP.

TI  - Pentagastrin infusions in patients with panic disorder. I. Symptoms and 
      cardiovascular responses.
PG  - 73-83
AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) may mediate human anxiety and animal data suggest that 
      cholecystokinin antagonists could provide an important advance in the treatment 
      of anxiety disorders. The study of CCK receptor systems in psychiatric patients 
      has, however, been severely limited by the lack of available probes. We utilized 
      intravenous infusions of pentagastrin, a selective CCK-B receptor agonist, and 
      studied behavioral and cardiovascular responses in 10 patients with panic 
      disorder and 10 normal controls. Pentagastrin produced substantial 
      symptomatology, including anxiety, and increases in heart rate and blood 
      pressure, in both patients and controls. Patients were more sensitive to the 
      panicogenic effects of the pentagastrin. Panic attacks occurred in 70% of 
      patients and 0% of controls. Patients' symptom responses were very similar to 
      their "typical" panic attacks and to symptoms produced by CCK4. Pentagastrin 
      provides a readily available alternative to CCK4 for studying the CCK receptor 
      system and exploring its involvement in human anxiety.

TI  - Is reasonable access what we want? Implications of, and challenges to, current 
      Canadian policy on equity in health care.
PG  - 629-53
AB  - Considerations of equity in the context of health care systems are often related 
      closely to the presence or level of prices incurred by users of health care 
      services. Some politicians and commentators have suggested that the removal of 
      user charges under the Canadian health care system has led to equal access to 
      care. But it is not clear that the equity principle inferred from these claims 
      corresponds to the equity goals of current Canadian health policy. In this 
      article the authors identify the precise equity principle that lies behind 
      current health policy in Canada and consider the extent to which that principle 
      is reflected in the performance of the system. They then consider other 
      approaches to equity in health care in the context of the stated objectives of 
      Canadian health policy and identify the implications of pursuing reasonable 
      access in future health policy. The authors suggest that the implications of the 
      current equity goals have not been recognized by policy makers, and if they were 
      to be recognized it is not clear that they would be acceptable to Canadian 
      populations and/or policy makers. Moreover, some of the implications would appear 
      to be incompatible with other stated objectives of public policy.

AB  - A study of the recognition of tRNA(Cys) by Escherichia coli cysteinyl-tRNA 
      synthetase using in vivo and in vitro methods was performed. All three anticodon 
      nucleotides, the discriminator nucleotide (73), and some elements within the 
      tertiary domain (the D stem/loop, the T psi C stem/loop, and the variable loop) 
      are important for recognition; the anticodon stem and acceptor stem appear to 
      contain no essential elements. A T7 RNA polymerase transcript corresponding to 
      tRNA(Cys) is only a 5.5-fold worse substrate than native tRNA(Cys) (in terms of 
      the specificity constant, kcat/Km), mainly due to an increase in the value of Km 
      for the transcript. The greatest loss of specificity caused by mutation of a 
      single nucleotide occurs when the discriminator U73 is changed; kcat/Km declines 
      3-4 orders of magnitude depending on the substitution. Mutations in the wobble 
      nucleotide of the anticodon also cause reductions in the specificity constant of 
      3 orders of magnitude, while mutations in the other anticodon nucleotides caused 
      lesser effects. Interestingly, a C35A mutation (with the phenylalanine anticodon 
      GAA) had no effect on aminoacylation by the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. Several 
      amber suppressor tRNAs were constructed whose in vivo identity did not correlate 
      with their in vitro specificity, indicating the need for both types of 
      experiments to understand the factors which maintain tRNA specificity.

TI  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRP21 gene product is an integral component of the 
      prespliceosome.
PG  - 6771-5
AB  - In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the prp21 mutation causes accumulation of unspliced 
      pre-mRNA at the nonpermissive temperature. We have cloned the PRP21 gene by 
      complementation of its temperature-sensitive phenotype and found it to be the 
      same as SPP91, an extragenic suppressor of the prp9 mutation previously studied 
      in vivo by Chapon and Legrain [Chapon, C. & Legrain, P. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 
      3279-3288]. We have analyzed the effects of the prp21 mutation on splicing in 
      vitro and have found that PRP21 is a splicing factor required for prespliceosome 
      assembly. We also have analyzed the interaction of PRP21 with splicing complexes 
      using anti-PRP21 antibodies and found that the RNA components of the 
      prespliceosome--U1 and U2 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) particles and pre-mRNA--are 
      specifically coimmunoprecipitated under splicing conditions in the presence of 
      0.2 M KCl. At higher KCl concentrations, U1 snRNP dissociates from splicing 
      complexes; nevertheless, U2 snRNA and pre-mRNA are still efficiently 
      immunoprecipitated. Immunoprecipitation of both U1 and U2 snRNA as well as 
      pre-mRNA is ATP-dependent and requires a pre-mRNA capable of supporting 
      prespliceosome assembly. Analysis of the unbound complexes in native gels 
      confirmed that prespliceosomes are specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-PRP21 
      antibodies. These results demonstrate that PRP21 is an integral component of the 
      prespliceosome and establishes a stable interaction with U2 snRNP and/or pre-mRNA 
      in that complex.

TI  - Four yeast spliceosomal proteins (PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21) interact to 
      promote U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNA.
PG  - 1909-25
AB  - We have analyzed the functions of several pre-mRNA processing (PRP) proteins in 
      yeast spliceosome formation. Here, we show that PRP5 (a DEAD box helicase-like 
      protein), PRP9, and PRP11 are each required for the U2 snRNP to bind to the 
      pre-spliceosome during spliceosome assembly in vitro. Genetic analyses of their 
      functions suggest that they and another protein, PRP21, act concertedly and/or 
      interact physically with each other and with the stem-loop IIa of U2 snRNA to 
      bind U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. Biochemical complementation experiments also 
      indicate that the PRP9 and PRP11 proteins interact. The PRP9 and PRP11 proteins 
      may be functioning similarly in yeast and mammalian cells. The requirement for 
      ATP and the helicase-like PRP5 protein suggests that these factors might promote 
      a conformational change (involving either the U1 or U2 snRNP) that is required 
      for the association of U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA.

TI  - Yeast tRNA-splicing endonuclease cleaves precursor tRNA in a random pathway.
PG  - 672-7
AB  - Introns interrupt many of the tRNA genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a 
      constant position in the anticodon loop. Pre-tRNA transcripts must be accurately 
      cleaved at 3' and 5' splice sites by tRNA endonuclease to release these introns. 
      In order to study splice site cleavage order, substrates were prepared in which 
      the ribose 2'-OH at each of the splice sites was phosphorylated. This 
      modification blocked cleavage by the endonuclease. We found that whichever splice 
      site was blocked the endonuclease can cleave the other site, indicating that the 
      two splice sites were cleaved independently. The endonuclease also cleaved both 
      3'- and 5'-nicked pre-tRNA(Phe). In addition, both kinds of "2/3 molecules" 
      (exon+intron) were observed in kinetic studies, indicating that they were true 
      biochemical intermediates. The rates of cleavage at the 3' and 5' splice sites of 
      pre-tRNA were compared in several ways. The results showed that the endonuclease 
      cleaves 3' and 5' sites at almost the same rate in the first cleavage, whereas in 
      the second cleavage the 3' site was cleaved faster, indicating that the rates of 
      the two routes for cleavage were unequal. These results demonstrated that the 
      endonuclease cleaved pre-tRNA in a random order, creating two routes for removal 
      of introns from pre-tRNA.

TI  - Novel activity of a yeast ligase deletion polypeptide. Evidence for GTP-dependent 
      tRNA splicing.
PG  - 2435-43
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase possesses multiple activities which are required for the 
      joining of tRNA halves during the tRNA splicing process: cyclic 
      phosphodiesterase, kinase, adenylylate synthetase, and ligase. A deletion 
      polypeptide of a dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion protein, designated DAC, 
      was previously shown to join tRNA halves although ATP-dependent kinase activity 
      was not measurable in the assay used. We describe here a characterization of the 
      mechanism of joining used by DAC and the structure of the tRNA product. DAC 
      produces a joined tRNA and a splice junction with a structure identical to that 
      produced by DAKC, the full-length dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion. 
      Furthermore, DAC can use GTP as the sole cofactor in the joining reaction, in 
      contrast to DAKC, which can only complete splicing in the presence of ATP. Both 
      enzymes exhibit GTP-dependent kinase activity at 100-fold greater efficiency than 
      with ATP. These results suggest that a potential function for the center domain 
      of tRNA ligase (missing in DAC) is to provide structural integrity and aid in 
      substrate interactions and specificity. They also support the hypothesis that 
      ligase may prefer to use two different cofactors during tRNA splicing.

TI  - Multiple nucleotide cofactor use by yeast ligase in tRNA splicing. Evidence for 
      independent ATP- and GTP-binding sites.
PG  - 2444-50
AB  - We have examined multiple cofactor usage by yeast tRNA ligase in splicing in 
      vitro. The ligase mechanism of action requires expenditure of two molar 
      equivalents of nucleotide cofactor per mole of tRNA product. Recent evidence 
      (Westaway, S.K., Belford, H.G., Apostol, B.L., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. 
      (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2435-2443) demonstrated that the ligase-associated 
      kinase activity is more efficient with GTP as cofactor than with ATP. Employing a 
      ligase fusion construct with dihydrofolate reductase (Apostol, B.L., Westaway, 
      S.K., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7445-7455) for 
      purposes of enzyme purification, we performed joining assays demonstrating that 
      ATP and GTP are the most effective combination of cofactors. ATP was essential to 
      the joining reaction, while UTP, CTP, or ATP replaced GTP inefficiently. Specific 
      and functionally independent binding sites were confirmed for ATP and GTP by 
      direct binding measurement. A third site was implicated in UTP- and CTP-ligase 
      interactions. Comparison of binding constants with Kapp values determined for 
      nucleotide-dependent joining suggested both that nucleotide triphosphate binding 
      may be limiting in tRNA joining and that tRNA ligation occurs most efficiently 
      using GTP for the kinase reaction and ATP as the adenylylate synthetase cofactor.

TI  - Stages in the second reaction of pre-mRNA splicing: the final step is ATP 
      independent.
PG  - 320-9
AB  - We have analyzed pre-mRNA splicing in yeast extracts immunodepleted of the PRP18 
      protein. We find that while the first step of splicing (cleavage at the 5' splice 
      site, and generation of the exon 1 and lariat intermediates) is unaffected by the 
      absence of PRP18, the second step of splicing (excision of the lariat intron and 
      formation of mRNA) is substantially slower in the absence of PRP18. The splicing 
      intermediates that are formed in the absence of PRP18 can be rapidly chased into 
      products by the addition of purified PRP18 protein. This chasing is not dependent 
      on ATP, implying that ATP is not required during the second cleavage-and-ligation 
      reaction. This result suggests that there are ordered stages within the second 
      step of splicing and that PRP18 acts late in the second step, perhaps during the 
      catalytic step. The ATP independence also supports the idea that this reaction 
      proceeds by a transesterification mechanism.

TI  - PRP19: a novel spliceosomal component.
PG  - 1876-82
AB  - We have isolated the gene of a splicing factor, PRP19, by complementation of the 
      temperature-sensitive growth defect of the prp19 mutant of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. The gene encodes a protein of 502 amino acid residues of molecular 
      weight 56,500, with no homology to sequences in the data base. Unlike other PRP 
      proteins or mammalian splicing factors, the sequence of PRP19 has no discernible 
      motif. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that PRP19 is associated with the 
      spliceosome during the splicing reaction. Although the exact function of PRP19 
      remains unknown, PRP19 appears to be distinct from the other PRP proteins or 
      other spliceosomal components.

TI  - A U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle protein involved only in the second 
      step of pre-mRNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 2959-70
AB  - The PRP18 gene, which had been identified in a screen for pre-mRNA splicing 
      mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been cloned and sequenced. Yeast strains 
      bearing only a disrupted copy of PRP18 are temperature sensitive for growth; even 
      at a low temperature, they grow extremely slowly and do not splice pre-mRNA 
      efficiently. This unusual temperature sensitivity can be reproduced in vitro; 
      extracts immunodepleted of PRP18 are temperature sensitive for the second step of 
      splicing. The PRP18 protein has been overexpressed in active form in Escherichia 
      coli and has been purified to near homogeneity. Antibodies directed against PRP18 
      precipitate the U4/U5/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) from 
      yeast extracts. From extracts depleted of the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), the 
      U4 and U5 snRNAs can be immunoprecipitated, while no snRNAs can be precipitated 
      from extracts depleted of the U5 snRNA. PRP18 therefore appears to be primarily 
      associated with the U5 snRNP. The antibodies against PRP18 inhibit the second 
      step of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. Together, these results imply that the U5 
      snRNP plays a role in the second step of splicing and suggest a model for the 
      action of PRP18.

TI  - A critical analysis of studies of state drug reimbursement policies: research in 
      need of discipline.
PG  - 217-52
AB  - Concerns over pharmaceutical costs and appropriateness of medication use have led 
      state Medicaid programs to restrict drug reimbursement. This article critically 
      reviews 20 years of research on cost sharing, drug reimbursement limits, and 
      administrative limitations on access to particular drugs via formularies, 
      category exclusions, or prior authorization requirements; evaluates their 
      methodological rigor; summarizes the state of current knowledge; and proposes 
      future research directions. Drug reimbursement caps and modest cost sharing can 
      reduce the use of both essential and less important drugs in Medicaid 
      populations; severe reimbursement caps may precipitate serious unintended 
      effects. Limitations on access to particular drugs can cause both rational and 
      irrational drug substitution effects; it is unclear whether such limits reduce 
      expenditures either for drugs or for overall health care.

TI  - In vitro trans-splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 11461-4
AB  - The interactions established at the 5'-splice site during spliceosome assembly 
      are likely to be important for both precise recognition of the upstream intron 
      boundary and for positioning this site in the active center of the spliceosome. 
      Definition of the RNA-RNA and the RNA-protein interactions at the 5' splice site 
      would be facilitated by the use of a small substrate amenable to modification 
      during chemical synthesis. We describe a trans-splicing reaction performed in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae extracts in which the 5' splice site and the 3' splice 
      site are on separate molecules. The RNA contributing the 5' splice site is only 
      20 nucleotides long and was synthesized chemically. The trans-splicing reaction 
      is accurate and has the same sequence, ATP, and Mg2+ requirements as 
      cis-splicing. We also report how deoxy substitutions around the 5'-splice site 
      affect trans-splicing efficiency.

TI  - Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in panic disorder: prediction of 
      long-term outcome by pretreatment cortisol levels.
PG  - 69-73
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to determine whether hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis activity in patients before their treatment for panic disorder can 
      predict follow-up functional status. Although baseline HPA axis disturbances in 
      patients with panic disorder appear to attenuate with treatment, there is 
      evidence that they may be linked to poorer long-term outcomes. METHOD: Follow-up 
      clinical data were obtained for 18 of 20 patients with panic disorder who 
      participated in a detailed study of HPA axis activity in panic, both before and 
      during their treatment with alprazolam. HPA axis assessment included monitoring 
      of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol over a full circadian cycle. The 
      relationships between disability and clinical status at 2-year follow-up and HPA 
      axis overactivity at entry were examined. RESULTS: Mean 24-hour cortisol levels 
      before treatment provided a strong, positive predictor of disability scores at 
      follow-up. Those patients who achieved the treatment goal of medication-free 
      remissions had less evidence of HPA axis overactivity at entry than those who 
      were not in remission. CONCLUSIONS: HPA axis activity before treatment did 
      predict outcome 2 years later. This relationship appears robust and reproducible. 
      Further work is needed to define the neuroendocrine mechanisms underlying the HPA 
      axis markers that are linked to long-term functioning and to determine the 
      biological, psychological, and social processes that link HPA axis disturbance to 
      poorer outcomes.

TI  - Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in panic disorder. 24-hour secretion 
      of corticotropin and cortisol.
PG  - 323-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oversecretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone and/or dysregulation 
      of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may contribute to 
      pathophysiologic processes in panic disorder, but documentation of HPA axis 
      disturbance in panic has been inconsistent. In the current study we examined HPA 
      axis activity in panic disorder over a full circadian cycle, using frequent blood 
      sampling to provide detailed assessment of corticotropin and cortisol secretion. 
      METHODS: Twenty patients with panic disorder and 12 normal control subjects were 
      studied. Blood samples were drawn every 15 minutes for 24 hours and assayed for 
      corticotropin and cortisol levels. RESULTS: Patients with panic disorder had 
      elevated overnight cortisol secretion and greater amplitude of ultradian 
      secretory episodes. Patients who entered the study through clinical referral 
      channels had greater cortisol secretion than those recruited by advertisements. 
      Patients with panic disorder who had a low frequency of panic attacks had 
      elevated daytime corticotropin levels and elevated corticotropin ultradian 
      amplitude. Patients with a high frequency of attacks had shifted corticotropin 
      circadian cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with panic disorder demonstrate subtle 
      alterations in HPA axis activity, characterized by overnight hypercortisolemia 
      and increased activity in ultradian secretory episodes, but HPA axis alterations 
      in panic are modulated by illness severity and treatment seeking. It remains 
      unclear whether HPA axis dysregulation in panic represents a pathogenic defect 
      within the axis itself. Inconsistencies in prior work may reflect the subtlety of 
      the abnormalities seen, differences in clinical characteristics of patients 
      studied, and the use of different probes and measurement contexts.

AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide neurotransmitter that was originally isolated 
      from the gastrointestinal system, but which is extensively and abundantly 
      distributed within the central nervous system (CNS). Stimulated by the fairly 
      recent recognition of receptor subtypes (A and B), and the development of 
      receptor-specific antagonists, CCK research has been advancing rapidly; and its 
      potential importance to psychiatric neuroscience has been increasingly 
      recognized. CCK participates in the mediation of satiety; it interacts with 
      dopamine and may modulate psychosis; it interacts with opiate systems and may be 
      an "anti-analgesic": and it appears to play a role in the mediation of anxiety. 
      Highly specific, CCK-B receptor antagonists have reached clinical trials and have 
      potential clinical utility as anxiolytics, antipsychotics, anti-anorexics, or 
      analgesics. There are grounds for excitement, but many obstacles remain to be 
      overcome and clinical potential may not be fulfilled. However, we must not allow 
      clinical disappointments to slow the accelerating pace of scientific progress in 
      CCK research. Regardless of clinical payoffs, the CCK receptor is clearly of 
      great importance to human CNS functioning and deserves ongoing scientific 
      attention.

TI  - HIV testing practices of primary care physicians: an Ontario survey.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - To determine whether physicians are knowledgeable about the risk factors 
      associated with HIV and whether perceived testing practices coincide with testing 
      guidelines, 1,236 physicians were surveyed about which patients they would 
      recommend for HIV testing. A total of 480 usable responses were obtained 
      (response rate of 50% of the eligible sample). Most would suggest testing to 
      partners of intravenous drug users, patients who received blood transfusions 
      between 1978 and 1985, homosexuals and bisexuals, and patients with more than two 
      sexually transmitted diseases. Only 46.4% would suggest testing to patients with 
      more than two sexual partners, and 65.8% would test anyone who asks. Other 
      patients to whom physicians would recommend testing were listed by 16.2%. 
      Logistic regression (F-step) was used to examine the relationship between 
      physician characteristics and likelihood of recommending testing. As a rule, 
      physicians are knowledgeable about the major risk factors and would recommend 
      testing according to guidelines. However, there may be a difference between 
      questionnaire responses and actual practice.

TI  - Shifting boundaries in professional care.
PG  - 364-71
AB  - The nature of the work undertaken by different health professionals and 
      inter-professional boundaries are constantly shifting. The greater knowledge of 
      users of health care, and the increasing technical and organizational complexity 
      of modern medicine, have partly eroded the control of health professionals over 
      the substance of their work. The definition of a field of work as lying within 
      the province of any one profession is culturally rather than scientifically 
      determined. It is evident that care of good quality should be delivered at the 
      lowest possible cost. This might include delivery of care by a less trained 
      person than heretofore, or by someone with limited but focused training. Sharing 
      of skills is a more sensible subject for discussion than transfer of tasks. We 
      review a number of studies which show the effectiveness of inter-professional 
      substitution in various care settings, and also the effectiveness of substitution 
      by those other than health professionals. The views of users of health services 
      on inter-professional substitution need to be considered. Health professionals 
      and others need to work together to devise innovative ways of delivering 
      effective health care. The legal issues need clarification.

TI  - 18S rRNA processing requires the RNA helicase-like protein Rrp3.
PG  - 3201-7
AB  - We report the identification of a new gene, RRP3 (rRNA processing), which is 
      required for pre-rRNA processing. Rrp3 is a 60.9 kDa protein that is required for 
      maturation of the 35S primary transcript of pre-rRNA and is required for 
      cleavages leading to mature 18S RNA. RRP3 was identified in a PCR screen for DEAD 
      box genes. DEAD box genes are part of a large family of proteins homologous to 
      the eukaryotic transcription factor elF-4a. Most of these proteins are 
      RNA-dependent ATPases and some of them have RNA helicase activity. This is the 
      third yeast DEAD box protein that has been shown to be involved in rRNA assembly, 
      but the only one required for the processing of 18S RNA. Mutants of the two other 
      putative helicases, Spb4 and Drsl, both show processing defects in 25S rRNA 
      maturation. In strains where Rrp3 is depleted, 35S precursor RNA is improperly 
      processed. Cleavage normally occurs at sites A0O, Al and A2, but in the Rrp3 
      depletion stain cleavage occurs between A2 and B1. Rrp3 has been purified to 
      homogeneity and has a weak RNA-dependent ATPase activity which is not specific 
      for rRNA.

TI  - An engineered Tetrahymena tRNAGln for in vivo incorporation of unnatural amino 
      acids into proteins by nonsense suppression.
PG  - 23169-75
AB  - A new tRNA, THG73, has been designed and evaluated as a vehicle for incorporating 
      unnatural amino acids site-specifically into proteins expressed in vivo using the 
      stop codon suppression technique. The construct is a modification of tRNAGln(CUA) 
      from Tetrahymena thermophila, which naturally recognizes the stop codon UAG. 
      Using electrophysiological studies of mutations at several sites of the nicotinic 
      acetylcholine receptor, it is established that THG73 represents a major 
      improvement over previous nonsense suppressors both in terms of efficiency and 
      fidelity of unnatural amino acid incorporation. Compared with a previous tRNA 
      used for in vivo suppression, THG73 is as much as 100-fold less likely to be 
      acylated by endogenous synthetases of the Xenopus oocyte. This effectively 
      eliminates a major concern of the in vivo suppression methodology, the 
      undesirable incorporation of natural amino acids at the suppression site. In 
      addition, THG73 is 4-10-fold more efficient at incorporating unnatural amino 
      acids in the oocyte system. Taken together, these two advances should greatly 
      expand the range of applicability of the in vivo nonsense suppression 
      methodology.

TI  - Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in panic disorder: effects of 
      alprazolam on 24 h secretion of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol.
PG  - 79-93
AB  - Pre-clinical and some clinical evidence suggests that central overdrive within 
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may play a role in panic disorder, 
      and that the anti-panic efficacy of alprazolam may involve its ability to inhibit 
      this drive. Detailed examination of 24 h secretion of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) 
      and cortisol in 20 panic patients had revealed subtle HPA axis abnormalities 
      prior to treatment. In order to determine whether these abnormalities resolve 
      with alprazolam therapy, these patients were re-studied over a full circadian 
      cycle after 12 weeks on alprazolam. Alprazolam produced substantial improvement 
      in clinical status which was accompanied by nearly full resolution of 
      pre-treatment hypercortisolemia. The impact of treatment on ACTH was more complex 
      and influenced by symptom severity. The results are consistent with the 
      hypotheses that HPA axis regulation is subtly disturbed in panic disorder and 
      that impact on the HPA axis may play a role in alprazolam's mechanism of 
      efficacy.

TI  - Platelet alpha 2-adrenoreceptors, catecholamines, hemodynamic variables, and 
      anxiety in panic patients and their asymptomatic relatives.
PG  - 289-301
AB  - The objectives of this study were to a) replicate our prior finding of a 
      decreased number (Bmax) of platelet alpha 2-adrenoreceptors in panic disorder, b) 
      determine if binding is also decreased in asymptomatic first-degree relatives of 
      panic patients (known to be at increased risk for developing panic), and c) 
      evaluate the effect of treatment on the presumptive decrease in binding (i.e., is 
      the decrease a state or a trait marker for panic?). Panic patients had clonidine 
      and yohimbine platelet-binding assays, symptom ratings, and measurement of lying 
      and standing plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, systolic and diastolic blood 
      pressure, and heart rate before treatment, after approximately 2 months of 
      medication (fluoxetine, tricyclics, or alprazolam) and/or cognitive behavioral 
      treatment, and after symptom remission while drug free; normal subjects had 
      determinations of the same measures at approximately the same time intervals. 
      Relatives of both groups had one determination only of all measures. Tritiated 
      clonidine binding was decreased and lying heart rate was increased in patients 
      before treatment. Magnitude of binding decrease was correlated with symptom 
      severity and standing norepinephrine. No binding abnormality was seen in 
      first-degree relatives of patients. Treatment increased clonidine binding in 
      patients. Both patients and relatives of patients showed significantly increased 
      standing plasma norepinephrine in comparison to controls. There is a 
      state-related decrease in binding, associated with symptom severity and 
      norepinephrine, in panic disorder. Abnormal reactivity of norepinephrine to 
      standing might be a marker for increased likelihood of panic development in 
      individuals at risk.

TI  - Respiratory psychophysiology and anxiety: cognitive intervention in the doxapram 
      model of panic.
PG  - 302-13
AB  - The goals of this study were to: a) confirm prior evidence that the respiratory 
      stimulant doxapram induces panic attacks and produces excessive hyperventilation 
      in patients with panic disorder and b) explore the impact of cognitive mediators 
      on symptom and respiratory responses. METHOD: Thirty-two subjects (16 patients 
      and 16 controls) received doxapram (0.5 mg/kg) and placebo infusions while 
      symptom, respiratory, and heart rate responses were monitored. Subjects were 
      randomly assigned to receive either a standard introduction or a cognitive 
      intervention designed to reduce the panic responses of panic patients to 
      laboratory challenges. RESULTS: Doxapram was a potent and specific panicogenic 
      agent, inducing panic in 75% of patients and 12.5% of controls. Compared with 
      controls, patients also showed a greater decrease in end tidal carbon dioxide 
      (CO2) and greater increases in minute ventilation, respiratory frequency, and 
      heart rate. The cognitive intervention substantially attenuated the excessive 
      hyperventilatory response of patients but did not fully normalize their breathing 
      patterns. Tidal volume was the only respiratory measure not significantly altered 
      by the cognitive intervention. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with panic disorder, 
      doxapram (0.5 mg/kg) triggers panic attacks about as potently as 7% CO2 and more 
      potently than 5% CO2 or lactate. Psychological factors can modulate the 
      appearance of ventilatory abnormalities in panic patients, but persistent 
      respiratory disturbances were still seen. Psychological factors and respiratory 
      physiology both appear to be important phenomena in laboratory panic.

TI  - Preventive care and barriers to effective prevention. How do family physicians 
      see it?
PG  - 1693-700
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess how adequately family physicians think they are delivering 
      preventive care and to examine barriers to providing preventive care. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Primary care medical practices in south-central 
      Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty family physicians and general 
      practitioners who graduated from medical school between 1972 and 1988. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfactory preventive care delivery versus self-assessed 
      coverage of patients for 15 preventive maneuvers. Perceived reasons for lack of 
      success in providing recommended preventive care. RESULTS: For 10 of the 15 
      maneuvers, the proportion of physicians who regarded 90% or higher as 
      satisfactory coverage was twice as great as the proportion who thought they 
      provided that level of coverage. For 11 of the 15 maneuvers, most respondents 
      reported coverage lower than the level they regarded as satisfactory. For six 
      maneuvers, more than two thirds thought they provided less than satisfactory 
      coverage. More than two thirds of respondents suggested these barriers to 
      providing recommended preventive care: patient is healthy and does not visit; 
      patient refuses, is not interested, or does not comply; no effective systems to 
      remind patients to come in for preventive care; and priority given to presenting 
      problem. CONCLUSION: Many family physicians and general practitioners in 
      south-central Ontario provide preventive care to their patients at lower levels 
      than they consider satisfactory. They identified barriers to providing preventive 
      services successfully; these barriers suggest approaches for improving care.

TI  - Neuroendocrine responses to laboratory panic: cognitive intervention in the 
      doxapram model.
PG  - 375-90
AB  - Doxapram is a respiratory stimulant that appears to be a potent and specific 
      panicogenic agent. It also elicits an abnormal ventilatory response in patients 
      with panic. A replication study confirmed these findings and demonstrated that 
      behavioral and ventilatory responses to doxapram were significantly modified by a 
      psychological intervention designed to cognitively block panic. The replication 
      study provided an opportunity to simultaneously investigate the neuroendocrine 
      effects of the illness, the drug, the drug-induced panic attacks, and the 
      cognitive intervention. Epinephrine (EPI), norepinephrine (NE), growth hormone 
      (GH), adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and cortisol were studied in patients with 
      panic and control subjects given placebo and doxapram injections after receiving 
      either standard instructions or a brief cognitive intervention. Patients with 
      panic had elevated levels of EPI, ACTH, and cortisol throughout the study. 
      Doxapram had little or no detectable effects on plasma NE, GH, ACTH, and 
      cortisol. Doxapram-induced panic attacks were not associated with elevations in 
      NE, GH, ACTH, or cortisol. Doxapram led to a rapid and very brief rise in plasma 
      EPI, which was small in subjects who did not panic and pronounced in patients who 
      did panic. The cognitive intervention attenuated the EPI response to doxapram, 
      perhaps through its effect on panic, and modified the temporal pattern of ACTH 
      and cortisol secretion. These results suggest that: (1) further study of 
      catecholamine responses within the first few minutes after panic induction is 
      needed; (2) intense panic can occur without significant activation of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; and (3) cognitive factors can modulate 
      neuroendocrine activity in laboratory studies of patients with panic.

TI  - Site-specific crosslinks of yeast U6 snRNA to the pre-mRNA near the 5' splice 
      site.
PG  - 995-1010
AB  - We have introduced a single photochemical crosslinking reagent into specific 
      sites in the central domain of U6 to identify the sites that are in close 
      proximity to the pre-mRNA substrate. Four distinct U6 snRNAs were synthesized 
      with a single 4-thiouridine (4-thioU) at positions 46, 51, 54, and 57, 
      respectively. Synthetic U6 RNA containing the 4-thioU modifications can 
      functionally reconstitute splicing activity in cell-free yeast splicing extracts 
      depleted of endogenous U6 snRNA. Upon photoactivation with UV (>300 nm), 4-thioU 
      at position 46 forms crosslinks to pre-mRNA near the 5' splice site at nt +4, +5, 
      +6, and +7 in the intron, whereas 4-thioU at position 51 crosslinks to the 
      pre-mRNA at positions -2, -1, +1, +2, +3, and at the invariant G in the lariat 
      intermediate. All crosslinks are dependent on the presence of ATP and the 
      splicing substrate. The two crosslinks to the pre-mRNA from position 46 and 51 of 
      U6 can also occur in prp2 heat-inactivated yeast splicing extracts blocked 
      immediately prior to the first chemical step. Significantly, the crosslink from 
      position 51 can undergo subsequent splicing when the mutant extract is 
      complemented with functional Prp2 protein in a chase experiment, indicating that 
      the crosslink reflects a functional interaction that is maintained during the 
      first step. The crosslink to lariat intermediate appears when the mutant 
      spliceosomes are complemented with functional Prp2 protein added exogenously. 
      This experiment is a paradigm for future studies in which different mutant 
      extracts are used to establish the stage in assembly at which particular RNA-RNA 
      interactions defined by unique crosslinks occur.

TI  - Lifetime prevalence, demographic risk factors, and diagnostic validity of 
      nonaffective psychosis as assessed in a US community sample. The National 
      Comorbidity Survey.
PG  - 1022-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: We seek to estimate lifetime prevalence and demographic correlates of 
      nonaffective psychosis in the US population assessed by a computer-analyzed 
      structured interview and a senior clinician. METHODS: In the National Comorbidity 
      Survey, a probability subsample of 5877 respondents were administered a screen 
      for psychotic symptoms. Based on the response to this screening, detailed 
      follow-up interviews were conducted by mental health professionals (n = 454). The 
      initial screen and clinical reinterview were reviewed by a senior clinician. 
      Results are presented for narrowly (schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder) 
      and broadly (all nonaffective psychoses) defined psychotic illness. RESULTS: One 
      or more psychosis screening questions were endorsed by 28.4% of individuals. By 
      computer algorithm, lifetime prevalences of narrowly and broadly defined 
      psychotic illness were 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively. Of those assigned a narrow 
      diagnosis by the computer, the senior clinician assigned narrow and broad 
      diagnoses to 10% and 37%, respectively. By clinician diagnosis, lifetime 
      prevalence rates of narrowly and broadly defined psychosis were 0.2% and 0.7%, 
      respectively. A clinician diagnosis of nonaffective psychosis was significantly 
      associated with low income; unemployment a marital status of single, divorced, or 
      separated; and urban residence Clinician confirmation of a computer diagnosis was 
      predicted by hospitalization, neuroleptic treatment, duration of illness, 
      enduring impairment, and thought disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime prevalence 
      estimates of psychosis in community samples are strongly influenced by methods of 
      assessment and diagnosis. Although results using computer algorithms were similar 
      in the National Comorbidity Survey and Epidemiologic Catchment Area studies, 
      diagnoses so obtained agreed poorly with clinical diagnoses. Accurate assessment 
      of psychotic illness in epidemiologic samples may require collection of extensive 
      contextual information for clinician review.

TI  - Reliability and procedural validity of UM-CIDI DSM-III-R phobic disorders.
PG  - 1169-77
AB  - We evaluate the long-term test-retest reliability and procedural validity of 
      phobia diagnoses in the UM-CIDI, the version of the Composite International 
      Diagnostic Interview, used in the US National Co-morbidity Survey (NCS) and a 
      number of other ongoing large-scale epidemiological surveys. Test-retest 
      reliabilities of lifetime diagnoses of simple phobia, social phobia, and 
      agoraphobia over a period between 16 and 34 months were K = 0.46, 0.47, and 0.63, 
      respectively. Concordances with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R 
      (SCID) were K = 0.45, 0.62, and 0.63, respectively. Diagnostic discrepancies with 
      the SCID were due to the UM-CIDI under-diagnosing. Post hoc analysis demonstrated 
      that modification of UM-CIDI coding rules could dramatically improve 
      cross-sectional procedural validity for both simple phobia (K = 0.57) and social 
      phobia (K = 0.95). Based on these results, it seems likely that future 
      modification of CIDI questions and coding rules could lead to substantial 
      improvements in diagnostic validity.

TI  - The 2'-5' RNA ligase of Escherichia coli. Purification, cloning, and genomic 
      disruption.
PG  - 31145-53
AB  - An RNA ligase previously detected in extracts of Escherichia coli is capable of 
      joining Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA splicing intermediates in the absence of 
      ATP to form a 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage (Greer, C., Javor, B., and Abelson, J. 
      (1983) Cell 33, 899-906). This enzyme specifically ligates tRNA half-molecules 
      containing nucleoside base modifications and shows a preference among different 
      tRNA species. In order to investigate the function of this enzyme in RNA 
      metabolism, the ligase was purified to homogeneity from E. coli lysate utilizing 
      chromatographic techniques and separation of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel 
      electrophoresis. A single polypeptide of approximately 20 kilodaltons exhibited 
      RNA ligase activity. The amino terminus of this protein was sequenced, and the 
      open reading frame (ORF) encoding it was identified by a data base search. This 
      ORF, which encodes a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 19.9 kDa, 
      was amplified from E. coli genomic DNA and cloned. ORFs coding for highly similar 
      proteins were detected in Methanococcus jannaschii and Bacillus 
      stearothermophilus. The chromosomal gene encoding RNA ligase in E. coli was 
      disrupted, abolishing ligase activity in cell lysates. Cells lacking ligase 
      activity grew normally under laboratory conditions. However, moderate 
      overexpression of the ligase protein led to slower growth rates and a 
      temperature-sensitive phenotype in both wild-type and RNA ligase knockout 
      strains. The RNA ligase reaction was studied in vitro using purified enzyme and 
      was found to be reversible, indicating that this enzyme may perform cleavage or 
      ligation in vivo.

TI  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp5 protein has RNA-dependent ATPase activity with 
      specificity for U2 small nuclear RNA.
PG  - 33261-7
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Prp5 is a member of the "DEAD box" family of 
      putative RNA-dependent ATPases and helicases. The protein was purified from 
      Escherichia coli and determined to be an RNA-dependent ATPase. The ATPase 
      activity is 7-fold more specific for full-length U2 than for any of the other 
      small nuclear RNAs or nonspecific RNAs tested. An RNaseH assay in extracts was 
      used to demonstrate that Prp5 mediates an ATP-dependent conformational change in 
      the intact U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. We propose that this 
      conformational change makes the branch point pairing sequence of U2 RNA 
      accessible for pairing with the intron allowing formation of the pre-spliceosome.

TI  - In vitro studies of the Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 complex indicate a pathway for U2 small 
      nuclear ribonucleoprotein activation.
PG  - 33268-76
AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing takes place on a large ribonucleoprotein particle, the 
      spliceosome which contains the five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), 
      U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the mRNA splicing factors, 
      Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21, are necessary for addition of the U2 snRNP to the 
      pre-mRNA in an early step of spliceosome assembly. This paper describes a study 
      of interactions between these proteins and their role in spliceosome assembly. 
      The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Prp9 and Prp11 were purified by 
      metal affinity chromatography. Prp21 was purified using a 
      solubilization/renaturation protocol. We have combined these separately purified 
      proteins and present direct evidence of a Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 protein complex that 
      is functional in in vitro splicing assays. Characteristics of this 
      Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 complex were further investigated using proteins synthesized in 
      vitro. In addition, we found that Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 influence the structure 
      of the U2 snRNP in a manner that alters the accessibility of the branch point 
      pairing region of the U2 snRNA to oligonucleotide- directed RNaseH cleavage. We 
      present a model, based on the data presented here and in the accompanying paper, 
      for a combined role of Prp9, Prp11, Prp21, and Prp5 in activating the U2 snRNP 
      for assembly into the pre-spliceosome.

TI  - Do female primary care physicians practise preventive care differently from their 
      male colleagues?
PG  - 2370-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether female primary care physicians' reported coverage of 
      patients eligible for certain preventive care strategies differs from male 
      physicians' reported coverage. DESIGN: A mailed survey. SETTING: Primary care 
      practices in southern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All primary care physicians who 
      graduated between 1972 and 1988 and practised in a defined geographic area of 
      Ontario were selected from the Canadian Medical Association's physician resource 
      database. Response rate was 50%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Answers to questions on 
      sociodemographic and practice characteristics, attitudes toward preventive care, 
      and perceptions about preventive care behaviour and practices. RESULTS: In 
      general, reported coverage for Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health 
      Examination's (CTFPHE) A and B class recommendations was low. However, more 
      female than male physicians reported high coverage of women patients for 
      female-specific preventive care measures (i.e., Pap smears, breast examinations, 
      and mammography) and for blood pressure measurement. Female physicians appeared 
      to question more patients about a greater number of health risks. Often, sex of 
      physician was the most salient factor affecting whether preventive care services 
      thought effective by the CTFPHE were offered. However, when evidence for 
      effectiveness of preventive services was equivocal or lacking, male and female 
      physicians reported similar levels of coverage. CONCLUSION: Female primary care 
      physicians are more likely than their male colleagues to report that their 
      patients eligible for preventive health measures as recommended by the CTFPHE 
      take advantage of these measures.

TI  - Adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol responses to corticotropin-releasing 
      hormone: changes in panic disorder and effects of alprazolam treatment.
PG  - 76-85
AB  - This study applied the corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation test to 
      patients with panic disorder, before and during treatment with alprazolam, and to 
      control subjects. In contrast to some, but not all prior studies, untreated, 
      nondepressed panic disorder patients failed to show blunted adrenocorticotropic 
      hormone or cortisol responses to CRH. In fact, the responses were subtly enhanced 
      in that they were more rapid than those of controls. After 12 weeks of alprazolam 
      treatment, repeat testing gave results that were indistinguishable from those of 
      controls. Inconsistency among reports of CRH testing in panic disorder may be 
      related to interactions among illness mechanisms, concurrent subthreshold 
      depressive symptoms, the chronic stress of the illness, and hyperresponsiveness 
      of panic patients to the acute stress of experimental manipulations. Pretreatment 
      abnormalities in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis function appear to resolve 
      with alprazolam treatment. Preliminary observations suggest that pretreatment 
      dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system may predict a more 
      difficult or less satisfactory treatment.

TI  - Site-specific deoxynucleotide substitutions in yeast U6 snRNA block splicing of 
      pre-mRNA in vitro.
PG  - 2119-29
AB  - We have identified 2'-hydroxyl groups of the U6 phosphate-ribose backbone which 
      are required for reconstitution of splicing activity in U6-depleted yeast 
      extract. To screen the 2'-hydroxyls of yeast U6 at nucleotides 39-88, spanning 
      the conserved central domain, synthetic U6 RNAs were constructed with 
      deoxyribonucleotides incorporated site specifically. Only four individual 
      deoxynucleotide substitutions blocked splicing activity: dA51 (in the ACAGAG 
      sequence), dA62 (next to the AGC triad), and dU70 and dC72 (both in the loop of 
      the 3' intramolecular stem-loop). Native gel analysis revealed that these 
      deoxy-substituted U6 RNAs were competent for assembly of spliceosomes. 
      Interestingly, a 2'-O-methyl substituent at A51, A62, U70 or C72 did not inhibit 
      splicing activity, indicating that the essential 2'-OH groups at these positions 
      in U6 act as hydrogen bond acceptors or neutral coordinated ligands. The 
      requisite 2'-hydroxyls at A62, U70 and C72 show both similarities and differences 
      relative to the positions of essential 2'-hydroxyls of catalytic domain V of 
      group II ribozymes. The identification of the essential 2'-hydroxyls at positions 
      62, 70 and 72 corroborates that the 3' intramolecular stem-loop in U6 plays an 
      important role in pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - The yeast tRNA splicing endonuclease: a tetrameric enzyme with two active site 
      subunits homologous to the archaeal tRNA endonucleases.
PG  - 849-58
AB  - The splicing of tRNA precursors is essential for the production of mature tRNA in 
      organisms from all major phyla. In yeast, the tRNA splicing endonuclease is 
      responsible for identification and cleavage of the splice sites in pre-tRNA. We 
      have cloned the genes encoding all four protein subunits of endonuclease. Each 
      gene is essential. Two subunits, Sen2p and Sen34p, contain a homologous domain of 
      approximately 130 amino acids. This domain is found in the gene encoding the 
      archaeal tRNA splicing endonuclease of H. volcanii and in other Archaea. Our 
      results demonstrate that the eucaryal tRNA splicing endonuclease contains two 
      functionally independent active sites for cleavage of the 5' and 3' splice sites, 
      encoded by SEN2 and SEN34, respectively. The presence of endonuclease in Eucarya 
      and Archaea suggests an ancient origin for the tRNA splicing reaction.

TI  - Childhood adversity and vulnerability to mood and anxiety disorders.
PG  - 66-72
AB  - Based upon epidemiological surveys, adverse childhood events are proposed to be 
      risk factors for adult depressive and anxiety disorders. However, the extent to 
      which these events are seen in clinical patient populations is less clear. We 
      examined the prevalence of a number of proposed risk factors for depression in 
      650 patients with mood and anxiety disorders at the time of presentation for 
      treatment in an outpatient subspecialty clinic. Emotional abuse, physical abuse, 
      or sexual abuse (childhood adversity) was found in approximately 35% of patients 
      with major depression and panic disorder, was more common in women than men, and 
      was associated with an earlier onset of symptoms. Childhood adversity was also 
      strongly associated with marital discord/divorce, and psychopathology in a 
      parent, suggesting family discord predisposes to childhood abuse. Furthermore, 
      the association of childhood abuse with parental mental illness suggests that 
      genetic and environmental factors are difficult to separate as etiological 
      factors in vulnerability.

TI  - The epidemiology of DSM-III-R bipolar I disorder in a general population survey.
PG  - 1079-89
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data are presented on the general population epidemiology of 
      DSM-III-R bipolar I disorder in the United States. METHODS: Data come from the US 
      National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a general population survey of DSM-III-R 
      disorders. A modified version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview 
      was used to make diagnoses. RESULTS: A small (N = 59) clinical reappraisal study 
      showed that the only manic symptom profile that could validly be assessed with 
      the CIDI is characterized by euphoria, grandiosity and the ability to maintain 
      energy without sleep, which described approximately half of all clinically 
      validated bipolar I cases in the NCS. Further analysis focused on this symptom 
      profile, which involved N = 29 cases in the total sample. Lifetime prevalence was 
      estimated to be 0.4% and 12-month prevalence only slightly lower. Caseness was 
      negatively related to income, education and age, positively related to 
      urbanicity, and elevated among the previously married, never married and 
      non-whites. All cases reported at least one other NCS/DSM-III-R disorder and 
      59.3% reported that their episode of bipolar disorder (either mania or 
      depression) occurred at a later age than at least one other NCS/DSM-III-R 
      disorder. Although 93.2% of lifetime cases reported some lifetime treatment, only 
      44.7% of recent cases were in treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The type of bipolar 
      disorder examined here is highly chronic, co-morbid and impairing. Increased 
      efforts are required to attract current cases into appropriate treatment. 
      Methodological research is needed to develop more accurate measures of other 
      bipolar symptom profiles for use in general population epidemiological studies.

TI  - Prp43: An RNA helicase-like factor involved in spliceosome disassembly.
PG  - 11798-802
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes PRP2, PRP16, and PRP22 encode pre-mRNA 
      splicing factors that belong to the highly conserved "DEAH" family of putative 
      RNA helicases. We previously identified two additional members of this family, 
      JA1 and JA2. To investigate its biological function, we cloned the JA1 gene and 
      generated alleles carrying mutations identical to those found in highly conserved 
      regions of other members of the DEAH family. A ja1 allele carrying a mutation 
      identical to that in the temperature-sensitive (ts) prp22-1 gene conferred ts 
      phenotype when integrated into the genome of a wild-type strain by gene 
      replacement. Northern analysis of RNA obtained from the ts strain shifted to a 
      nonpermissive temperature revealed accumulation of unspliced pre-mRNAs and 
      excised intron lariats. Furthermore, analysis of splicing complexes showed that 
      intron lariats accumulated in spliceosomes. The results presented indicate that 
      JA1 encodes a pre-mRNA processing factor (Prp) involved in disassembly of 
      spliceosomes after the release of mature mRNA. We have therefore renamed this 
      gene PRP43.

TI  - Provision of preventive care to unannounced standardized patients.
PG  - 185-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between physician, training and practice 
      characteristics and the provision of preventive care as described in the 
      guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open to new patients within 1 
      hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 125 family physicians 
      were randomly selected from respondents to an earlier preventive care survey. Of 
      the 125, 44 (35.2%) declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) 
      initially consented but later withdrew when they closed their practices to new 
      patients. Sixty-two physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: 
      Unannounced standardized patients posing as new patients to the practice visited 
      study physicians' practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 
      scenarios: 48-year-old man, 70-year-old man, 28-year-old woman and 52-year-old 
      woman. OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of preventive care manoeuvres carrying grade 
      A, B, C, D and E recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic 
      Health Examination that were performed, offered or advised. A standard score was 
      computed based on the performance of grade A and B manoeuvres (good or fair 
      evidence for inclusion in the periodic health examination) and the 
      non-performance of grade D and E manoeuvres (fair or good evidence for exclusion 
      from the periodic health examination). RESULTS: Study physicians performed or 
      offered 65.6% of applicable grade A manoeuvres, 31.0% of grade B manoeuvres, 
      22.4% of grade C manoeuvres, 21.8% of grade D manoeuvres and 4.9% of grade E 
      manoeuvres. The provision of evidence-based preventive care was associated with 
      solo (v. group) practice and capitation or salary (v. fee-for-service) payment 
      method. Preventive care performance was unrelated to physician's sex, 
      certification in family medicine or problem-based (v. traditional) medical school 
      curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive care guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on 
      the Periodic Health Examination have been incompletely integrated into clinical 
      practice. Research is needed to identify and reduce barriers to the provision of 
      preventive care and to develop and apply effective processes for the creation, 
      dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines.

TI  - What factors influence primary care physicians' charges for their services? An 
      exploratory study using standardized patients.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of variation in physicians' charges for health 
      care encounters with unannounced standardized patients and factors associated 
      with the variation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open 
      to new patients within 1 hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      stratified random sample of 125 physicians who had responded to an earlier survey 
      regarding preventive care were invited to participate. Of the 125, 44 (35.2%) 
      declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) initially consented but 
      later withdrew because they closed their practices to new patients. Sixty-two 
      physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: Unannounced standardized 
      patients posing as new patients to the practice visited study physicians' 
      practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 scenarios: 
      28-year-old woman, 52-year-old woman, 48-year-old man and 70-year-old man. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician characteristics, encounter characteristics and 
      charges made for services. RESULTS: The 62 physicians had 246 encounters with the 
      standardized patients. Charges were made to the health insurance plan for 
      services by 59 physicians for up to 4 encounters (215 encounters in all). Charges 
      varied considerably both within and across patient scenarios. Time spent with the 
      patient was an important factor predicting charges made (p < 0.01), although the 
      effect of time spent on charges varied across scenarios (p < 0.01). 
      Fee-for-service physicians charged more for their services than physicians who 
      usually had alternative billing arrangements (p < 0.01). Female physicians 
      charged more for their services than their male colleagues (p = 0.03). No 
      relation was found between quality of preventive care and charges made (p = 
      0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Physician-related factors are better able to account for the 
      variability in charges for their services than patient-related factors. 
      Physicians seeing comparable patients may earn much more or less than their 
      colleagues because of differences in the services they provide and the way they 
      apply the fee schedule. Quality-assurance techniques are likely needed to reduce 
      the variability in charges seen and increase value for money spent in health 
      care.

TI  - Evolution of a transfer RNA gene through a point mutation in the anticodon.
PG  - 1665-70
AB  - The transfer RNA (tRNA) multigene family comprises 20 amino acid-accepting 
      groups, many of which contain isoacceptors. The addition of isoacceptors to the 
      tRNA repertoire was critical to establishing the genetic code, yet the origin of 
      isoacceptors remains largely unexplored. A model of tRNA evolution, termed "tRNA 
      gene recruitment," was formulated. It proposes that a tRNA gene can be recruited 
      from one isoaccepting group to another by a point mutation that concurrently 
      changes tRNA amino acid identity and messenger RNA coupling capacity. A test of 
      the model showed that an Escherichia coli strain, in which the essential 
      tRNAUGUThr gene was inactivated, was rendered viable when a tRNAArg with a point 
      mutation that changed its anticodon from UCU to UGU (threonine) was expressed. 
      Insertion of threonine at threonine codons by the "recruited" tRNAArg was 
      corroborated by in vitro aminoacylation assays showing that its specificity had 
      been changed from arginine to threonine. Therefore, the recruitment model may 
      account for the evolution of some tRNA genes.

TI  - Crystal structure and evolution of a transfer RNA splicing enzyme.
PG  - 279-84
AB  - The splicing of transfer RNA precursors is similar in Eucarya and Archaea. In 
      both kingdoms an endonuclease recognizes the splice sites and releases the 
      intron, but the mechanism of splice site recognition is different in each 
      kingdom. The crystal structure of the endonuclease from the archaeon 
      Methanococcus jannaschii was determined to a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. The 
      structure indicates that the cleavage reaction is similar to that of ribonuclease 
      A and the arrangement of the active sites is conserved between the archaeal and 
      eucaryal enzymes. These results suggest an evolutionary pathway for splice site 
      recognition.

TI  - Defense mechanism changes in successfully treated patients with 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 558-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Changes in defense mechanisms after treatment of patients with 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) were measured by using an established rating 
      scale. METHOD: Before and after 7-week group behavior therapy, 17 patients with 
      DSM-III-R OCD were assessed with the Defense Style Questionnaire, Yale-Brown 
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS: After 
      behavior therapy the patients evidenced significant decreases in Yale-Brown 
      Obsessive Compulsive Scale scores and significant increases in the use of more 
      adaptive defense mechanisms. There were no significant changes in three 
      maladaptive defense mechanism categories. The improvement in adaptive defenses 
      was independently linked to improvement both in OCD and in depression. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Personality as defined by defense mechanisms may be more amenable to 
      brief behavioral treatment than previously thought. The permanence of these 
      changes must be further assessed.

TI  - The DEAH-box protein PRP22 is an ATPase that mediates ATP-dependent mRNA release 
      from the spliceosome and unwinds RNA duplexes.
PG  - 2926-37
AB  - Of the proteins required for pre-mRNA splicing, at least four, the DEAH-box 
      proteins, are closely related due to the presence of a central 'RNA 
      helicase-like' region, and extended homology through a large portion of the 
      protein. A major unresolved question is the function of these proteins. Indirect 
      evidence suggests that several of these proteins are catalysts for important 
      structural rearrangements in the spliceosome. However, the mechanism for the 
      proposed alterations is presently unknown. We present evidence that PRP22, a 
      DEAH-box protein required for mRNA release from the spliceosome, unwinds RNA 
      duplexes in a concentration- and ATP-dependent manner. This demonstrates that 
      PRP22 can modify RNA structure directly. We also show that the PRP22-dependent 
      release of mRNA from the spliceosome is an ATP-dependent process and that 
      recombinant PRP22 is an ATPase. Non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs did not substitute 
      for ATP in the RNA-unwinding reaction, suggesting that ATP hydrolysis is required 
      for this reaction. Specific mutation of a putative ATP phosphate-binding motif in 
      the recombinant protein eliminated the ATPase and RNA-unwinding capacity. 
      Significantly, these data suggest that the DEAH-box proteins act directly on RNA 
      substrates within the spliceosome.

TI  - Fielding standardized patients in primary care settings: lessons from a study 
      using unannounced standardized patients to assess preventive care practices.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document detection and suspicion rates of unannounced standardized 
      patients visiting community-based practices. DESIGN: Primary care physicians were 
      recruited to participate in a study using standardized patients. Four 
      standardized patient scenarios were used. SETTING: Community-based primary care 
      physicians' practices in southern Ontario between September 1994 and August 1995. 
      STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two primary care physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 
      'believability' questionnaire completed after all four standardized patients had 
      visited the practices. RESULTS: Of the primary care physicians approached, 50% 
      (62) agreed to participate. Twenty-one per cent of all visits were suspected as 
      standardized patient encounters. Forty-six per cent suspected one or more 
      standardized patients. Only five physicians (8%) suspected all four standardized 
      patients. Reasons for suspecting standardized patients were associated with the 
      characteristics of the physician's practices, the physician's practice profile 
      and the standardized patient cover story. CONCLUSION: The portrayal of 
      asymptomatic patients seeking a new primary care physician presents unique 
      challenges. Carefully constructed cover stories, and detailed knowledge of the 
      local area and of the practices of the participating physicians is required to 
      allow standardized patients cases to be tailored to fit into primary care 
      settings without arousing suspicion.

AB  - Given the task of distributing scarce resources, decision makers are faced with 
      the question of how to involve an increasingly threatened and disenfranchised 
      public in decisions affecting their communities. This article introduces a 
      systematic approach to public involvement in community decision-making and 
      identifies key elements in the design of institutional driven public 
      participation exercises. Examples are drawn from the health care system 
      restructuring experiences of three Ontario communities.

      identification of its proteins.
PG  - 7226-31
AB  - The yeast U4/U6.U5 pre-mRNA splicing small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is a 
      25S small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle similar in size, composition, and 
      morphology to its counterpart in human cells. The yeast U4/U6.U5 snRNP complex 
      has been purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography and preparative 
      glycerol gradient sedimentation. We show that there are at least 24 proteins 
      stably associated with this particle and performed mass spectrometry 
      microsequencing to determine their identities. In addition to the seven canonical 
      core Sm proteins, there are a set of U6 snRNP specific Sm proteins, eight 
      previously described U4/U6.U5 snRNP proteins, and four novel proteins. Two of the 
      novel proteins have likely RNA binding properties, one has been implicated in the 
      cell cycle, and one has no identifiable sequence homologues or functional motifs. 
      The purification of the low abundance U4/U6.U5 snRNP from yeast and the powerful 
      sequencing methodologies using small amounts of protein make possible the rapid 
      identification of novel and previously unidentified components of large, 
      low-abundance macromolecular machines from any genetically manipulable organism.

TI  - Neuroendocrine and psychophysiologic responses in PTSD: a symptom provocation 
      study.
PG  - 40-50
AB  - Biological research on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has focused on 
      autonomic, sympatho-adrenal, and hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      systems. Interactions among these response modalities have not been well studied 
      and may be illuminating. We examined subjective, autonomic, adrenergic, and HPA 
      axis responses in a trauma-cue paradigm and explored the hypothesis that the 
      ability of linked stress-response systems to mount integrated responses to 
      environmental threat would produce strong correlations across systems. Seventeen 
      veterans with PTSD, 11 veteran controls without PTSD, and 14 nonveteran controls 
      were exposed to white noise and combat sounds on separate days. Subjective 
      distress, heart rate, skin conductance, plasma catecholamines, ACTH, and 
      cortisol, at baseline and in response to the auditory stimuli, were analyzed for 
      group differences and for patterns of interrelationships. PTSD patients exhibited 
      higher skin conductance, heart rate, plasma cortisol, and catecholamines at 
      baseline, and exaggerated responses to combat sounds in skin conductance, heart 
      rate, plasma epinephrine, and norepinephrine, but not ACTH. The control groups 
      did not differ on any measure. In canonical correlation analyses, no significant 
      correlations were found between response systems. Thus, PTSD patients showed 
      heightened responsivity to trauma-related cues in some, but not all, response 
      modalities. The data did not support the integrated, multisystem stress response 
      in PTSD that had been hypothesized. Individual response differences or differing 
      pathophysiological processes may determine which neurobiological system is 
      affected in any given patient.

TI  - Effect of alcohol on social phobic anxiety.
PG  - 1237-43
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Previous research has demonstrated a greater-than-expected association 
      between social phobia and alcohol use disorders. The purpose of this study was to 
      test the hypothesis that drinking alcohol reduces social phobic anxiety. METHOD: 
      Treatment-seeking individuals with social phobia (N = 40) were asked to give two 
      impromptu speeches. Twenty subjects received a placebo alcoholic drink before 
      both speeches, and 20 subjects received a placebo before the first speech, 
      followed by a moderate dose of alcohol before the second speech. Subjective 
      anxiety ratings, heart rate, and cognitions related to social anxiety were used 
      as measures of anxiety. RESULTS: Repeated measures analyses of variance yielded 
      no significant differences in anxiety (subjective, physiological, cognitive) 
      between the alcohol and placebo groups. Current and past drinking habits did not 
      significantly alter the effect of alcohol on anxiety. The belief that one 
      received alcohol was significantly related to levels of subjective anxiety and 
      negative cognitions. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol does not directly reduce social phobic 
      anxiety. The belief that one received alcohol may reduce social anxiety.

TI  - Dose response of adrenocorticotropin and cortisol to the CCK-B agonist 
      pentagastrin.
PG  - 485-94
AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) is an abundant neurotransmitter in brain. Its functional 
      significance in humans is incompletely understood, but it may modulate activity 
      in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. To explore this hypothesis, we 
      examined the effects of varying doses (0 to 0.8 microgram/kg) of the CCK-B 
      agonist pentagastrin on adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol release in 
      healthy human subjects. We also examined anxiety, heart rate (HR), and blood 
      pressure (BP) responses. Pentagastrin induced large (up to 520% increase over 
      baseline), significant and very rapid, dose-dependent elevations in ACTH and 
      cortisol levels. Significant elevations in HR and BP were seen at all doses, 
      without clear dose-response relationships. Anxious distress and symptom responses 
      were also somewhat dose dependent; but hormonal responses were more robustly 
      linked to pentagastrin dose than to these subjective measures. The HPA axis 
      response to the CCK-B agonist pentagastrin may be a direct pharmacological 
      effect. Further work is needed to determine the mechanisms and the physiological 
      significance of CCK-mediated modulation of the human neuroendocrine stress axis.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence determination of bacteriophage T4 glycine transfer 
      ribonucleic acid.
PG  - 1287-304
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a T4 tRNA with an anticodon for glycine has been 
      determined using (32)P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of 
      Escherichiacoli. The sequence is: 
      pGCGGAUAUCGUAUAAUGmGDAUUACCUCAGACUUCCAApsiCUGAUGAUGUGAGTpsiCGAUUCUCAUUAUCCGCUCCA-OH. 
      The 74 nucleotide sequence can be arranged in the classic cloverleaf pattern for 
      tRNAs. The anticodon of T4 tRNA(Gly) is UCC with a possible modification of the 
      U. The tRNA molecule would thus be expected to recognize the glycine codons GGG 
      and GGA. Comparative analysis of tRNAs(Gly) from T2 and T6 indicate that their 
      sequences are identical with that from T4.

TI  - tRNA leucine identity and recognition sets.
PG  - 779-93
AB  - Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are grouped into two classes based on the structure of 
      their variable loop. In Escherichia coli, tRNAs from three isoaccepting groups 
      are classified as type II. Leucine tRNAs comprise one such group. We used both in 
      vivo and in vitro approaches to determine the nucleotides that are required for 
      tRNA(Leu) function. In addition, to investigate the role of the tRNA fold, we 
      compared the in vivo and in vitro characteristics of type I tRNA(Leu) variants 
      with their type II counterparts.A minimum of six conserved tRNA(Leu) nucleotides 
      were required to change the amino acid identity and recognition of a type II 
      tRNA(Ser) amber suppressor from a serine to a leucine residue. Five of these 
      nucleotides affect tRNA tertiary structure; the G15-C48 tertiary "Levitt 
      base-pair" in tRNA(Ser) was changed to A15-U48; the number of nucleotides in the 
      alpha and beta regions of the D-loop was changed to achieve the positioning of 
      G18 and G19 that is found in all tRNA(Leu); a base was inserted at position 47n 
      between the base-paired extra stem and the T-stem; in addition the G73 
      "discriminator" base of tRNA(Ser) was changed to A73. This minimally altered 
      tRNA(Ser) exclusively inserted leucine residues and was an excellent in vitro 
      substrate for LeuRS. In a parallel experiment, nucleotide substitutions were made 
      in a glutamine-inserting type I tRNA (RNA(SerDelta); an amber suppressor in which 
      the tRNA(Ser) type II extra-stem-loop is replaced by a consensus type I loop). 
      This "type I" swap experiment was successful both in vivo and in vitro but 
      required more nucleotide substitutions than did the type II swap. The type I and 
      II swaps revealed differences in the contributions of the tRNA(Leu) acceptor stem 
      base-pairs to tRNA(Leu) function: in the type I, but not the type II fold, 
      leucine specificity was contingent on the presence of the tRNA(Leu) acceptor stem 
      sequence. The type I and II tRNAs used in this study differed only in the 
      sequence and structure of the variable loop. By altering this loop, and thereby 
      possibly introducing subtle changes into the overall tRNA fold, it became 
      possible to detect otherwise cryptic contributions of the acceptor stem sequence 
      to recognition by LeuRS. Possible reasons for this effect are discussed.

TI  - Crystal structure of a dimeric archaeal splicing endonuclease.
PG  - 639-48
AB  - The splicing endonuclease from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF) belongs to the 
      homodimeric family of splicing endonucleases, thought to have evolved from the 
      homotetrameric endonucleases. We report here the crystal structure of the AF 
      endonuclease determined at 2.8 A. The crystal structure of the full-length AF 
      endonuclease contains a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of two homologous 
      repeats joined together by an extended polypeptide chain of ten amino acid 
      residues. The C-terminal repeat has a strong homology to that of a single subunit 
      of the previously determined homotetrameric tRNA splicing endonuclease from 
      Methanococcus jannaschii (MJ), indicating its role in catalysis. The N-terminal 
      repeat is a more degenerate form of the MJ enzyme. Thus the N-terminal repeat is 
      a "non-active" endonuclease fold evolved from the "active" one. By detailed 
      comparison of the structures of the N-terminal and the C-terminal repeats, the 
      binding region for RNA substrates containing a bulge-helix-bulge motif can be 
      identified. Based on the identified RNA-binding region, a cation-pi interaction 
      is suggested to be responsible for coordinating activities between the two active 
      sites. In addition, the full-length AF endonuclease can adopt a higher-ordered 
      fibrous structure in solution, as revealed by the unusual crystallographic 
      packing interactions and other biochemical analysis. This 4(3)-fold fibrous 
      structure adopted by the full-length enzyme is inaccessible to the RNA substrate 
      and is largely stabilized by the first 60 amino acid residues. A mutated form of 
      AF endonuclease with its first 60 residues removed catalyzes the cleavage 
      reaction at a significantly higher rate. Whether there is any role in vivo for 
      this structure-mediated modulation of activity remains to be determined.

TI  - Dose response of arginine vasopressin to the CCK-B agonist pentagastrin.
PG  - 161-9
AB  - Cholecystokinin (CCK) is a peptide neurotransmitter that modulates 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and may be involved in fear or 
      anxiety states. Arginine vasopressin (AVP) also modulates HPA axis activity and 
      may play a role in fear conditioning. Few human studies have examined 
      interactions between CCK and AVP systems. To explore relationships between CCK-B 
      receptor activation, the HPA axis response, and AVP release, a dose-response 
      study using the CCK-B receptor agonist pentagastrin was conducted. 
      Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol results have been previously reported and 
      AVP data is presented here. Thirty-five healthy subjects were randomly assigned 
      to receive placebo, or 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, or 0.8 microg/kg doses of pentagastrin. AVP 
      release appeared to increase with increasing doses of the CCK-B agonist. However, 
      this may have been due to a greater percentage of subjects releasing AVP in the 
      higher dose groups, rather than a direct effect of dose on magnitude of response. 
      AVP and ACTH responses were correlated, but AVP response alone could not account 
      for the magnitude of the ACTH response. AVP release was significantly correlated 
      with anxiety symptom responses. These findings suggest a possible role for the 
      CCK-B receptor in AVP release, which may be at least partially separate from its 
      role in modulation of the HPA axis. Further work is needed to determine whether 
      these are physiologically meaningful interactions and to determine their 
      functional implications.

TI  - Crystal structure of a DEAD box protein from the hyperthermophile Methanococcus 
      jannaschii.
PG  - 1465-70
AB  - We have determined the structure of a DEAD box putative RNA helicase from the 
      hyperthermophile Methanococcus jannaschii. Like other helicases, the protein 
      contains two alpha/beta domains, each with a recA-like topology. Unlike other 
      helicases, the protein exists as a dimer in the crystal. Through an interaction 
      that resembles the dimer interface of insulin, the amino-terminal domain's 
      7-strand beta-sheet is extended to 14 strands across the two molecules. Motifs 
      conserved in the DEAD box family cluster in the cleft between domains, and many 
      of their functions can be deduced by mutational data and by comparison with other 
      helicase structures. Several lines of evidence suggest that motif III Ser-Ala-Thr 
      may be involved in binding RNA.

TI  - Persistent respiratory irregularity in patients with panic disorder.
PG  - 588-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysregulated respiratory control may play a role in the 
      pathophysiology of panic disorder. This could be due to abnormalities in brain 
      stem respiratory nuclei or to dysregulation at higher brain levels. Results from 
      previous studies using the doxapram model of panic have yielded an unclear 
      picture. A brief cognitive manipulation reduced doxapram-induced hyperventilation 
      in patients, suggesting that higher level inputs can substantially alter their 
      respiratory patterns. However, respiratory abnormalities persisted, including a 
      striking irregularity in breathing patterns. METHODS: To directly study 
      respiratory irregularity, breath-by-breath records of tidal volume (V(t)) and 
      frequency (f) from previously studied subjects were obtained. Irregularity was 
      quantified using von Neumann's statistic and calculation of "sigh" frequency in 
      16 patients and 16 matched control subjects. Half of each group received a 
      standard introduction to the study and half received a cognitive intervention 
      designed to reduce anxiety/distress responses to the doxapram injection. RESULTS: 
      Patients had significantly greater V(t) irregularity relative to control 
      subjects. Neither the cognitive intervention nor doxapram-induced 
      hyperventilation produced significant changes in V(t) irregularity. The V(t) 
      irregularity was attributable to a sighing pattern of breathing that was 
      characteristic of panic patients but not control subjects. Patients also had 
      somewhat elevated f irregularity relative to control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      irregular breathing patterns in panic patients appear to be intrinsic and stable, 
      uninfluenced by induced hyperventilation or cognitive manipulation. Further study 
      of V(t) irregularity and sighs are warranted in efforts to localize dysregulated 
      neural circuits in panic to brain stem or midbrain levels.

TI  - Group behavioral therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder: seven vs. twelve-week 
      outcomes.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that individualized behavioral exposure and 
      response prevention therapy is an effective treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive 
      Disorder. In our prior preliminary report, 7-week group exposure and response 
      prevention therapy was also found effective in reducing obsessions and 
      compulsions. The present report describes a larger sample (N=113) of treatment 
      seeking obsessive-compulsives who received group behavioral therapy. As before, 
      group exposure and response prevention significantly improved ratings of 
      obsessions, compulsions, and depression. These improvements were maintained at 
      3-month and long-term follow-up. A sub-sample of patients who received 12 weeks 
      of treatment had outcomes at the end of the group and at follow-up that did not 
      significantly differ from those who received 7 weeks of treatment. These results

TI  - Absence of an abrupt phase change from polycrystalline to amorphous in silicon 
      with deposition temperature.
PG  - 5514-7
AB  - Using fluctuation electron microscopy, we have observed an increase in the 
      mesoscopic spatial fluctuations in the diffracted intensity from vapor-deposited 
      silicon thin films as a function of substrate temperature from the amorphous to 
      polycrystalline regimes. We interpret this increase as an increase in 
      paracrystalline medium-range order in the sample. A paracrystal consists of 
      topologically crystalline grains in a disordered matrix; in this model the 
      increase in ordering is caused by an increase in the grain size or density. Our 
      observations are counter to the previous belief that the amorphous to 
      polycrystalline transition is a discontinuous disorder-order phase transition.

TI  - Characterization of U4 and U6 interactions with the 5' splice site using a S. 
      cerevisiae in vitro trans-splicing system.
PG  - 1957-70
AB  - Spliceosome assembly has been characterized as the ordered association of the 
      snRNP particles U1, U2, and U4/U6.U5 onto pre-mRNA. We have used an in vitro 
      trans-splicing/cross-linking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear extracts 
      to examine the first step of this process, 5' splice site recognition. This 
      trans-splicing reaction has ATP, Mg(2+), and splice-site sequence requirements 
      similar to those of cis-splicing reactions. Using this system, we identified and 
      characterized a novel U4-5' splice site interaction that is ATP-dependent, but 
      does not require the branch point, the 3' splice site, or the 5' end of the U1 
      snRNA. Additionally, we identified several ATP-dependent U6 cross-links at the 5' 
      splice site, indicating that different regions of U6 sample it before a U6-5' 
      splice site interaction is stabilized that persists through the first step of 
      splicing. This work provides evidence for ATP-dependent U4/U6 association with 
      the 5' splice site independent of ATP-mediated U2 association with the branch 
      point. Furthermore, it defines specific nucleotides in U4 and U6 that interact 
      with the 5' splice site at this early stage, even in the absence of base-pairing 
      with the U1 snRNA.

TI  - Understanding the role of contextual influences on local health-care decision 
      making: case study results from Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 777-93
AB  - Approaches to involving the public in local health care decision making processes 
      (and analyses of these approaches) have tended to treat participation and publics 
      uniformly in search of the ideal method of involving the public or providing the 
      same opportunities for public participation regardless of differing 
      socio-economic, cultural, insitutional or political contexts within which 
      decisions are made. Less attention has been given to the potential for various 
      contextual factors to influence both the methods employed and the outcomes of 
      such community decision-making processes. The paper explores the role that 
      context (three sets of contextual influences more specifically) plays in shaping 
      community decision-making processes. Results from case studies of public 
      participation in local health-care decision making in four geographic communities 
      in Ontario are presented. During the study period, two of these communities were 
      actively involved in health services restructuring processes while one had 
      recently completed its process and the fourth had not yet engaged in one. Several 
      themes emerge from the case studies regarding the identification and role of 
      contextual influences in differentially shaping participation in local health 
      care decision-making. These include the propensity for communities with different 
      social and structural attributes to engage in different "styles" of 
      participation; the importance attached to "community values" in shaping both the 
      qualitative and quantitative aspects of participation: the role of health 
      councils, local government and inter-organizational collaboration as 
      participation "enablers"; and the politicization of participation that occurs 
      around contentious issues such as hospital closures.

TI  - Primary care in Canada: so much innovation, so little change.
PG  - 116-31
AB  - The development of Canadian primary care has been shaped by a series of policy 
      legacies that continue to affect the possibilities for change in primary care 
      through their cumulative effects on the health care system and the process of 
      health policy development. The pursuit of radical systemwide change in the face 
      of unfavorable circumstances (created in large part by those legacies) has 
      resulted in missed opportunities for cumulative incremental change. While major 
      changes in primary care policy seem unlikely in the near future, significant 
      incremental change is possible, but it will require a reorientation of the policy 
      development process.

TI  - Biochemical and genetic analyses of the U5, U6, and U4/U6 x U5 small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1543-53
AB  - We have purified the yeast U5 and U6 pre-mRNA splicing small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) by affinity chromatography and analyzed the 
      associated polypeptides by mass spectrometry. The yeast U5 snRNP is composed of 
      the two variants of U5 snRNA, six U5-specific proteins and the 7 proteins of the 
      canonical Sm core. The U6 snRNP is composed of the U6 snRNA, Prp24, and the 7 
      Sm-Like (LSM) proteins. Surprisingly, the yeast DEAD-box helicase-like protein 
      Prp28 is stably associated with the U5 snRNP, yet is absent from the purified 
      U4/U6 x U5 snRNP. A novel yeast U5 and four novel yeast U4/U6 x U5 snRNP 
      polypeptides were characterized by genetic and biochemical means to demonstrate 
      their involvement in the pre-mRNA splicing reaction. We also show that, unlike 
      the human tri-snRNP, the yeast tri-snRNP dissociated upon addition of ATP or 
      dATP.

TI  - Composition and functional characterization of the yeast spliceosomal 
      penta-snRNP.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - Pre-mRNA introns are spliced in a macromolecular machine, the spliceosome. For 
      each round of splicing, the spliceosome assembles de novo in a series of 
      ATP-dependent steps involving numerous changes in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein 
      interactions. As currently understood, spliceosome assembly proceeds by addition 
      of discrete U1, U2, and U4/U6*U5 snRNPs to a pre-mRNA substrate to form 
      functional splicing complexes. We characterized a 45S yeast penta-snRNP which 
      contains all five spliceosomal snRNAs and over 60 pre-mRNA splicing factors. The 
      particle is functional in extracts and, when supplied with soluble factors, is 
      capable of splicing pre-mRNA. We propose that the spliceosomal snRNPs associate 
      prior to binding of a pre-mRNA substrate rather than with pre-mRNA via stepwise 
      addition of discrete snRNPs.

TI  - Examining the role of health services research in public policymaking.
PG  - 125-54
AB  - Conceptual, methodological, and practical issues await those who seek to 
      understand how to make better use of health services research in developing 
      public policy. Some policies and some policymaking processes may lend themselves 
      particularly well to being informed by research. Different conclusions about the 
      extent to which policymaking is informed by research may arise from different 
      views about what constitutes health services research (is it citable research or 
      any professional social inquiry that can aid in problem solving?) or different 
      views about what constitutes research use (is it explicit uses of research only, 
      or does it also include tacit knowledge or the positions of stakeholders when 
      they are informed by research and are influential in the policymaking process?). 
      Some conditions may favor the use of research in policymaking, like sustained 
      interactions between researchers and policymakers. Results from an exploratory 
      study on the use of health services research by Canadian provincial policymakers 
      illustrate these issues.

TI  - 'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of 
      health-care decision making.
PG  - 1825-37
AB  - There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care 
      decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and 
      expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability. There has, 
      however, been little research looking systematically at the public's preferences 
      for being involved in particular types of rationing decisions, nor indeed, has 
      there been a critical examination of the degree of involvement desired by the 
      public. The research reported here uses findings from focus groups and in-depth 
      interviews to explore these questions. Eight focus groups were conducted with a 
      total of 57 informants, four amongst randomly selected members of the public and 
      four with informants from health and non-health related organisations. Nineteen 
      interviews were conducted to allow the elaboration of focus group comments, to 
      probe views more deeply and to pursue emerging themes. The findings show 
      variations in the willingness of members of the public to be involved in health 
      care decisions and consistency across the different forms of the public as 
      represented by the focus groups with randomly selected citizens and pre-existing 
      organisations. There was a strong desire in all the groups for the public to be 
      involved both at the system and programme levels, with much less willingness to 
      be involved at the individual level. At the system and programme levels 
      informants generally favoured consultation, without responsibility for decisions, 
      but with the guarantee that their contribution would be heard and that decisions 
      taken following consultation would be explained. At the patient level informants 
      felt that the public should participate only by setting criteria for deciding 
      between potential beneficiaries of treatment. The public has much to contribute, 
      particularly at the system and programme levels, to supplement the inputs of 
      health care professionals.

TI  - The 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6 snRNA: Lsm proteins facilitate binding of Prp24 
      protein to the U6 telestem region.
PG  - 1011-33
AB  - The 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6 snRNA contain sequences that are thought to be 
      important for binding to Prp24 and Lsm proteins. By extensive mutational analysis 
      of yeast U6 snRNA, we confirmed that the 3' terminal uridine tract of U6 snRNA is 
      important for U6 binding to Lsm proteins in yeast. Binding of Prp24 protein to U6 
      RNA is dependent on or is strongly enhanced by U6 binding of Lsm proteins. This 
      supports a model for U6 snRNP assembly in which U6 RNA binds to the Lsm2-8 core 
      prior to binding Prp24 protein. Using compensatory base-pairing analysis, we show 
      that at least half of the recently identified U6 telestem as well as a nucleotide 
      sequence in the other half of the telestem are important for binding of U6 RNA to 
      Prp24 protein. Surprisingly, disruption of base pairing in the unconfirmed half 
      of the telestem enhanced U6-Prp24 binding. Truncation of the entire 3' terminal 
      domain or nearly the entire 5' terminal domain of yeast U6 allowed for detectable 
      levels of splicing to proceed in vitro. In addition to gaining knowledge of the 
      function of the 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6, our results help define the 
      minimal set of requirements for yeast U6 RNA function in splicing. We present a 
      revised secondary structural model of yeast U6 snRNA in free U6 snRNPs.

TI  - The conserved central domain of yeast U6 snRNA: importance of U2-U6 helix Ia in 
      spliceosome assembly.
PG  - 997-1010
AB  - In the pre-mRNA processing machinery of eukaryotic cells, U6 snRNA is located at 
      or near the active site for pre-mRNA splicing catalysis, and U6 is involved in 
      catalyzing the first chemical step of splicing. We have further defined the roles 
      of key features of yeast U6 snRNA in the splicing process. By assaying 
      spliceosome assembly and splicing in yeast extracts, we found that mutations of 
      yeast U6 nt 56 and 57 are similar to previously reported deletions of U2 nt 27 or 
      28, all within yeast U2-U6 helix Ia. These mutations lead to the accumulation of 
      yeast A1 spliceosomes, which form just prior to the Prp2 ATPase step and the 
      first chemical step of splicing. These results strongly suggest that, at a late 
      stage of spliceosome assembly, the presence of U2-U6 helix Ia is important for 
      promoting the first chemical step of splicing, presumably by bringing together 
      the 5' splice site region of pre-mRNA, which is base paired to U6 snRNA, and the 
      branchsite region of the intron, which is base paired to U2 snRNA, for activation 
      of the first chemical step of splicing, as previously proposed by Madhani and 
      Guthrie [Cell, 1992, 71: 803-817]. In the 3' intramolecular stem-loop of U6, 
      mutation G81C causes an allele-specific accumulation of U6 snRNP. Base pairing of 
      the U6 3' stem-loop in yeast spliceosomes does not extend as far as to include 
      the U6 sequence of U2-U6 helix Ib, in contrast to the human U6 3' stem-loop 
      structure.

TI  - Participation in health care priority-setting through the eyes of the 
      participants.
PG  - 222-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The literature on participation in priority-setting has three key 
      gaps: it focuses on techniques for obtaining public input into priority-setting 
      that are consultative mechanisms and do not involve the public directly in 
      decision-making; it focuses primarily on the public's role in priority-setting, 
      not on all potential participants; and the range of roles that various 
      participants play in a group making priority decisions has not been described. To 
      begin addressing these gaps, we interviewed individuals who participated on two 
      priority-setting committees to identify key insights from participants about 
      participation. METHODS: A qualitative study consisting of interviews with 
      decision-makers, including patients and members of the public. RESULTS: Members 
      of the public can contribute directly to important aspects of priority-setting. 
      The participants described six specific priority-setting roles: committee chair, 
      administrator, medical specialist, medical generalist, public representative and 
      patient representative. They also described the contributions of each role to 
      priority-setting. CONCLUSIONS: Using the insights from decision-makers, we have 
      described lessons related to direct involvement of members of the public and 
      patients in priority-setting, and have identified six roles and the contributions 
      of each role.

TI  - Hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal response to cholecystokinin-B receptor agonism is 
      resistant to cortisol feedback inhibition.
PG  - 169-80
AB  - Intravenous injection of the cholecystokinin (CCK)-B receptor agonist, 
      pentagastrin, produces robust, dose-dependent release of adrenocorticotropin 
      (ACTH) and cortisol, supporting the hypothesis that CCK-B agonists 
      pharmacologically activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The 
      mechanism of activation and its physiological relevance remain uncertain. 
      Preliminary data suggest that the ACTH response to pentagastrin may be 
      differentiated from the response to exogenous corticotropin releasing hormone 
      (CRH) by its relative resistance to cortisol feedback inhibition. To more 
      directly test the relationship between cortisol levels and ACTH response to 
      pentagastrin, this study examined responses to pentagastrin (a) during a peak (8 
      a.m.) and a nadir (4 p.m.) period of endogenous cortisol secretion and (b) when 
      cortisol levels were artificially reduced to low levels by administration of 
      metyrapone. ACTH responses to pentagastrin were identical in the morning and 
      afternoon, despite substantial differences in basal cortisol levels. Suppression 
      of cortisol with metyrapone had little impact on ACTH response to pentagastrin. 
      These data support the hypothesis that CCK-B receptor mediated activation of the 
      HPA axis is relatively resistant to cortisol feedback inhibition. This 
      differentiates it from CRH-mediated activation and raises the possibility that 
      CCK could contribute to acute activation of the HPA axis even in the face of 
      elevated basal cortisol levels, such as those seen in chronic stress or some 
      psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Deliberations about deliberative methods: issues in the design and evaluation of 
      public participation processes.
PG  - 239-51
AB  - A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the 
      need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision 
      makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly 
      complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has 
      weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision 
      options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which 
      all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative 
      methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic 
      theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within 
      the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are 
      deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their 
      potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the 
      literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to 
      guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the 
      health-care sector in particular.

TI  - How can research organizations more effectively transfer research knowledge to 
      decision makers?
PG  - 221-48, 171-2
AB  - Five questions--What should be transferred to decision makers? To whom should it 
      be transferred? By whom? How? With what effect?--provide an organizing framework 
      for a knowledge transfer strategy. Opportunities for improving how research 
      organizations transfer research knowledge can be found in the differences between 
      the answers suggested by our understanding of the research literature and those 
      provided by research-organization directors asked to describe what they do. In 
      Canada, these opportunities include developing actionable messages for decision 
      makers (only 30 percent of research organizations frequently or always do this), 
      developing knowledge-uptake skills in target audiences and knowledge-transfer 
      skills in research organizations (only 20 to 22 percent frequently or always do 
      this), and evaluating the impact of knowledge-transfer activities (only 8 to 12 
      percent frequently or always conduct an evaluation). Research funders can help 
      research organizations take advantage of these opportunities.

TI  - Salivary cortisol response during exposure treatment in driving phobics.
PG  - 679-87
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Extensive research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis 
      response to stress has not clarified whether that axis is activated by phobic 
      anxiety. We addressed this issue by measuring cortisol in situational phobics 
      during exposure treatment. METHODS: Salivary cortisol was measured in 11 driving 
      phobics before and during three exposure sessions involving driving on crowded 
      limited-access highways and compared with levels measured in 13 healthy controls 
      before and during two sessions of driving on the same highways. For each subject, 
      data collected in the same time period on a comparison nondriving day served as 
      an individual baseline from which cortisol response scores were calculated. 
      RESULTS: Cortisol levels of driving phobics and controls did not differ on the 
      comparison day. Phobics also had normal cortisol response scores on awakening on 
      the mornings of the exposures but these were already increased 1 hour before 
      coming to the treatment sessions. Phobics had significantly greater cortisol 
      response scores during driving exposure and during quiet sitting periods before 
      and afterward. These greater responses generally paralleled increases in 
      self-reported anxiety. At the first exposure session, effect sizes for 
      differences in cortisol response scores between the two groups were large. 
      Initial exposure to driving in the first session evoked the largest responses. 
      CONCLUSION: The data demonstrate that the HPA axis can be strongly activated by 
      exposure to, and anticipation of, a phobic situation.

TI  - Does deliberation make a difference? Results from a citizens panel study of 
      health goals priority setting.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - How to involve the public in setting health and health care priorities is a 
      constant challenge for health system decisions. Policy maker interest in 
      involving the public in increasingly complex and value-laden priority setting 
      processes has led to the use of deliberative public involvement methods designed 
      to promote discussion and debate among participants with the objective of 
      obtaining more informed and consensual views. These methods have not been 
      evaluated rigorously using controlled designs with pre- and post-test 
      measurements. We examined, using a controlled design, the effects of introducing 
      different opportunities for deliberation into a process for obtaining public 
      input into a community health goals priority setting process. Our findings 
      indicate that deliberation does make a difference to participant views. As more 
      deliberation is introduced, participant views may be more amenable to change. 
      Deliberation also offers the potential for views to become more rather than less 
      entrenched. While we are beginning to understand the difference deliberation 
      makes to participant views, we are still at an early stage in understanding the 
      process through which these differences come about and what difference 
      deliberation makes to broader outcomes such as civic competence, civic engagement 
      and health policy decisions.

TI  - What is important to continuity in home care?. Perspectives of key stakeholders.
PG  - 177-92
AB  - In Canada, home care is growing rapidly. Each province takes a somewhat different 
      approach to its delivery. Ontario uses a competitive bidding model to award 
      contracts to community agencies that bid for service delivery rights. Contracts 
      are to be awarded based on quality and price. However, the attributes thought to 
      contribute to high quality, such as continuity of care, are not clearly defined 
      and are not measured. We sought to identify factors that were important to 
      experiencing continuity of care in home care. We interviewed home care clients 
      and their caregivers, workers in the home care system (nursing and homemaking 
      service providers, case managers) and physicians whose patients use home care. 
      During in-depth interviews with these key stakeholders, they described the 
      conditions that led to continuity of care in home care. Service providers and 
      case managers were also asked about the types of clients who need a high level of 
      care continuity. Care that is experienced as running smoothly, that responds to 
      clients' needs and requires no special effort for clients to maintain, was seen 
      as having continuity. The attributes of care experienced as facilitating 
      continuity could be grouped under two dimensions of care-managing care (care 
      planning, monitoring and review; and care coordination) and direct service 
      provision (uninterrupted service delivery; consistent, appropriate knowledge and 
      skills; ongoing accurate observation; trusting relationship between service 
      provider and client/caregiver; rapport among team members; and consistent 
      timing). Different stakeholders emphasized different attributes of care as most 
      important to continuity. Clients included consistency of timing of service 
      delivery while rarely mentioning care management issues. They emphasized the 
      importance of consistent knowledge and skills in the workers and trusting 
      relationships as important to experiencing care continuity. The description of 
      attributes of continuity of home care that emerged from this study is compared to 
      definitions found in the nursing, mental health and primary care literature.

TI  - ATP requirement for Prp5p function is determined by Cus2p and the structure of U2 
      small nuclear RNA.
PG  - 13857-62
AB  - Stable addition of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to form the 
      prespliceosome is the first ATP-dependent step in splicing, and it requires the 
      DEXD/H box ATPase Prp5p. However, prespliceosome formation occurs without ATP in 
      extracts lacking the U2 snRNP protein Cus2p. Here we show that Prp5p is required 
      for the ATP-independent prespliceosome assembly that occurs in the absence of 
      Cus2p. Addition of recombinant Cus2p can restore the ATP dependence of 
      prespliceosome assembly, but only if it is added before Prp5p. Prp5p with an 
      altered ATP-binding domain (Prp5-GNTp) can support growth in vivo, but only in a 
      cus2 deletion strain, mirroring the in vitro results. Other Prp5 ATP-binding 
      domain substitutions are lethal, even in the cus2 deletion strain, but can be 
      suppressed by U2 small nuclear RNA mutations that hyperstabilize U2 stem IIa. We 
      infer that the presence of Cus2p and stem IIa-destabilized forms of U2 small 
      nuclear RNA places high demands on the ATP-driven function of Prp5p. Because 
      Prp5p is not dispensable in vitro even in the absence of ATP, we propose that the 
      core Prp5p function in bringing U2 to the branchpoint is not directly 
      ATP-dependent. The positive role of Cus2p in rescuing mutant U2 can be reconciled 
      with its antagonistic effect on Prp5 function in a model whereby Cus2p first 
      helps Prp5p to activate the U2 snRNP for prespliceosome formation but then is 
      displaced by Prp5p before or during the stabilization of U2 at the branchpoint.

TI  - The policy analysis of 'values talk': lessons from Canadian health reform.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - Despite widespread recognition of the importance of values, decision makers and 
      stakeholders in health policy appear to disagree fundamentally over what 'values' 
      essentially are. Hidden dissent about the nature of values can confuse policy 
      deliberations. This study investigates empirically the following two questions: 
      (1) what sorts of entities do Canadian health reformers typically call 'values'? 
      and; (2) how do Canadian health reformers use the idea of values in health reform 
      rhetoric? We conducted a qualitative, interpretive analysis of 36 Canadian health 
      reform documents published during the period 1990-1999. The values raised in 
      Canadian health reform rhetoric vary widely not only in topic (e.g. health 
      states, health services, equity, economic viability, etc.) but also in substance 
      (e.g. physical entities, goals, principles, attitudes, etc.). We review the 
      diversity of concepts underlying 'values talk' in health policy, and discuss 
      implications for policy analysis and future research.

TI  - Managing under managed community care: the experiences of clients, providers and 
      managers in Ontario's competitive home care sector.
PG  - 359-72
AB  - In 1996, a newly elected government in the Province of Ontario, Canada, 
      introduced a managed competition environment into the home care sector through 
      the establishment of a competitive contracting process for home care services. 
      Through 65 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between November 1999 
      and January 2001, we trace the implementation of this competitive contracting 
      policy within Ontario's newly established managed community care environment and 
      assess the effects of competitive contracting against two sets of goals: (1). 
      quality of care goals that consider continuity of care of paramount importance in 
      the provision of home care; and (2). the managed competition goal of increased 
      efficiency. In assessing the implementation of this policy against these goals, 
      we highlight the conflicts that can arise in pursuing different policy goals in 
      response to different formulations of the policy problem that underpin them. We 
      map stakeholder experiences with the competitive contracting policy onto relevant 
      contracting and managed competition literatures. When measured against the goals 
      of quality of care and efficiency, the findings presented here offer a mixed 
      review of the experiences to date with the competitive contracting process 
      introduced in Ontario's home care sector and suggest improvements for managing 
      future competitive contracting processes.

TI  - The buffering effects of active coping on the relationship between SES and 
      cortisol among African American young adults.
PG  - 85-94
AB  - Cortisol levels have consistently been related to socioeconomic status (SES). 
      Possible moderators for this relationship are coping styles that are known to 
      moderate relationships between cardiovascular factors and SES. The authors 
      examined whether coping style moderated a relationship between resting cortisol 
      levels and various measures of SES in a sample of urban, African American young 
      adults. Those scoring low on coping style had high cortisol levels if they were 
      currently students or unemployed. This effect, however, differed for men and 
      women. The authors suggest that coping style may play an adaptive role regarding 
      salivary cortisol measures in young adults when they are students or unemployed. 
      Active coping may help protect against stress among young African American 
      adults.

TI  - Effect of repeat exposure on neuroendocrine and symptom responses to 
      pentagastrin.
PG  - 189-95
AB  - The cholecystokinin (CCK-B) agonist pentagastrin stimulates dose-dependent 
      release of adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol in humans, likely via direct 
      pharmacological action at pituitary CCK-B receptors. Pentagastrin also produces 
      side effects, however, which may be experienced as novel or anxiety arousing and 
      could contribute to ACTH release. Available data suggest that pentagastrin's 
      activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is unrelated to 
      anxiety symptoms themselves, but novelty effects have not been examined in this 
      model and do strongly activate this system in animals. To further explore the 
      impact of novelty and anxiety symptoms on HPA responses, pentagastrin was 
      administered twice to 12 subjects (six male, six female) under single-blind 
      conditions. Repeat pentagastrin injection was associated with a slight 
      habituation in the magnitude of symptom and HPA axis responses, but robust HPA 
      and symptom responses were seen following both injections. No relationships were 
      found between anxiety symptoms and HPA activity and the modest symptomatic and 
      neuroendocrine habituation appeared to occur independently. Pentagastrin may 
      release ACTH and cortisol through direct pharmacological action, perhaps enhanced 
      on first exposure by psychologically mediated novelty effects. Novelty, per se, 
      is not likely the primary mediator of the HPA response. This model may be useful 
      for further study of cognitive-emotional modulators of HPA axis activity.

TI  - Canadians confront health care reform.
PG  - 186-93
AB  - In 2002 Canadians were less anxious about the state of their health care system 
      than they were a few years earlier, when perceptions peaked that the system 
      needed major reform. They expressed strong support in 2002 for maintaining the 
      status quo on health care financing (that is, no user fees and no two-tier care) 
      within the traditional domains of physician and hospital care. But they appeared 
      more receptive to two-tier care and for-profit delivery for the newer and rapidly 
      expanding domains of home care and high-tech care.

TI  - Effects of propranolol on symptom and endocrine responses to pentagastrin.
PG  - 1163-71
AB  - Intravenous injections of CCK-B agonists, such as pentagastrin, produce symptoms 
      of panic and potent activation of the human hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) 
      axis. It is unclear whether these psychological and endocrine effects are 
      mediated by similar or independent processes. Independence is supported by prior 
      evidence that beta-adrenergic receptor blockade attenuates cardiovascular and 
      symptom but not vasopressin responses to CCK-4. To further explore associations 
      between somatic, emotional and endocrine responses to CCK-B agents, and potential 
      beta-adrenergic mediating mechanisms, symptom and endocrine responses to 
      pentagastrin were examined after propranolol pre-treatment. Cardiovascular, 
      symptom, and endocrine (ACTH, cortisol, epinephrine) responses to pentagastrin 
      were measured in 16 healthy adult subjects randomly assigned to receive 
      propranolol or placebo pre-treatment. Propranolol significantly blocked the 
      normal cardiac acceleration produced by pentagastrin, but did not reduce panic 
      symptom or anxiety effects. It delayed and perhaps enhanced the cortisol 
      response. No relationship between HPA and symptom responses following 
      pentagastrin could be detected, though pre-pentagastrin cortisol was inversely 
      related to post-injection panic symptom intensity. Endocrine, cardiovascular and 
      symptom responses to pentagastrin appear to be separately mediated, as they did 
      not change in concert in response to propranolol pre-treatment, nor were they 
      correlated with one another. The results are consistent with the presence of 
      inhibitory beta-adrenergic mediation of the HPA axis in humans. They support the 
      hypothesis that the HPA response to pentagastrin is not secondary to the 
      psychological stress of its side effects.

TI  - Effect of comorbid anxiety disorders on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
      response to a social stressor in major depression.
PG  - 113-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is often complicated by anxiety 
      symptoms, and anxiety disorders occur in approximately 30% of mood cases. This 
      study examined the influence of anxiety comorbidity on the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response to stress in patients with 
      MDD. METHODS: Untreated subjects with pure MDD (n = 15), MDD with comorbid 
      anxiety disorders (n = 18), and pure anxiety disorders (n = 15) were recruited by 
      advertising. Age- and gender-matched control subjects were recruited for each 
      subject with a psychiatric diagnosis (n = 48). All subjects underwent a social 
      stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and blood was collected for 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol assay. RESULTS: When all 
      depressed patients (n = 33) were compared with their matched control subjects (n 
      = 33), they showed a significantly greater ACTH response to the stressor; 
      however, this exaggerated ACTH response was exclusively due to the depressed 
      group with comorbid anxiety disorders. A similar but nonsignificant effect was 
      observed in the cortisol response. Subjects with pure mood or pure anxiety 
      disorders showed normal ACTH and cortisol responses to the TSST. All patient 
      groups showed similar levels of TSST-induced anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid 
      anxiety disorders might play a role in the increased activation of the HPA axis 
      observed in patients with major depression.

TI  - New tertiary constraints between the RNA components of active yeast spliceosomes: 
      a photo-crosslinking study.
PG  - 1251-65
AB  - Elucidation of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the two sequential active 
      sites in spliceosomes is essential for understanding the mechanism of 
      premessenger RNA splicing. The mechanism is predicted to be catalyzed by the 
      small nuclear RNA (snRNA) components of spliceosomes. To obtain new tertiary 
      constraints between the RNA components, we produced and mapped crosslinks between 
      U6 snRNA and the proximal RNAs of active yeast spliceosomes ("yeast" in this 
      report is Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thus, specific sites in U6, when substituted 
      with a photoreactive 4-thiouridine or 5-iodouridine, produced 
      spliceosome-dependent crosslinks to U2 snRNA, or in one case, to the pre-mRNA 
      substrate. One set of U2-U6 crosslinks formed before the Prp2p-dependent step of 
      spliceosome assembly, whereas another set formed during or after this step but 
      before the first chemical step of splicing. This latter set of crosslinks formed 
      across U2-U6 helix I. Importantly, this set provides new tertiary constraints for 
      developing 3D models of fully assembled yeast spliceosomes, which are poised for 
      the first chemical step of splicing.

TI  - Clinical calibration of DSM-IV diagnoses in the World Mental Health (WMH) version 
      of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic 
      Interview (WMHCIDI).
PG  - 122-39
AB  - An overview is presented of the rationale, design, and analysis plan for the 
      WMH-CIDI clinical calibration studies. As no clinical gold standard assessment is 
      available for the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the WMH-CIDI, we adopted the goal 
      of calibration rather than validation; that is, we asked whether WMH-CIDI 
      diagnoses are 'consistent' with diagnoses based on a state-of-the-art clinical 
      research diagnostic interview (SCID; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) 
      rather than whether they are 'correct'. Consistency is evaluated both at the 
      aggregate level (consistency of WMH-CIDI and SCID prevalence estimates) and at 
      the individual level (consistency of WMH-CIDI and SCID diagnostic 
      classifications). Although conventional statistics (sensitivity, specificity, 
      Cohen's kappa) are used to describe diagnostic consistency, an argument is made 
      for considering the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) to be a more 
      useful general-purpose measure of consistency. In addition, more detailed 
      analyses are used to evaluate consistency on a substantive level. These analyses 
      begin by estimating prediction equations in a clinical calibration subsample, 
      with WMH-CIDI symptom-level data used to predict SCID diagnoses, and using the 
      coefficients from these equations to assign predicted probabilities of SCID 
      diagnoses to each respondent in the remainder of the sample. Substantive analyses 
      then investigate whether estimates of prevalence and associations when based on 
      WMH-CIDI diagnoses are consistent with those based on predicted SCID diagnoses. 
      Multiple imputation is used to adjust estimated standard errors for the 
      imprecision introduced by SCID diagnoses being imputed under a model rather than 
      measured directly. A brief illustration of this approach is presented in 
      comparing the precision of SCID and predicted SCID estimates of prevalence and 
      correlates under varying sample designs.

TI  - Twenty-four hour growth hormone secretion in patients with panic disorder.
PG  - 72-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with panic disorder have blunted growth hormone (GH) 
      responses to clonidine, suggesting subsensitivity of post-synaptic 
      alpha(2)-adrenoreceptors, presumably in response to excessive central 
      noradrenergic outflow. However, basal levels of GH release over a full circadian 
      cycle have not been examined in panic. Reduced basal GH release would suggest an 
      overall hypo-active GH system rather than a specific alpha-adrenergic 
      abnormality. METHODS: To determine whether panic patients show reduced basal GH 
      secretion, 20 patients and 12 healthy controls were studied. Blood samples were 
      drawn every 15 min for 24 h and plasma was assayed for GH. Patients were 
      restudied during successful treatment with alprazolam. Groups were compared on 
      overnight and daytime GH secretion and circadian patterns of release. RESULTS: 
      Patients showed normal levels on all measures of GH release. Treatment may have 
      reduced nocturnal GH release slightly, but treated patients still did not differ 
      from controls. The normal predominance of sleep over waking GH secretion was seen 
      in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Panic patients, in contrast to depressed patients, 
      have normal somatotrophic axis activity when measured in a resting state over a 
      full circadian cycle. GH dysregulation may only be evident in these patients in 
      activation paradigms and has been most consistently demonstrated by challenges 
      with the alpha(2)-noradrenergic agonist, clonidine.

TI  - Will it make a difference if I show up and share? A citizens' perspective on 
      improving public involvement processes for health system decision-making.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health policy decision-makers are grappling with increasingly 
      complex and ethically controversial decisions at a time when citizens are 
      demanding more involvement in these decision processes. OBJECTIVES: To assess and 
      revise a set of guiding principles for the design of public involvement processes 
      generated from a synthesis of public participation design and evaluation 
      frameworks that can be used to inform the design and evaluation of future public 
      participation processes in the health sector. METHODS: Six focus groups held in 
      five Canadian provinces comprising citizens with considerable experience of 
      public participation processes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that 
      citizen participants are highly critical of, and discerning about,their public 
      participation experiences. Yet, they are optimistic and determined to contribute 
      in meaningful ways to future public policy processes. They are clear about where 
      improvements are needed and give top priority to what information is shared, and 
      how, among participants and decision-makers. The views of experienced citizens 
      mapped well onto most of the prior principles of public involvement with a few 
      modifications. First, participants gave greater emphasis to the content and 
      balance of information for the purposes of building trust and credibility between 
      citizens and decision-makers. Second, participants viewed themselves, as well as 
      decision-makers, as sources of information to be shared through the consultation 
      process. Finally, participants stressed the importance of getting the information 
      and communication principles right over addressing all other principles.

TI  - Cortisol pulsatility and its role in stress regulation and health.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - One of the classic characteristics of the human stress response is the wide 
      inter-individual variation. Although there is much current interest in the 
      genetic and environmental contributions to these differences, studies on human 
      subject have been sparse and characterised by methodological problems. The major 
      factor that is rarely taken into account is the intrinsic rhythmicity of 
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity, not simply the classic diurnal variation 
      but also the endogenous pulsatility which is similar to, but much less well 
      recognized than, the rhythms found within the reproductive and growth hormone 
      axes. In this review we propose some novel ideas relating to the importance of 
      pulsatility both for the design of human stress-response studies and for their 
      interpretation as well as implications for our understanding of disease.

TI  - Anxious and depressive disorders and their comorbidity: effect on central nervous 
      system noradrenergic function.
PG  - 875-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although comorbidity of anxiety with depression is common, 
      investigations of physiologic abnormalities related specifically to comorbidity 
      are rare. This study examined relationships of DSM-IV-defined depression, 
      anxiety, and their comorbidity to noradrenergic function measured by blunting of 
      the growth hormone (GH) response to the alpha2 adrenoreceptor agonist (and 
      imidazoline receptor agent) clonidine and by blood pressure and symptom 
      responses. METHODS: Fifteen subjects with pure social anxiety or panic disorder, 
      15 with pure major depression, and 18 with both depression and anxiety were 
      compared with healthy control subjects matched for age and gender. Other factors 
      known to affect GH (weight, menstrual status, prior antidepressant, or other drug 
      exposure) were controlled. RESULTS: Anxiety produced GH blunting, but depression 
      was associated with normal GH responses. The comorbid state did not affect 
      results beyond the impact of anxiety. Preclonidine stress-related GH elevations 
      were observed, to the greatest degree in anxious subjects. Relevant symptom, but 
      not blood pressure, changes were significantly associated with blunting. 
      CONCLUSIONS: With use of pure depression and anxiety groups and careful control 
      of other factors known to affect GH, these results demonstrate central nervous 
      system noradrenergic dysfunction in anxiety disorders. In contrast to less 
      rigorously controlled studies, noradrenergic function in depression was normal.

TI  - Family Perceptions of End-of-Life Care in long-term care facilities.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - The study examined the utility of the Family Perception of Care Scale (FPCS), 
      which consists of four subscales: resident care, family support, communication, 
      and rooming. This instrument was developed for the purposes of this study. 
      Overall, family members were satisfied with end-of-life care. Satisfaction did 
      not have a statistically significant relationship to family and resident 
      characteristics. Survey questions with the highest number of low satisfaction 
      ratings included staffing levels, updating families and involving them in care 
      planning, and decision making. Family members considered pain control an 
      important priority, followed by comfort care that included caring for a family 
      member with dignity and sensitivity. Family members also valued it when staff 
      were able to inform them that the death of their family member was near. Place of 
      death was significantly associated with satisfaction, family members being more 
      satisfied with end-of-life care when their family member died in the LTC facility 
      as opposed to in hospital.

TI  - Error-related hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex in 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 287-94
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperactivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in patients with 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) has been shown to increase with symptom 
      provocation and to normalize with treatment-induced symptom reduction. Although 
      the functional significance of anterior cingulate involvement in OCD remains 
      unknown, electrophysiological evidence has linked this region to error-processing 
      abnormalities in patients with OCD. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      (fMRI) study, we sought to further localize error-processing differences within 
      the ACC of OCD patients compared with healthy subjects. METHODS: Event-related 
      fMRI data were collected for eight OCD patients and seven healthy subjects during 
      the performance of a simple cognitive task designed to elicit errors but not OCD 
      symptoms. RESULTS: Both OCD patients and healthy subjects demonstrated dorsal ACC 
      activation during error commission. The OCD patients exhibited significantly 
      greater error-related activation of the rostral ACC than comparison subjects. 
      Activity in this region was positively correlated with symptom severity in the 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Error-processing abnormalities within the rostral anterior 
      cingulate occur in the absence of symptom expression in patients with OCD.

TI  - Deep brain stimulation for refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 510-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurosurgery (anterior capsulotomy) has been beneficial to many 
      patients with debilitating, refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), but 
      the irreversibility of the procedure is an important limitation to its use. 
      Nondestructive, electrical stimulation (deep brain stimulation; DBS) has proven 
      an effective alternative to ablative surgery for neurological indications, 
      suggesting potential utility in place of capsulotomy for OCD. METHODS: The 
      effects of DBS for OCD were examined in four patients in a short-term, blinded, 
      on-off design and long-term, open follow-up. The patients had incapacitating 
      illness, refractory to standard treatments. Hardware developed for movement 
      disorder treatment was surgically implanted, with leads placed bilaterally in the 
      anterior limbs of their internal capsules. Patients received stimulation in a 
      randomized "on-off" sequence of four 3-week blocks. Ongoing, open stimulation was 
      continued in consenting patients after the controlled trial. RESULTS: Patients 
      tolerated DBS well. Dramatic benefits to mood, anxiety, and OCD symptoms were 
      seen in one patient during blinded study and open, long-term follow-up. A second 
      patient showed moderate benefit during open follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: It appears 
      that DBS has potential value for treating refractory psychiatric disorders, but 
      additional development work is needed before the procedure is utilized outside of 
      carefully controlled research protocols.

TI  - Invasive fungal infections in pediatric oncology patients: 11-year experience at 
      a single institution.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of fungal infections in 
      pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) patients and to describe variations 
      regarding site of infection, organisms, and mortality. The records of 1,052 
      patients presenting to the UCLA PHO service with various malignancies from 1991 
      to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. No patient received invasive antifungal 
      prophylaxis. Transplant patients were excluded. The 11-year incidence of fungal 
      infections in this pediatric oncology cohort was 4.9%. There was a linear 
      increase in the incidence of fungal infections from 2.9% to 7.8% between 1996 and 
      2001 (P = 0.001). Patients with acute leukemia represented 36% of the population 
      but had a disproportionate incidence (67%) of fungal infections. Adolescents had 
      twice the expected incidence of infection (P < 0.0001). Overall, Candida sp. was 
      the major pathogen. Over time, a trend of fewer infections caused by Candida and 
      more due to Aspergillus was noted. Blood-borne infections decreased over time, 
      while those in the urinary and respiratory tracts increased (P = 0.04). Sixty-two 
      percent of infections occurred in neutropenic patients. PHO patients had an 
      overall mortality of 21%, but those with fungal infections experienced a 2.6-fold 
      higher mortality that was not attributable to infections alone. Empiric 
      antifungal therapy had no effect on mortality rates. Concurrent nonfungal 
      infections did not increase mortality rates. The incidence of fungal infections 
      increased over time, possibly as a result of advances in antibacterial and 
      chemotherapeutic regimens. Adolescents and patients with leukemia were especially 
      at risk. Fungal infections are a poor prognostic factor, independent of 
      fungal-related mortality. New diagnostic methods allowing for early detection and 
      treatment as well as more effective therapies are needed.

TI  - Interaction of brain noradrenergic system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
      (HPA) axis in man.
PG  - 807-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous interactions between the brainstem locus coeruleus system 
      and the HPA axis have been shown in experimental animals. This relationship is 
      less well characterized in humans and little is known about the influence of 
      psychiatric disorders, which disturb one of these systems, on this relationship. 
      METHODS: Untreated subjects with pure MDD (n = 13), MDD with comorbid anxiety 
      disorders (n = 17), and pure anxiety disorders (n = 15) were recruited by 
      advertising. Age and sex matched control subjects were recruited for each subject 
      with a psychiatric diagnosis (n = 45). All subjects underwent a social stressor, 
      the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), and blood was collected for ACTH assay. 
      These same subjects also underwent a clonidine challenge study for assessment of 
      growth hormone release as a marker of tonic noradrenergic activation. RESULTS: 
      Examining log transformed area under the curve response for each hormone, a 
      significant negative relationship (simple regression) was observed between 
      systems in normal subjects. This relationship was preserved in anxiety subjects. 
      However, both pure depressed and comorbid depressed and anxiety subjects 
      demonstrated disruption of this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: Under normal 
      circumstances, noradrenergic systems can influence the magnitude of the HPA axis 
      response to stress. However, in subjects with major depression, HPA axis 
      activation appears autonomous of noradrenergic influence.

TI  - Cognitive modulation of the endocrine stress response to a pharmacological 
      challenge in normal and panic disorder subjects.
PG  - 668-75
AB  - CONTEXT: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may mediate the 
      deleterious effects of stress on health. It is sensitive to cognitive and 
      emotional aspects of organism-environment interactions, such as familiarity, 
      control, and social support. Scientific study of how such factors moderate human 
      HPA axis activity has been limited. Their relevance to HPA axis disturbances in 
      psychiatric patients is largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether 
      cognitive manipulation can alter HPA axis activity in laboratory studies and 
      whether patients with panic disorder are differentially sensitive to the 
      manipulated factors. DESIGN: Pharmacological activation paradigm 
      (cholecystokinin-B agonist pentagastrin) by which we examined symptom and 
      endocrine effects on subjects randomly assigned to a standard introduction or a 
      cognitive intervention. SETTING: Clinical research center. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Recruited from university clinic and newspaper advertisements. Fourteen patients 
      with panic disorder and 14 controls, individually matched for age and sex. 
      Intervention Half of each group received a 9-minute cognitive intervention 
      designed to reduce novelty, increase cognitive coping, and provide a sense of 
      control. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol levels. 
      RESULTS: The cognitive intervention significantly reduced cortisol (P = .02) and 
      ACTH (P = .01) levels, despite pentagastrin's robust stimulation of both hormones 
      (P<.001). The intervention effect was evident in patients and controls, who did 
      not differ in basal HPA axis activity or response to pentagastrin. They did 
      differ in panic symptom responses, which were unaffected by the intervention, and 
      in ACTH effects of the intervention. Patients' exaggerated anxiety responses to 
      pentagastrin were normalized by the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Cognitive/emotional manipulation can substantially modulate HPA axis responses to 
      pharmacological activation in humans, and HPA disturbances in panic disorder may 
      be secondary to manipulable cognitive/emotional sensitivities. Further study of 
      such factors as novelty, control, and coping may help clarify the origins of HPA 
      axis disturbance in psychiatric disorders and the mediators linking psychosocial 
      stress to disease.

TI  - Frequency of fungemia in hospitalized pediatric inpatients over 11 years at a 
      tertiary care institution.
PG  - 61-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of bloodstream fungal infections in 
      children who were admitted to our tertiary institution over an 11-year period. 
      METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients who were aged 0 to 
      21 years, had bloodstream fungal infections, and were admitted to the University 
      of California, Los Angeles from 1991 through 2001. Patients were identified 
      through the microbiology laboratory database. All positive fungal cultures for 
      pediatric inpatients were reviewed. For each fungemic patient, a review of 
      clinical course, cause, and outcome was performed. RESULTS: Over 11 years, 1124 
      pediatric inpatients with 3633 positive cultures had evidence of fungal 
      colonization or infection. The mean incidence of positive fungal cultures 
      increased from 105 between 1991 and 1996 to 129 patients per year between 1997 
      and 2001. Fungal isolates were mainly Candida species (85%) obtained primarily 
      from respiratory (41%) and urine (27%) cultures. Only 7.5% of positive fungal 
      cultures were from blood, although 24490 pediatric admissions prompted 72960 
      bacterial and fungal blood cultures, at charges of 2.52 million dollars. Of 14592 
      fungal blood cultures, <2% (n = 272) were positive, involving <1% (n = 97) of 
      patients. The mean rise in number of children with fungemia was significant, from 
      6.8 between 1991 and 1996 to 13.0 patients per year between 1997 and 2001. 
      Fungemia was associated with a high all-cause mortality rate (46%), particularly 
      in immunocompromised patients (57%). Organisms recovered were primarily Candida 
      species (91%). There was a decline in C albicans and C glabrata fungemia and an 
      increase in C parapsilosis organisms. In 84% of patients, fungal organisms were 
      isolated from both bacterial and fungal blood cultures, and in 74%, the same 
      organism was isolated from additional body sites. CONCLUSIONS: Episodes of 
      fungemia increased significantly over 11 years as compared with a moderate 
      increase in positive fungal cultures and were associated with high all-cause 
      mortality rates. More sensitive assays for early identification of fungal 
      bloodstream infections are warranted.

TI  - Research use in children's mental health policy in Canada: maintaining vigilance 
      amid ambiguity.
PG  - 1649-57
AB  - Many researchers hope to see the best available research evidence used in 
      policy-making to address important public problems. However, policy often appears 
      to be based on anything but the research evidence, as the problem of conduct 
      disorder (or severe antisocial behaviour in children) shows. In Canada, few 
      children receive effective prevention or treatment programs, and incarceration is 
      overused, despite evidence that it is ineffective and potentially harmful. Using 
      the example of conduct disorder, we investigated why policy-making has not 
      reflected the research evidence, examining research use in the context of 
      competing influences on the policy process. Qualitative methods were used to 
      analyze data from interviews with thirty-two politicians and senior civil 
      servants. Our allegiance to rationality wavered as we listened to policy-makers 
      who contended with the inherent ambiguity in the policy process. They told us 
      that they managed institutional constraints including fragmentation across levels 
      and sectors of government, and the long-term effects of fiscal restraint. They 
      also reconciled the competing interests of stakeholders' priorities, the public's 
      response to negative events involving children and the media's role in shaping 
      this response. Ideas about youth violence were morally charged, but policy-makers 
      remained committed to improving children's lives. Day-to-day, policy-makers 
      obtained most of their information internally and informally. Research evidence 
      was valued and used, but as just one source of ideas and information among many. 
      In this environment of ambiguity, creative civil servants formed partnerships 
      with trusted researchers in order to change policy. Our findings suggest that the 
      use of research evidence in policy-making could be enhanced if researchers 
      learned about the competing influences on the policy process, formed 
      research-policy partnerships, challenged the incentives within research 
      institutions, and engaged in public debates about important problems, such as 
      child antisocial behaviour.

TI  - From rhetoric to reality: including patient voices in supportive cancer care 
      planning.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the extent and manner of patient participation in the 
      planning of regional supportive care networks throughout the province of Ontario. 
      We consider the disconnect between the rhetoric and reality of patient 
      involvement in network planning and co-ordination. CONTEXT: In 1997, the Province 
      of Ontario, Canada, established a new, regionalized cancer care system. By 
      transferring responsibility to the regional level and to networks, the architects 
      of the new provincial system hoped to broaden participation in decision making 
      and to enhance the responsiveness of decisions to communities. RESEARCH APPROACH: 
      Through a qualitative, multiple case study approach we evaluated the processes of 
      involving patients in network development. In-depth, semi-structured interviews 
      and document analysis were complemented by observations of provincial meetings, 
      regional council and network meetings. RESULTS: The network development processes 
      in the three case study regions reveal a significant gap between intentions to 
      involve patients in health planning and their actual involvement. This gap can be 
      explained by: (i) a lack of clear direction regarding networks and patient 
      participation in these networks; (ii) the dominance of regional cancer centres in 
      network planning activities; and, (iii) the emergence of competing provincial 
      priorities. DISCUSSION: These three trends expose the complexity of the notion of 
      public participation and how it is embedded in social and political contexts. The 
      failed attempt at involving patients in health planning efforts is the result of 
      benign neglect of public participation intents and the social and political 
      contexts in which public and patient participation is meant to occur.

TI  - The development of persistent pain and psychological morbidity after motor 
      vehicle collision: integrating the potential role of stress response systems into 
      a biopsychosocial model.
PG  - 783-90
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Persistent pain and psychological sequelae are common after motor 
      vehicle collision (MVC), but their etiology remains poorly understood. Such 
      common sequelae include whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), fibromyalgia, and 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Increasing evidence suggests that these 
      disorders share overlapping epidemiologic and clinical features. A model is 
      proposed in which central neurobiological systems, including physiologic systems 
      and neuroanatomical structures involved in the stress response, are an important 
      substrate for the development of all 3 disorders and interact with psychosocial 
      and other factors to influence chronic symptom development. METHODS: 
      Epidemiologic and clinical characteristics regarding the development of these 
      disorders after MVC are reviewed. Evidence suggesting a role for stress response 
      systems in the development of these disorders is presented. RESULTS: Contemporary 
      evidence supports a model of chronic symptom development that incorporates the 
      potential for interactions between past experience, acute stress responses to 
      trauma, post-MVC behavior, and cognitive/psychosocial consequences to alter 
      activity within brain regions which process pain and to result in persistent 
      pain, as well as psychological sequelae, after MVC. Such a model incorporates 
      factors identified in prior biopsychosocial theories and places them in the 
      landscape of our rapidly developing understanding of stress systems and CNS 
      pain-modulating pathways. CONCLUSION: New models are needed to stimulate deeper 
      examination of the interacting influences of initial tissue damage, acute pain, 
      psychosocial contingencies, and central stress pathways during chronic symptom 
      development after MVC. Deeper understanding could contribute to improved 
      treatment approaches to reduce the immense personal and societal burdens of 
      common trauma-related disorders.

TI  - Sequence variants in SLITRK1 are associated with Tourette's syndrome.
PG  - 317-20
AB  - Tourette's syndrome (TS) is a genetically influenced developmental 
      neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by chronic vocal and motor tics. We 
      studied Slit and Trk-like 1 (SLITRK1) as a candidate gene on chromosome 13q31.1 
      because of its proximity to a de novo chromosomal inversion in a child with TS. 
      Among 174 unrelated probands, we identified a frameshift mutation and two 
      independent occurrences of the identical variant in the binding site for microRNA 
      hsa-miR-189. These variants were absent from 3600 control chromosomes. SLITRK1 
      mRNA and hsa-miR-189 showed an overlapping expression pattern in brain regions 
      previously implicated in TS. Wild-type SLITRK1, but not the frameshift mutant, 
      enhanced dendritic growth in primary neuronal cultures. Collectively, these 
      findings support the association of rare SLITRK1 sequence variants with TS.

TI  - Videoconferencing-based cognitive-behavioral therapy for obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder.
PG  - 1821-9
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent, chronic and disabling anxiety 
      disorder. Despite the efficacy and strength of pharmacologic interventions for 
      OCD, medications are not always well accepted or effective, making an efficacious 
      psychosocial alternative especially attractive. Cognitive-behavioral therapy 
      (CBT) has been established as an effective treatment for adult OCD, yet access to 
      such treatment is limited, especially in rural areas. Technological advances 
      allow for therapy to be provided in a real-time format over a videoconferencing 
      network. This method allows therapists to provide state-of-the-art treatment to 
      patients who would not otherwise have access to it. This paper presents three 
      cases of OCD successfully treated via videoconferencing CBT. The presence of OCD 
      was established via structured clinical interview and clinician-rated outcome 
      measures were completed by evaluators blinded to the method of treatment. A 
      multiple baseline across individuals design was used to support the internal 
      validity of the CBT outcome data. Patient ratings of therapeutic alliance were 
      high across all three cases. Information gathered from qualitative interviews 
      post-treatment confirmed quantitative measures finding high levels of patient 
      satisfaction. This pilot study suggests that videoconferencing-based CBT is a 
      promising method to bring appropriate treatment to thousands who live far 
      distances from well-trained therapists.

TI  - Are we expecting too much from print media? An analysis of newspaper coverage of 
      the 2002 Canadian healthcare reform debate.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - News media effects on their audiences are complex. Four commonly cited effects 
      are: informing audiences; agenda-setting; framing; and persuading. The release in 
      autumn 2002 of two reports on options for reforming Canada's healthcare system 
      attracted widespread media attention. We explored the potential for each of the 
      four media effects by examining Canadian newspaper representation of this 
      healthcare policy debate. Clippings were gathered from regional and national 
      newspapers. Two data collection methodologies were employed: the first involved 
      two staggered "constructed weeks" designed to capture thematic news framing 
      styles; the second collected "intensive" or episodic coverage immediately 
      following the report releases. Health reform articles with a financing and/or 
      delivery focus were included. Using a codebook, articles were coded to track 
      article characteristics, tone, healthcare sector and reform themes, and key 
      actors. A greater quantity of episodic (n=341 clippings) versus thematic coverage 
      (n=77) was documented. Coverage type did not vary significantly by newspaper, 
      reporting source (e.g., staff reporter versus staff editorialist) or article type 
      (e.g., news versus letter). Thematic articles were significantly shorter in 
      length compared to episodic clippings. Episodic coverage tended to have a 
      positive tone, while thematic coverage ranged in tone. Most coverage was general 
      in scope. Sector-specific coverage favoured physician and hospital care--the two 
      providers accorded privileged financing arrangements under Canada's universal, 
      provincially administered health-insurance plans. Coverage of healthcare 
      financing arrangements favoured broad discussions of publicly financed 
      healthcare, federal-provincial governmental relations, and the Canada Health Act 
      that governs provincial plans. Governmental actors and the political institutions 
      that they represent were the dominant actors. Professional associations were also 
      visible, but played a less dominant role. Given its non-specific scope, it is 
      unclear how informative this coverage was. The large quantity and short duration 
      of the episodic coverage, and the preponderance of governmental actors, suggests 
      these newspapers acted as conduits for the policy agenda. Differences in framing 
      styles were observed by coverage type, newspaper, reporting source, article 
      length and type of article. Finally, the dominance of governmental actors 
      provided these actors with numerous opportunities to persuade the public.

TI  - Some characteristics of early-onset injection drug users prior to and at the time 
      of their first injection.
PG  - 548-55
AB  - AIMS: This paper examines differences between early- and late-onset injection 
      drug users (12-16 years versus 17-24 years) in terms of the antecedents and 
      circumstances of first injection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective design, 
      using logistic regression. Setting Australia: Sydney, Brisbane, rural New South 
      Wales. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 336 injection drug users aged 16-25 years at the 
      time of interview. MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables included family injection 
      drug use, homelessness and other demographic variables, drugs used prior to the 
      first injection, length of pre-injection drug career, behaviours at time of first 
      injection (e.g. drug injected, reasons/motives for the first injection, risk 
      behaviours). FINDINGS: Early-onset injection was associated independently with: 
      having a family who injected drugs, having left school early, an unreliable 
      source of income, a short pre-injection drug career, planning of the first 
      injection, reliance on others for administration of the first injection and 
      denial that experimentation was the motive for the first injection. In bivariate 
      analysis, early-onset injection was associated further with: homelessness, being 
      an Indigenous Australian, omission of use of certain pre-injection drugs, group 
      presence at first injection, reliance on others for acquisition of the first 
      needle and syringe and having injected the first time because an injection was 
      offered. CONCLUSIONS: The research shows that early-onset, compared with 
      late-onset injectors, are more likely to have an immediate family who inject 
      drugs and other problematic beginnings in early life. They have an accelerated 
      transition to injection, and differences in autonomy and motivation at first 
      injection. These characteristics may make them more vulnerable to risk taking.

TI  - Medial frontal cortex activity and loss-related responses to errors.
PG  - 4063-70
AB  - Making an error elicits activity from brain regions that monitor performance, 
      especially the medial frontal cortex (MFC). However, uncertainty exists about 
      whether the posterior or anterior/rostral MFC processes errors and to what degree 
      affective responses to errors are mediated in the MFC, specifically the rostral 
      anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). To test the hypothesis that rACC mediates a 
      type of affective response, we conceptualized affect in response to an error as a 
      reaction to loss and amplified this response with a monetary penalty. While 
      subjects performed a cognitive interference task during functional magnetic 
      resonance imaging, hemodynamic activity in the rACC was significantly greater 
      when subjects lost money as a result of an error compared with errors that did 
      not lead to monetary loss. A significant interaction between the incentive 
      conditions and error events demonstrated that the effect was not merely 
      attributable to working harder to win (or not lose) money, although an effect of 
      motivation was noted in the mid-MFC. Activation foci also occurred in similar 
      regions of the posterior MFC for error and interference processing, which were 
      not modulated by the incentive conditions. However, at the level of the 
      individual subject, substantial functional variability occurred along the MFC 
      during error processing, including foci in the rostral/anterior extent of the MFC 
      not appearing in the group analysis. The findings support the hypothesis that the 
      rostral extent of the MFC (rACC) processes loss-related responses to errors, and 
      individual differences may account for some of the reported variation of 
      error-related foci in the MFC.

TI  - Knowledge into action? understanding ideological barriers to addressing health 
      inequalities at the local level.
PG  - 158-71
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the presence of ideological barriers 
      to addressing local health inequalities in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A survey of 
      active citizens revealed low levels of awareness of the social determinants of 
      health (SDOH) framework, and some incongruence between understanding and 
      attitudes towards the SDOH. Support for addressing health inequalities was 
      associated with awareness of the SDOH framework, liberal value-systems, and a 
      cluster of socio-demographic characteristics. Liberal leaning participants were 
      also more politically active than their conservative counterparts. Ideological 
      barriers included lack of SDOH awareness, narrow understandings of the relative 
      influences of the SDOH, resistance to de-prioritizing healthcare, and 
      conservative values. Advancement of a SDOH policy agenda should incorporate wider 
      dissemination efforts to citizens and local service providers to increase support 
      for this framework, and utilization of existing support and political engagement 
      from liberal-leaning demographics.

TI  - Increased psychiatric morbidity after abdominal aortic surgery: risk factors for 
      stress-related disorders.
PG  - 929-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Research on surgical outcomes has focused on technical results and 
      physical morbidity. However, postoperative psychiatric complications are common 
      and can undermine functional results. High rates of posttraumatic stress disorder 
      and major depressive disorder have been documented after cardiac events or 
      surgery. These complications are also expected after abdominal aortic surgery, 
      but their incidence and relevant risk factors in this population have not been 
      documented. METHODS: We examined the development of posttraumatic stress and 
      depressive symptoms in patients with aortic aneurysms or occlusive disease, 
      comparing surgical with nonsurgical patients and predicting that surgery and a 
      prolonged intensive care stay would contribute to the development of psychiatric 
      morbidity. A consecutive sample of vascular surgery patients (n = 109) was 
      recruited 6 months to 2 years after surgery. Data were analyzed by using group 
      comparisons, regression, and path analyses. RESULTS: Rates of objectively 
      determined postoperative psychiatric morbidity were extremely high (32%). 
      Surgical patients were more than four times more likely to develop psychiatric 
      disorders (odds ratio, 4.8; P = .02). Being younger, having increased 
      preoperative blood pressure, and being intubated at the end of surgery were 
      linked to greater rates of psychiatric morbidity (P < .05), but a longer 
      intensive care stay was not. CONCLUSIONS: New-onset psychiatric symptoms are 
      common after abdominal aortic surgery, and preoperative and surgical factors were 
      more predictive than postoperative complications and stress, as reflected in 
      intensive care unit stays. Prospective examination of vulnerability in this model 
      could identify risk factors for stress-related psychiatric morbidity and help 
      improve surgical outcomes.

      produced inconsistent results. Seeking to understand the inconsistencies, we 
      reexamined endocrine data from four studies of patients with panic disorder, in 
      light of animal data highlighting the salience of novelty, control, and social 
      support to HPA axis activity. Patients with panic disorder were studied (1) at 
      rest over a full circadian cycle, (2) before and after activation by a 
      panicogenic respiratory stimulant (doxapram) that does not directly stimulate the 
      HPA axis, and (3) before and after a cholecystokinin B (CCK-B) agonist that is 
      panicogenic and does directly stimulate the HPA axis. Patients with panic 
      disorder had elevated overnight cortisol levels, which correlated with sleep 
      disruption. ACTH and cortisol levels were higher in a challenge paradigm 
      (doxapram) than in a resting state study, and paradigm-related ACTH secretion was 
      exaggerated in patients with panic disorder. Panic itself could be elicited 
      without HPA axis activation. Patients with panic disorder showed an exaggerated 
      ACTH response to pentagastrin stimulation, but this response was normalized by 
      prior exposure to the experimental context or psychological preparation to reduce 
      novelty and enhance sense of control. Novelty is one of a number of contextual 
      cues known from animal work to activate the HPA axis. The HPA axis abnormalities 
      seen in patients with panic disorder in the four experiments reviewed here might 
      all be due to exaggerated HPA axis reactivity to novelty cues. Most of the 
      published panic/HPA literature is consistent with the hypothesis that HPA axis 
      dysregulation in panic is due to hypersensitivity to contextual cues. This 
      hypothesis requires experimental testing.

TI  - Factors associated with 'feeling suicidal': the role of sexual identity.
PG  - 59-80
AB  - This paper examines factors associated with feeling suicidal in a large sample of 
      urban men in Sydney and Melbourne, aged 18-50, including heterosexual, gay and 
      bisexual men, HIV antibody positive and HIV antibody negative. As in previous 
      research, sexuality (being homosexual or bisexual) was found to be a major 
      predictor of suicidality. The research went some way towards explaining the close 
      relationship between feeling suicidal and sexual orientation. Sexuality interacts 
      with feeling bad in that, once men feel moderately bad/depressed, they are more 
      likely to feel suicidal if they are homosexual or bisexual than if they are 
      heterosexual. In addition, the research found that experience of verbal abuse and 
      physical assault (harassment) increased feeling suicidal for both heterosexual 
      and gay/bisexual men, not just for homosexual men as suggested by previous 
      research, and that social isolation in the form of living alone is a further risk 
      factor. Seeking counseling help and taking sexual risks were also independently 
      associated with feeling suicidal. These actions may result from feeling suicidal 
      rather than the reverse, and their association with feeling suicidal warrants 
      further research. Many of the 46 independent variables examined in the research, 
      including HIV antibody status and closeness to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, were 
      related to feeling suicidal only through their association with being 
      gay/bisexual. Celibacy and general risk taking were not related to feeling 
      suicidal in this study.

TI  - Bringing 'the public' into health technology assessment and coverage policy 
      decisions: from principles to practice.
PG  - 37-50
AB  - Those making health care coverage decisions rely on health technology assessment 
      (HTA) for crucial technical information. But coverage decision-making, and the 
      HTA that informs it, are also inherently political. They involve the values and 
      judgments of a range of stakeholders as well as the public. Moreover, governments 
      are politically accountable for their resource allocation decisions. Canadian 
      policy makers are at an early stage in the design of legitimate mechanisms for 
      the public to contribute to, and to be apprised of, HTA and coverage decisions. 
      As they consider the options, questions arise about whom to involve (e.g., which 
      publics), how to engage them (e.g., through what public involvement or 
      accountability mechanisms), and for what purpose (e.g., to inform the public of 
      decisions and their rationales, or to have the public directly affect those 
      decisions). Often key concepts, such as the difference between public 
      accountability and public participation, are not well articulated or 
      distinguished in these debates. Guidance is needed regarding both rationales and 
      methods for involving the public in HTA and technology coverage decisions. We 
      offer a framework that clearly distinguishes specific roles for the public, and 
      relates them to several layers of policy analysis and policy making where 'the 
      public' may engage in different tasks. The framework offers a menu of choices for 
      policy makers contemplating changes to public involvement, as well as a model 
      that can be used to characterize and analyze different approaches across 
      jurisdictions.

TI  - Prevalence and distribution of major depressive disorder in African Americans, 
      Caribbean blacks, and non-Hispanic whites: results from the National Survey of 
      American Life.
PG  - 305-15
AB  - CONTEXT: Little is known about the relationship between race/ethnicity and 
      depression among US blacks. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence, persistence, 
      treatment, and disability of depression in African Americans, Caribbean blacks, 
      and non-Hispanic whites in the National Survey of American Life. DESIGN: A 
      slightly modified adaptation of the World Health Organization World Mental Health 
      version of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. SETTING: National 
      household probability samples of noninstitutionalized African Americans, 
      Caribbean blacks, and non-Hispanic whites in the United States conducted between 
      February 2, 2001, and June 30, 2003. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 3570 African 
      Americans, 1621 Caribbean blacks, and 891 non-Hispanic whites aged 18 years and 
      older (N = 6082). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of 
      DSM-IV major depressive disorder (MDD), 12-month mental health services use, and 
      MDD disability as quantified using the Sheehan Disability Scale and the World 
      Health Organization's Disability Assessment Schedule II. RESULTS: Lifetime MDD 
      prevalence estimates were highest for whites (17.9%), followed by Caribbean 
      blacks (12.9%) and African Americans (10.4%); however, 12-month MDD estimates 
      across groups were similar. The chronicity of MDD was higher for both black 
      groups (56.5% for African Americans and 56.0% for Caribbean blacks) than for 
      whites (38.6%). Fewer than half of the African Americans (45.0%) and fewer than a 
      quarter (24.3%) of the Caribbean blacks who met the criteria received any form of 
      MDD therapy. In addition, relative to whites, both black groups were more likely 
      to rate their MDD as severe or very severe and more disabling. CONCLUSIONS: When 
      MDD affects African Americans and Caribbean blacks, it is usually untreated and 
      is more severe and disabling compared with that in non-Hispanic whites. The 
      burden of mental disorders, especially depressive disorders, may be higher among 
      US blacks than in US whites.

TI  - Examining the role of context in the implementation of a deliberative public 
      participation experiment: results from a Canadian comparative study.
PG  - 2115-28
AB  - To resolve tensions among competing sources of evidence and public expectations, 
      health-care managers and policy makers are turning more than ever to involve the 
      public in a wide range of decisions. Yet efforts to use research evidence to 
      inform public involvement decisions are hampered by an absence of rigorous public 
      participation evaluation research. In particular, greater rigour in exploring the 
      roles played by different contextual variables--such as characteristics of the 
      issue of interest, the culture of the sponsoring organization and attributes of 
      the decision being made--is needed. Using a comparative quasi-experimental 
      design, we assessed the performance of a generic public participation method 
      implemented in 5 Canadian regionalized health settings between 2001 and 2004. 
      Participant and decision-maker perspectives were assessed and, through direct 
      observation, the roles exerted by contextual variables over the public 
      involvement processes were documented and analysed. Our findings demonstrate that 
      a generic public participation method can be implemented in a variety of contexts 
      and with considerable success. Context exerts fostering and inhibiting influences 
      that contribute to more (or less) successful implementation. Public participation 
      practitioners are encouraged to pay careful attention to the types of issues and 
      decisions for which they are seeking public input. Sufficient organizational 
      resources and commitment to the goals of the public participation process are 
      also required. Attention to these contextual attributes and their influence on 
      the design and outcomes of public participation processes is as important as 
      choosing the "right" public participation mechanism.

TI  - Respiratory irregularity and stress hormones in panic disorder: exploring 
      potential linkages.
PG  - 885-7
AB  - Dysregulation within both respiratory control systems and the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis has been implicated in the 
      pathophysiological of panic disorder. However, potential linkages between 
      respiration and the HPA axis have rarely been examined in panic patients. We have 
      previously published neuroendocrine and psychophysiological response data from a 
      laboratory panic model using the respiratory stimulant doxapram. We now present a 
      new, theoretically driven re-examination of linkages between HPA axis and 
      respiratory measures in this model. Previous analyses showed elevated 
      corticotropin (ACTH) and persistent tidal volume irregularity in panic patients, 
      due to a high frequency of sighs. Regression analyses now show that tidal volume 
      irregularity and sigh frequency were strongly predicted by pre-challenge ACTH 
      levels, but not by subjective distress or panic symptoms. We predicted this 
      relationship on the basis of our hypothesis that both the HPA axis and 
      respiratory control systems may be reactive to contextual cues such as novelty or 
      anticipation of future challenge. Follow-up work is needed to directly test this 
      hypothesis.

TI  - Paralimbic and medial prefrontal cortical involvement in neuroendocrine responses 
      to traumatic stimuli.
PG  - 1250-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity and cortisol release are 
      consequences of central stress system activation, but they may also influence 
      cognitive and emotional processes within the brain. Despite the importance of 
      central stress response systems, little is known about the specific brain 
      circuits through which psychosocial stimuli activate the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and through which cortisol feedback modulates 
      central processing. The authors used [(15)O]H(2)O positron emission tomography 
      (PET) on subjects with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) to study these 
      circuits. METHOD: Participants were combat-PTSD patients, combat-exposed healthy 
      comparison subjects, and noncombat-exposed healthy comparison subjects. 
      Participants were scanned using [(15)O]H(2)O PET while they experienced a series 
      of emotional-induction conditions, which included aversive pictures and 
      autobiographic narratives. Blood samples were obtained 2 minutes before and 5 
      minutes after each activation scan in order to measure the subjects' plasma 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels. RESULTS: In voxel-wise analyses, 
      the authors found that adrenocorticotropic hormone responses were covaried with 
      regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex, 
      rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and right insula, with some differences 
      between PTSD patients and comparison subjects. Prestimulus cortisol levels 
      covaried with rCBF responses in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex. In 
      combat-PTSD patients only, prestimulus cortisol levels covaried with rCBF in the 
      subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence 
      of cortical involvement in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to 
      psychological stimuli, specifically implicating the insula, dorsal medial 
      prefrontal cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. These findings also 
      show, for the first time, that cortisol may modulate activity in specific brain 
      areas such as the rostral and subgenual anterior cingulate cortices. Differential 
      patterns of covariation between combat veterans with and without PTSD potentially 
      implicate the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate 
      cortex as areas of dysregulation in PTSD.

TI  - Alternatives to project-specific consent for access to personal information for 
      health research: what is the opinion of the Canadian public?
PG  - 706-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine public opinion on alternatives to 
      project-specific consent for use of their personal information for health 
      research. DESIGN: The authors conducted a fixed-response random-digit dialed 
      telephone survey of 1,230 adults across Canada. MEASUREMENTS: We measured 
      attitudes toward privacy and health research; trust in different institutions to 
      keep information confidential; and consent choice for research use of one's own 
      health information involving medical record review, automated abstraction of 
      information from the electronic medical record, and linking education or income 
      with health data. RESULTS: Support was strong for both health research and 
      privacy protection. Studying communicable diseases and quality of health care had 
      greatest support (85% to 89%). Trust was highest for data institutes, university 
      researchers, hospitals, and disease foundations (78% to 80%). Four percent of 
      respondents thought information from their paper medical record should not be 
      used at all for research, 32% thought permission should be obtained for each use, 
      29% supported broad consent, 24% supported notification and opt out, and 11% felt 
      no need for notification or consent. Opinions were more polarized for automated 
      abstraction of data from the electronic medical record. Respondents were more 
      willing to link education with health data than income. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the 
      public supported alternatives to study-specific consent, but few supported use 
      without any notification or consent. Consent choices for research use of one's 
      health information should be documented in the medical record. The challenge 
      remains how best to elicit those choices and ensure that they are up-to-date.

TI  - Cell-free circularization of viroid progeny RNA by an RNA ligase from wheat germ.
PG  - 1147-9
AB  - Linear, potato spindle tuber viroid RNA has been used as a substrate for an RNA 
      ligase purified from wheat germ. Linear viroid molecules are efficiently 
      converted to circular molecules (circles) which are indistinguishable by 
      electrophoretic mobility and two-dimensional oligonucleotide pattern from viroid 
      circles extracted from infected plants. In light of recent evidence for 
      multimeric viroid replication intermediates, cleavage followed by RNA ligation by 
      a cellular enzyme may (i) be a normal step in the viroid life cycle and (ii) may 
      also reflect cellular events.

TI  - Volatile magnesium octahydrotriborate complexes as potential CVD precursors to 
      MgB2. Synthesis and characterization of Mg(B3H8)2 and its etherates.
PG  - 9060-6
AB  - The solid-state reaction of MgBr2 and NaB3H8 at 20 degrees C, followed by 
      sublimation at 80 degrees C and 0.05 Torr, affords Mg(B3H8)2 as a white solid. 
      Similar reactions with MgBr2(Et2O) and MgBr2(Me2O)1.5 afford the crystalline 
      ether adducts Mg(B3H8)2(Et2O)2 and Mg(B3H8)2(Me2O)2, respectively. In contrast, 
      reactions of MgBr2 with NaB3H8, the presence of excess solvent result in the 
      formation of nonvolatile, probably ionic, magnesium compounds of the type 
      [MgLx][B3H8]2. The adducts Mg(B3H8)2(Et2O)2 and Mg(B3H8)2(Me2O)2 are the first 
      crystallographically characterized magnesium complexes of the B3H8- ligand; in 
      both structures, the magnesium center adopts a distorted cis-octahedral geometry 
      with two bidentate B3H8 groups and two Et2O ligands. Owing to their volatility, 
      Mg(B3H8)2(Et2O)2 and Mg(B3H8)2(Me2O)2 are potential precursors for the deposition 
      of MgB2 thin films, although preliminary efforts to employ them as chemical vapor 
      deposition sources produce boron-rich MgBx films instead, with x approximately 7. 
      Finally, the synthesis and structure of Cp2Mg(thf) are described: this mono-thf 
      adduct of Cp2Mg bears two eta5-Cp groups, unlike other Lewis base adducts of 
      Cp2Mg, which contain one eta5-Cp group and one eta1- or eta2-Cp group.

TI  - Molecular cytogenetic analysis and resequencing of contactin associated 
      protein-like 2 in autism spectrum disorders.
PG  - 165-73
LID - 10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.017 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of related neurodevelopmental 
      syndromes with complex genetic etiology. We identified a de novo chromosome 7q 
      inversion disrupting Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (AUTS2) and Contactin 
      Associated Protein-Like 2 (CNTNAP2) in a child with cognitive and social delay. 
      We focused our initial analysis on CNTNAP2 based on our demonstration of 
      disruption of Contactin 4 (CNTN4) in a patient with ASD; the recent finding of 
      rare homozygous mutations in CNTNAP2 leading to intractable seizures and autism; 
      and in situ and biochemical analyses reported herein that confirm expression in 
      relevant brain regions and demonstrate the presence of CNTNAP2 in the synaptic 
      plasma membrane fraction of rat forebrain lysates. We comprehensively resequenced 
      CNTNAP2 in 635 patients and 942 controls. Among patients, we identified a total 
      of 27 nonsynonymous changes; 13 were rare and unique to patients and 8 of these 
      were predicted to be deleterious by bioinformatic approaches and/or altered 
      residues conserved across all species. One variant at a highly conserved 
      position, I869T, was inherited by four affected children in three unrelated 
      families, but was not found in 4010 control chromosomes (p = 0.014). Overall, 
      this resequencing data demonstrated a modest nonsignificant increase in the 
      burden of rare variants in cases versus controls. Nonetheless, when viewed in 
      light of two independent studies published in this issue of AJHG showing a 
      relationship between ASD and common CNTNAP2 alleles, the cytogenetic and mutation 
      screening data suggest that rare variants may also contribute to the 
      pathophysiology of ASD, but place limits on the magnitude of this contribution.

AB  - Pentagastrin is a cholecystokinin (CCK)-B agonist and laboratory panicogenic 
      agent that produces endocrine (ACTH and cortisol), symptom (anxiety, panic) and 
      cardiovascular (heart rate) responses. Although in vitro data have supported its 
      chemical stability, preliminary data suggested that increasing time between drug 
      preparation and drug infusion could reduce the magnitude of endocrine and symptom 
      responses. The current study examined this possibility. Twenty-one healthy 
      subjects presented at the University of Michigan General Clinical Research Center 
      (GCRC) and had an intravenous catheter inserted. Heart rate, cortisol levels and 
      subjective anxiety were measured before and after pentagastrin and placebo 
      injections. Pentagastrin was prepared either within 60 min of IV infusion (Normal 
      Preparation group) or at least 3.5 h prior to infusion (Early Preparation group). 
      Relative to the Normal Preparation group, Early Preparation subjects had similar 
      heart rate responses but significantly smaller cortisol and subjective anxiety 
      responses. Early preparation of pentagastrin thus appears to weaken endocrine and 
      subjective anxiety responses, highlighting the importance of attending to often 
      overlooked procedural variables (e.g., time between preparation and 
      administration) in studies of this type. The sensitivity of cortisol and anxiety 
      responses to preparation time, but insensitivity of heart rate, is consistent 
      with previous studies suggesting different thresholds of activation for the three 
      response modalities. These differential sensitivities may suggest different and 
      separable CCK-B stimulated pathways for each response, which combine to produce 
      panic, rather than a single, unified CCK-B mediated panicogenic response.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis may mediate negative 
      health effects of stress. It is sensitive to cognitive/emotional factors like 
      novelty, perceived control, and coping. Psychological intervention that reduces 
      novelty and enhances cognitive coping and sense of control can reduce cortisol 
      responses to pentagastrin, a pharmacological HPA activator. This study attempted 
      to identify the core factors that modulate HPA axis activity in this model. 
      METHODS: Varying instructions were administered prior to drug exposure in a 
      two-visit (placebo first) pentagastrin infusion paradigm. Healthy subjects (n = 
      40) were randomly assigned to one of four instruction groups: 1) standard 
      instruction (SI); 2) full cognitive intervention (CI); 3) the CI control 
      component alone; or 4) the CI novelty reduction/coping components alone. Blood 
      samples were obtained via intravenous catheter before and after pentagastrin. 
      RESULTS: Subjects receiving an intervention had smaller cortisol responses than 
      subjects receiving standard instructions. Coping alone had as strong an impact as 
      the more complex intervention that combined coping and control. Control alone 
      also reduced cortisol but its HPA impact appeared less robust. CONCLUSIONS: Brief 
      psychological manipulation can significantly reduce HPA activation in challenge 
      paradigms. Cognitive preparation that focused on side effects, reduced potential 
      surprise, and enhanced cognitive coping modulated HPA axis activity as 
      effectively as a previously tested intervention that combined coping and control 
      manipulations. A sense of control alone also reduced cortisol release. The 
      results support development of control or coping techniques to combat negative 
      health effects of stress that are mediated by HPA axis activation.

TI  - Mental health service delivery in Ontario, Canada: how do policy legacies shape 
      prospects for reform?
PG  - 363-89
LID - 10.1017/S1744133107004318 [doi]
AB  - Like many jurisdictions, mental health policy-making in Ontario, Canada, has a 
      long history of frustrated attempts to move from a hospital and physician-based 
      tradition to a coordinated system with greater emphasis on community-based mental 
      health care. This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction 
      of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and of public health insurance (medicare) 
      in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform 
      initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we 
      capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on 
      three groups of actors: government elites, interests, and mass publics. Data are 
      drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The 
      findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy produced important policy 
      legacies which were reinforced by the establishment of Canadian medicare. These 
      legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, 
      but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support 
      community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system presents an 
      opportunity to overcome several of these legacies. Analysis of policy legacies in 
      other countries which had an asylum tradition may help to explain the 
      similarities and differences in their subsequent paths of mental health reform.

TI  - Naturalistic stress and cortisol response to awakening: adaptation to seafaring.
PG  - 1023-6
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2008.04.011 [doi]
AB  - Study of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis has been critical to 
      advancing our understanding of human adaptation to stress. The cortisol response 
      to awakening (CRA) is a potentially useful measure for understanding group and 
      individual differences in HPA axis regulation. In this study, the CRA was 
      examined in the context of a naturalistic stressor--a 6-week voyage of work and 
      study aboard an oceangoing ship, including both experienced and novice sailors. 
      Thirty-one subjects provided weekday and weekend baseline CRA data onshore prior 
      to boarding, followed by three CRAs at sea and one shore leave CRA. Subjective 
      measures of sleep, stress and control were also collected. Results suggest that 
      novice sailors' cortisol response to awakening was elevated at sea relative to 
      both a shoreside weekend and a shore leave during the voyage, but the most 
      striking elevation was found during a workday onshore. Inexperienced students' 
      profiles changed differently over the course of the voyage from those of 
      professional crew. CRAs were not affected by sleep variables and were not 
      predicted by subjective ratings. These data support the value of the cortisol 
      response to awakening as a neuroendocrine marker of HPA regulatory responses to a 
      naturalistic stressor, influenced by changes in work and living environment, and 
      perhaps prior experience with the stressor.

      descent: results from the National Survey of American Life.
PG  - 993-1005

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited research regarding the nature and prevalence of 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) among various racial and ethnic 
      subpopulations within the United States, including African Americans and blacks 
      of Caribbean descent. Although heterogeneity within the black population in the 
      United States has largely been ignored, notable differences exist between blacks 
      of Caribbean descent and African Americans with respect to ethnicity, national 
      heritage, and living circumstances. This is the first comprehensive examination 
      of OCD among African Americans and blacks of Caribbean descent. METHODS: Data 
      from the National Survey of American Life, a national household probability 
      sample of African Americans and Caribbean blacks in the United States, were used 
      to examine rates of OCD among these groups. RESULTS: Lifetime and 12-month OCD 
      prevalence estimates were very similar for African Americans and Caribbean 
      blacks. Persistence of OCD and rates of co-occurring psychiatric disorders were 
      very high and also similar between African American and Caribbean black 
      respondents. Both groups had high levels of overall mental illness severity and 
      functional impairment. Use of services was low for both groups, particularly in 
      specialty mental health settings. Use of anti-obsessional medications was also 
      rare, especially among the Caribbean black OCD population. CONCLUSIONS: OCD among 
      African Americans and Caribbean blacks is very persistent, often accompanied by 
      other psychiatric disorders, and is associated with high overall mental illness 
      severity and functional impairment. It is also likely that very few blacks in the 
      United States with OCD are receiving evidence-based treatment and thus 
      considerable effort is needed to bring treatment to these groups.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of consent for research use of health information is 
      contentious. Most discussion has focused on when project-specific consent may be 
      waived but, recently, a broader range of consent options has been entertained, 
      including broad opt-in for multiple studies with restrictions and notification 
      with opt-out. We sought to elicit public values in this matter and to work toward 
      an agreement about a common approach to consent for use of personal information 
      for health research through deliberative public dialogues. METHODS: We conducted 
      seven day-long public dialogues, involving 98 participants across Canada. 
      Immediately before and after each dialogue, participants completed a 
      fixed-response questionnaire rating individuals' support for 3 approaches to 
      consent in the abstract and their consent choices for 5 health research scenarios 
      using personal information. They also rated how confident different safeguards 
      made them feel that their information was being used responsibly. RESULTS: Broad 
      opt-in consent for use of personal information garnered the greatest support in 
      the abstract. When presented with specific research scenarios, no one approach to 
      consent predominated. When profit was introduced into the scenarios, consent 
      choices shifted toward greater control over use. Despite lively and constructive 
      dialogues, and considerable shifting in opinion at the individual level, at the 
      end of the day, there was no substantive aggregate movement in opinion. Personal 
      controls were among the most commonly cited approaches to improving people's 
      confidence in the responsible use of their information for research. CONCLUSION: 
      Because no one approach to consent satisfied even a simple majority of dialogue 
      participants and the importance placed on personal controls, a mechanism should 
      be developed for documenting consent choice for different types of research, 
      including ways for individuals to check who has accessed their medical record for 
      purposes other than clinical care. This could be done, for example, through a 
      web-based patient portal to their electronic health record. Researchers and 
      policy makers should continue to engage the public to promote greater public 
      understanding of the research process and to look for feasible alternatives to 
      existing approaches to project-specific consent for observational research.

TI  - Growth inhibition to enhance conformal coverage in thin film chemical vapor 
      deposition.
PG  - 17660-1
LID - 10.1021/ja807802r [doi]
AB  - We introduce the use of a growth inhibitor to enhance thin film conformality in 
      low temperature chemical vapor deposition. Films of TiB(2) grown from the single 
      source precursor Ti(BH(4))(3)(dme) are much more highly conformal when grown in 
      the presence of one of the film growth byproducts, 1,2-dimethoxyethane (dme). 
      This effect can be explained in terms of two alternative inhibitory mechanisms: 
      one involving blocking of surface reactive sites, which is equivalent to reducing 
      the rate of the forward reaction leading to film growth, the other analogous to 
      Le Chatelier's principle, in which the addition of a reaction product increases 
      the rate of the back reaction. The reduction in growth rate corresponds to a 
      reduction in the sticking probability of the precursor, which enhances 
      conformality by enabling the precursor to diffuse deeper into a recessed feature 
      before it reacts.

TI  - Impact of social anxiety disorder on employment among women receiving welfare 
      benefits.
PG  - 61-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies in clinical and community samples have documented that social 
      anxiety disorder is common, disabling, and costly. It reduces educational 
      attainment and job success, and thus it may undermine economic self-sufficiency. 
      The authors examined whether social anxiety disorder was an obstacle to 
      successful employment in a longitudinal epidemiological study of women receiving 
      welfare in an urban Michigan county. The hypothesis that social anxiety disorder 
      would predict reduced work attainment was examined. METHODS: Psychiatric 
      diagnoses were established with the Composite International Diagnostic 
      Interview-Short Form. The authors conducted a linear fixed-effects regression 
      analysis for survey data with 609 respondents who completed at least the third 
      wave of the Women's Employment Study in order to explore obstacles to employment 
      among mothers on welfare. RESULTS: Analyses demonstrated that compared with 
      respondents without social anxiety disorder, those with this disorder worked 
      fewer months. The impact of social anxiety disorder was independent of and more 
      striking than the effects of depression. CONCLUSIONS: By undermining efforts to 
      obtain or maintain employment, social anxiety disorder poses a significant, 
      unrecognized impediment to efforts to reduce welfare reliance and to help 
      recipients achieve economic self-sufficiency. Because recipients may lose 
      benefits if they fail to enter the workforce rapidly and if they exceed time 
      limits for support, those with social anxiety disorder are at risk of extreme 
      economic hardship. Improved access to effective treatments in this population 
      could have significant public health and economic benefits.

TI  - What does it mean to trust a health system? A qualitative study of Canadian 
      health care values.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.11.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used a qualitative empirical study of Canadians' values toward 
      their health system to develop more meaningful conceptualizations of trust and 
      health systems that can inform the pursuit of more trustworthy health systems. 
      METHODS: We convened nine focus groups in three Canadian cities in 2002 and 2004 
      in conjunction with a national public opinion telephone survey of Canadians' 
      attitudes and values toward their health system. Health system trust emerged as a 
      significant theme in focus group discussions and was investigated using a 
      modified grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: Respondents construct cleavages and 
      alliances to position themselves in relation to different features of the trusted 
      health system. The health system and Canadian Medicare are identified sources of 
      trust just as are individual health care providers. Core to the trust 
      relationship is the experience of vulnerability which provides the impetus for 
      placing trust (in providers, governments and health systems) or seeds distrust, 
      mistrust and resilience in the same. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a more robust 
      conceptualization of what it means to trust a health system. Policy maker efforts 
      to intervene to restore lost trust could usefully be informed by these findings.

TI  - Public participation in health care priority setting: A scoping review.
PG  - 219-28
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.01.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While much literature has debated public engagement in health care 
      decision-making, there is no consensus on when public engagement should be sought 
      and how it should be obtained. We conducted a scoping review to examine public 
      engagement in one specific area: priority setting and resource allocation. 
      METHOD: The review drew upon a broad range of health and non-health literature in 
      an attempt to elicit what is known and not known on this topic, and through this 
      to outline any guidance to assist decision-makers and identify where efforts for 
      future research should be directed. RESULTS: Governments appear to recognize 
      benefits in consulting multiple publics using a range of methods, though more 
      traditional approaches to engagement continue to predominate. There appears to be 
      growing interest in deliberative approaches to public engagement, which are more 
      commonly on-going rather than one-off and more apt to involve face-to-face 
      contact. However, formal evaluation of public engagement efforts is rare. Also 
      absent is any real effort to demonstrate how public views might be integrated 
      with other decision inputs when allocating social resources. CONCLUSION: While 
      some strands can be taken to inform current priority setting activity, this 
      scoping review identified many gaps and highlights numerous areas for further 
      research.

TI  - Joining the conversation: newspaper journalists' views on working with 
      researchers.
PG  - 123-39
AB  - For health researchers who seek more research use in policy making to improve 
      health and healthcare, working with the news media may represent an opportunity, 
      given the media's pivotal role in public policy agenda-setting. Much literature 
      on science and health journalism assumes a normative stance, focusing on 
      improving the accuracy of news coverage. In this study, we investigated 
      journalists' perspectives and experiences. We were particularly interested in 
      learning how health researchers could work constructively with journalists as a 
      means to increase research use in policy making. Qualitative methods were used to 
      conduct and analyze interviews with experienced newspaper journalists across 
      Canada, with children's mental health as a content example. In response, study 
      participants emphasized journalistic processes more than the content of news 
      coverage, whether children's mental health or other topics. Instead, they focused 
      on what they thought researchers needed to know about journalists' roles, 
      practices and views on working with researchers. Newspaper journalists balance 
      business and social responsibilities according to their respective roles as 
      editors, columnists and reporters. In practice, journalists must ensure 
      newsworthiness, relevance to readers and access to sources in a context of daily 
      deadlines. As generalists, journalists rely on researchers to be expert 
      interpreters, although they find many researchers unavailable or unable to 
      communicate with public audiences. While journalists are skeptical about such 
      common organizational communications tools as news releases, they welcome the 
      uncommon contributions of those researchers who cultivate relationships and 
      invest time to synthesize and communicate research evidence on an ongoing basis. 
      Some appealed for more researchers to join them in participating in public 
      conversations. We conclude that there are opportunities for policy-oriented 
      health researchers to work constructively with newspaper journalists--by 
      appreciating journalists' perspectives and by taking seriously some of their 
      suggestions for engaging in public conversations--and that such engagement can be 
      a means to increase the use of research evidence in policy making and thereby 
      improve health and healthcare.

TI  - Media Hyping and the "Herceptin Access Story": An Analysis of Canadian and UK 
      Newspaper Coverage.
PG  - e113-28
AB  - In May 2005, preliminary trial results pronouncing the effectiveness of Herceptin 
      (trastuzumab) for treatment of early-stage breast cancer were disseminated at a 
      high-profile scientific meeting. Herceptin was subsequently approved for use in 
      the public healthcare systems of Canada and the United Kingdom, although the 
      differences between the two decision timelines were stark. The authors compared 
      UK and Canadian newspaper coverage of the Herceptin story to assess how it may 
      have been "hyped" in each country. They analyzed a diverse sample of newspapers 
      and coded clippings for reporters' framing of the drug's efficacy, costs and 
      funding approval process. Canadian news coverage preceded formal publication of 
      the trial results, while UK coverage mirrored major national events. Reporters in 
      both countries used predominantly individualistic perspectives and framed 
      Herceptin's efficacy in salutary terms. Framing of costs was more neutral in 
      Canadian than in UK newspapers. Funding approval framing focused on inequitable 
      access in the UK and timeliness in Canada. News coverage of drug access stories 
      varies across jurisdictions in terms of intensity and some aspects of framing. 
      Such variations likely reflect different journalistic practices and dominant

AB  - Neural substrates underlying psychological activation of the 
      limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (LHPA) axis are not well understood in 
      humans. Trauma recall (using autobiographical script-driven imagery) may provide 
      a model to study neural circuitry involved in LHPA axis activation to personally 
      threatening psychological stimuli. This study sought to identify brain activation 
      patterns that differentiated combat veterans who mounted an LHPA response to 
      trauma recall from those who did not. Twenty-five Vietnam combat veterans (14 
      with current PTSD, 11 with no PTSD history) experienced autobiographic 
      script-driven imagery in an [(15)O] H(2)O positron emission tomography (PET) 
      paradigm with recurrent blood sampling. Trauma recall elicited acute ACTH 
      responses in some but not all veterans, regardless of the PTSD status and 
      independent of emotional responses. ACTH responders (mean ACTH increase of 24+/-7 
      pg/ml, n=13) were compared to non-responders (mean decrease of -0.6+/-0.6 pg/ml, 
      n=12) in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Both groups activated right insula 
      (BA13) in response to trauma recall. However, ACTH responders deactivated rostral 
      mPFC (BA10)/rostral ACC (BA32), whereas non-responders activated this same mPFC 
      region, and deactivated amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal pole. In group 
      contrasts comparing ACTH responders to non-responders, the responders had 
      significantly higher rCBF in right insula and right temporal pole, whereas 
      non-responders had higher rCBF in rostral mPFC and dorsal ACC. These results 
      support the hypotheses that right insula is involved in psychological activation 
      of the LHPA axis and that rostral mPFC may negatively modulate LHPA axis 
      responses.

TI  - Lessons learned from the clinical reappraisal study of the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview with Latinos.
PG  - 84-95
LID - 10.1002/mpr.280 [doi]
AB  - Given recent adaptations of the World Health Organization's World Mental Health 
      Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WMH-CIDI), new methodological 
      studies are needed to evaluate the concordance of CIDI diagnoses with clinical 
      diagnostic interviews. This paper summarizes lessons learned from a clinical 
      reappraisal study done with US Latinos. We compare CIDI diagnoses with 
      independent clinical diagnosis using the World Mental Health Structured Clinical 
      Interview for DSM-IV (WMH-SCID 2000). Three sub-samples stratified by diagnostic 
      status (CIDI positive, CIDI negative, or CIDI sub-threshold for a disorder) based 
      on nine disorders were randomly selected for a telephone re-interview using the 
      SCID. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and weight-adjusted Cohen's kappa. 
      Weighted 12 month prevalence estimates of the SCID are slightly higher than those 
      of the CIDI for generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol abuse/dependence, and drug 
      abuse/dependence. For Latinos, CIDI-SCID concordance at the aggregate disorder 
      level is comparable, albeit lower, to other published reports. The CIDI does very 
      well identifying negative cases and classifying disorders at the aggregate level. 
      Good concordance was also found for major depressive episode and panic disorder. 
      Yet, our data suggests that the CIDI presents problems for assessing 
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). 
      Recommendations on how to improve future versions of the CIDI for Latinos are 
      offered.

TI  - Cognitive modulation of endocrine responses to CRH stimulation in healthy 
      subjects.
PG  - 451-9
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.08.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis is critical for 
      biobehavioral adaptation to challenge and appears dysregulated in a range of 
      psychiatric disorders. Its precise role in psychopathology remains unclear and 
      discrepant and difficult to explain findings abound in the clinical literature. 
      Basic research suggests this system is sensitive to psychosocial cues, but 
      psychosocial milieu factors are rarely controlled or examined in psychiatric 
      studies using biological probes of the HPA axis. To test the hypothesis that 
      psychological factors might complicate HPA study results even in direct, 
      pharmacological challenge paradigms, endocrine responses to 
      corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) were examined under two different cognitive 
      preparation conditions. METHODS: Healthy subjects (n=32) received standard 
      instructions or a cognitive intervention (CI) prior to injection with CRH and 
      placebo, given on separate days in random order. The CI combined access to 
      control over drug exposure with novelty reduction and coping enhancement. Blood 
      samples were obtained via intravenous catheter before and after CRH. RESULTS: 
      Cognitive intervention reduced corticotropin (ACTH) levels, but only when CRH was 
      given first (intervention by order interaction). It did not reduce cortisol 
      response. The CI and visit (1st or 2nd) both impacted cortisol levels on placebo 
      day. CONCLUSIONS: Modifiable psychological factors may amplify or inhibit HPA 
      axis activity in pharmacological activation paradigms, including CRH stimulation 
      tests. The factors manipulated by the CI (novelty/familiarity, control and 
      coping) may have particular salience to the HPA axis. Differential sensitivity to 
      such factors could impact results in studies applying biological HPA probes to 
      psychiatric populations.

PG  - 607-12
LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.09.017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is considerable anecdotal and some scientific evidence that 
      stress triggers eating behavior, but underlying physiological mechanisms remain 
      uncertain. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a key mediator of 
      physiological stress responses and may play a role in the link between stress and 
      food intake. Cortisol responses to laboratory stressors predict consumption but 
      it is unclear whether such responses mark a vulnerability to stress-related 
      eating or whether cortisol directly stimulates eating in humans. METHODS: We 
      infused healthy adults with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) at a dose that 
      is subjectively undetectable but elicits a robust endogenous cortisol response, 
      and measured subsequent intake of snack foods, allowing analysis of HPA 
      reactivity effects on food intake without the complex psychological effects of a 
      stress paradigm. RESULTS: CRH elevated cortisol levels relative to placebo but 
      did not impact subjective anxious distress. Subjects ate more following CRH than 
      following placebo and peak cortisol response to CRH was strongly related to both 
      caloric intake and total consumption. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that HPA axis 
      reactivity to pharmacological stimulation predicts subsequent food intake and 
      suggest that cortisol itself may directly stimulate food consumption in humans. 
      Understanding the physiological mechanisms that underlie stress-related eating 
      may prove useful in efforts to attack the public health crises created by 
      obesity.

LID - 10.1002/da.20624 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study examined associations between anxiety and work-related 
      outcomes in an anxiety disorders clinic population, examining both pretreatment 
      links and the impact of anxiety change over 12 weeks of treatment on work 
      outcomes. Four validated instruments were used to also allow examination of their 
      psychometric properties, with the goal of improving measurement of work-related 
      quality of life in this population. METHODS: Newly enrolled adult patients 
      seeking treatment in a university-based anxiety clinic were administered four 
      work performance measures: Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ), Work 
      Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire (WPAI), Endicott Work 
      Productivity Scale (EWPS), and Functional Status Questionnaire Work Performance 
      Scale (WPS). Anxiety severity was determined using the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
      (BAI). The Clinical Global Impressions, Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I) was 
      completed by patients to evaluate symptom change at a 12-week follow-up. Two 
      severity groups (minimal/mild vs. moderate/severe, based on baseline BAI score) 
      were compared to each other on work measures. RESULTS: Eighty-one patients 
      provided complete baseline data. Anxiety severity groups did not differ in job 
      type, time on job, job satisfaction, or job choice. Patients with greater anxiety 
      generally showed lower work performance on all instruments. Job advancement was 
      impaired for the moderate/severe group. The multi-item performance scales 
      demonstrated better validity and internal consistency. The WLQ and the WPAI 
      detected change with symptom improvement. CONCLUSION: Level of work performance 
      was generally associated with severity of anxiety. Of the instruments tested, the 
      WLQ and the WPAI questionnaire demonstrated acceptable validity and internal 
      reliability.

AB  - Phase transformation generally begins with nucleation, in which a small aggregate 
      of atoms organizes into a different structural symmetry. The thermodynamic 
      driving forces and kinetic rates have been predicted by classical nucleation 
      theory, but observation of nanometer-scale nuclei has not been possible, except 
      on exposed surfaces. We used a statistical technique called fluctuation 
      transmission electron microscopy to detect nuclei embedded in a glassy solid, and 
      we used a laser pump-probe technique to determine the role of these nuclei in 
      crystallization. This study provides a convincing proof of the time- and 
      temperature-dependent development of nuclei, information that will play a 
      critical role in the development of advanced materials for phase-change memories.

LID - 10.1021/ja9098005 [doi]
AB  - New lanthanide CVD precursors of stoichiometry Ln(H(3)BNMe(2)BH(3))(3) have been 
      prepared, where Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, and Lu. The 
      ligand is N,N-dimethylaminodiboranate, a new kind of multidentate borohydride. 
      The structures of the Ln(H(3)BNMe(2)BH(3))(3) complexes are highly dependent on 
      the size of the lanthanide ions: the coordination number decreases from Pr (CN = 
      14) to Sm (CN = 13) to Er (CN = 12) corresponding with the decrease in ionic 
      radii. The Ln(H(3)BNMe(2)BH(3))(3) complexes are highly volatile and sublime at 
      temperatures as low as 65 degrees C in vacuum. These complexes are useful CVD 
      precursors; for example, Y(H(3)BNMe(2)BH(3))(3) has been used to deposit Y(2)O(3) 
      on silicon at 300 degrees C by CVD using water as a coreactant.

TI  - HPA axis, respiration and the airways in stress--a review in search of 
      intersections.
PG  - 57-65
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.01.021 [doi]
AB  - Given clear connections between respiratory distress and subjective anxiety, it 
      is not surprising that respiratory psychophysiologists have been interested in 
      the psychobiology of anxiety. Given parallel links between anxiety and stress, it 
      is not surprising that the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal (HPA) stress system has 
      also been a focus in anxiety research. However, despite extensive work in 
      respiratory psychophysiology and stress neuroendocrinology--and evidence that 
      these systems are jointly dysregulated in anxiety disorders--direct studies of 
      their interactions are rare. This paper reviews evidence for scientific 
      intersections, providing an overview of the HPA axis, its psychobiology, and 
      shared neural substrates for HPA and respiratory control. We examine HPA hormone 
      effects on respiration, immune/inflammatory mediators, and lung maturation. We 
      also examine respiratory/dyspnea effects on HPA axis. There are clear points of 
      intersection in the neuroscience of respiration and stress. Given the importance 
      of both systems to an organism's ability to survive and adapt in challenging and 
      changing environments, further study of their interactions is needed.

AB  - The prevalence of panic disorder (PD) in patients with chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease (COPD) is significantly higher than that in the general 
      population. Comorbid anxiety disorders in COPD are associated with a number of 
      worse outcomes, however little is known about the mechanisms by which PD affects 
      patients with COPD. We hypothesized that patients with COPD and PD would have 
      greater dyspnea severity, but not greater somatosensory sensitivity, to dyspneic 
      stimuli. We studied 10 patients with COPD and PD, 9 patients with COPD without 
      PD, and 9 healthy, matched controls. Participants were administered the Anxiety 
      Sensitivity Index-3. We tested interoceptive sensitivity using a respiratory load 
      detection protocol and dyspnea ratings in response to inspiratory resistive 
      loads. Participants with COPD and PD had higher anxiety sensitivity scores and 
      reported greater dyspnea in response to resistive loads. However no group 
      differences were found in resistive load detection threshold. Anxiety sensitivity 
      scores accounted for a significant amount of the variance in the group difference 
      in dyspnea ratings. Patients with COPD and PD do not show heightened 
      interoceptive sensitivity, but report greater dyspnea to inspiratory resistive 
      loads. Emotional responses to dyspneic sensations may account for higher dyspnea 
      ratings in patients with PD and COPD.

TI  - "It all depends": conceptualizing public involvement in the context of health 
      technology assessment agencies.
PG  - 1518-26
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.036 [doi]
AB  - There have been calls in recent years for greater public involvement in health 
      technology assessment (HTA). Yet the concept of public involvement is poorly 
      articulated and little attention has been paid to the context of HTA agencies. 
      This article investigates how public involvement is conceptualized in the HTA 
      agency environment. Using qualitative concept analysis methods, we reviewed the 
      HTA literature and the websites of HTA agencies and conducted semi-structured 
      interviews with informants in Canada, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Our 
      analysis reveals that HTA agencies' role as bridges or boundary organizations 
      situated at the frontier of research and policymaking causes the agencies to 
      struggle with the idea of public involvement. The HTA community is concerned with 
      conceptualizing public involvement in such a way as to meet scientific and 
      methodological standards without neglecting its responsibilities to healthcare 
      policymakers. We offer a conceptual tool for analyzing the nature of public 
      involvement across agencies, characterizing different domains, levels of 
      involvement, and types of publics.

AB  - Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show an increased error-related 
      negativity (ERN), yet previous studies have not controlled for medication use, 
      which may be important given evidence linking performance monitoring to 
      neurotransmitter systems targeted by treatment, such as serotonin. In an 
      examination of 19 unmedicated OCD patients, 19 medicated OCD patients, 19 
      medicated patient controls without OCD, and 21 unmedicated healthy controls, we 
      found greater ERNs in OCD patients than in controls, irrespective of medication 
      use. Severity of generalized anxiety and depression was associated with ERN 
      amplitude in controls but not patients. These data confirm previous findings of 
      an exaggerated error response in OCD, further showing that it cannot be 
      attributed to medication. The absence in patients of a relationship between ERN 
      amplitude and anxiety/depression, as was found in controls, suggests that 
      elevated error signals in OCD may be disorder-specific.

TI  - Conformational dynamics of single pre-mRNA molecules during in vitro splicing.
PG  - 504-12
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.1767 [doi]
AB  - The spliceosome is a complex small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-protein machine that 
      removes introns from pre-mRNAs via two successive phosphoryl transfer reactions. 
      The chemical steps are isoenergetic, yet splicing requires at least eight 
      RNA-dependent ATPases responsible for substantial conformational rearrangements. 
      To comprehensively monitor pre-mRNA conformational dynamics, we developed a 
      strategy for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) that uses a small, efficiently spliced 
      yeast pre-mRNA, Ubc4, in which donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed in the 
      exons adjacent to the 5' and 3' splice sites. During splicing in vitro, we 
      observed a multitude of generally reversible time- and ATP-dependent 
      conformational transitions of individual pre-mRNAs. The conformational dynamics 
      of branchpoint and 3'-splice site mutants differ from one another and from wild 
      type. Because all transitions are reversible, spliceosome assembly appears to be 
      occurring close to thermal equilibrium.

TI  - Exploring posttraumatic stress disorder symptom profile among pregnant women.
PG  - 176-87
LID - 10.3109/0167482X.2010.486453 [doi]
AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in perinatal than general 
      samples of women (6-8% vs. 4-5%). To explore potential causes, we examined the 
      symptom profiles of women belonging to two separate samples: a perinatal clinic 
      sample (n = 1581) and a subsample of women in a similar age range from the U. S. 
      National Women's Study (NWS) (n = 2000). Within the perinatal sample, risk ratios 
      were higher for all 17 PTSD symptoms among women with current PTSD compared with 
      unaffected women, suggesting that higher rates are not likely due to measurement 
      error. The younger age and greater social disadvantage in the perinatal clinic 
      sample contributed only a small proportion of variance in symptom levels compared 
      with extent of trauma exposure and pre-existing PTSD. Compared with the national 
      study sample's symptom profile, the perinatal sample had higher rates of 
      occurrence of five symptoms: detachment, loss of interest, anger and 
      irritability, trouble sleeping, and nightmares. This analysis confirms that PTSD 
      rates are higher in perinatal samples, which is likely due to exacerbation of 
      pre-existing PTSD among women of a younger age and greater social disadvantage. 
      Further elucidation is warranted, including identifying triggers and determining 
      if there are needs for pregnancy-specific interventions.

AB  - The spliceosome is a complex small nuclear (sn)RNA-protein machine that removes 
      introns from pre-mRNAs via two successive phosphoryl transfer reactions. For each 
      splicing event, the spliceosome is assembled de novo on a pre-mRNA substrate and 
      a complex series of assembly steps leads to the active conformation. To 
      comprehensively monitor pre-mRNA conformational dynamics during spliceosome 
      assembly, we developed a strategy for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) that utilizes 
      a small, efficiently spliced yeast pre-mRNA, Ubc4, in which donor and acceptor 
      fluorophores are placed in the exons adjacent to the 5' and 3' splice sites. In 
      this chapter, we describe the identification of Ubc4 pre-mRNA that is efficiently 
      spliced in vitro and the methods we have developed for the chemical synthesis of 
      fluorescent Ubc4 pre-mRNA for smFRET.

      disordered structures.
PG  - 2311-7
LID - 10.1002/cphc.201000153 [doi]
AB  - The structures of many disordered materials are not ideally random, but contain 
      structural order on the scale of 1-3 nm. However, such nanoscale order, called 
      medium-range order, cannot be detected by conventional diffraction methods in 
      most cases. Fluctuation transmission electron microscopy (FTEM) has the 
      capability to detect medium-range order in disordered materials based on 
      statistical analysis of nanodiffraction patterns or dark-field images from TEM. 
      FTEM has been successful in demonstrating the theoretically predicted development 
      of nanoscale nuclei in amorphous chalcogenides, as well as in revealing the 
      subtle effect of different preparation routes on the medium-range order in 
      amorphous semiconductors and metals. The fluctuation principle can also be 
      applied to study structural order on longer length scales in polymers and other 
      disordered materials using X-rays or visible light. Further advances in theory 
      and practice of FTEM will greatly increase our understanding of amorphous 
      structures and nucleation phenomena.

TI  - Relationship between respiratory, endocrine, and cognitive-emotional factors in 
      response to a pharmacological panicogen.
PG  - 1011-6
LID - 10.1002/da.20725 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The cholecystokinin agonist pentagastrin has been used to study panic 
      attacks in the laboratory and to investigate hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis 
      activity. Its mechanism of panicogenesis remains unclear. Data from other models 
      suggest that respiratory stimulation itself may induce panic, but pentagastrin's 
      effects on respiration are not well established. Data from another model also 
      suggest links between respiratory and HPA axis reactivity and cognitive 
      modulation of both. To further explore these phenomena, we added respiratory 
      measures to a study of cognitive modulation of HPA and anxiety responses to 
      pentagastrin. METHODS: Healthy subjects received pentagastrin and placebo 
      injections, with measurement of cortisol and subjective responses, on two 
      different laboratory visits. They were randomly assigned to receive standard 
      instructions or one of two versions of previously studied cognitive interventions 
      (to either facilitate coping or increase sense of control), given before each 
      visit. Capnograph measures of heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and 
      end-tidal pCO(2) were obtained on 24 subjects. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, 
      pentagastrin induced a significant decline in pCO(2) with no change in RR. 
      Cortisol and HR increased, as expected. Cognitive intervention reduced the 
      hyperventilatory response to pentagastrin. CONCLUSIONS: Pentagastrin stimulates 
      respiration, likely via increases in tidal volume. Respiratory stimulation could 
      play a role in its panicogenic potency, though perhaps indirectly. As with HPA 
      axis responses, higher-level brain processes may be capable of modulating 
      pentagastrin-induced hyperventilation. This model may be useful for further study 
      of cortical/cognitive control of interacting emotional, respiratory, and 
      neuroendocrine sensitivities, with potential relevance to panic pathophysiology.

PG  - 59-69
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to: (1) conceptualize effective community engagement 
      (CE) within the Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) of Ontario, Canada, (2) 
      develop an effective CE framework and (3) compare the CE framework to public 
      engagement (PE) frameworks and assess their relevance to the LHIN context. 
      METHODS: We implemented "concept mapping," a participatory, mixed-methods 
      approach, with LHIN staff. The method includes three components: (1) 
      "Brainstorming" where participants generated statements describing effective CE; 
      (2) "Sorting and Rating" where participants grouped statements and rated their 
      relative importance to generate a "cluster map" and (3) "Mapping" where 
      participants reviewed and named the clusters to yield the effective CE framework. 
      RESULTS: Staff generated a list of 64 statements. Participants reviewed the 
      cluster map to generate six categories for the framework: (1) collaboration, (2) 
      accessibility, (3) accountability, (4) education, (5) principles and (6) 
      organizational capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The effective CE framework overlaps with PE 
      frameworks with two caveats. First, applications of PE evaluation frameworks to 
      the LHINs may yield incomplete results given that partnerships with service 
      providers and organizations are integral to CE strategies. Second, 
      "organizational capacity," largely not captured within existing frameworks, must 
      be integrated as a feature given that emerging research identifies its importance 
      to the successful implementation of engagement strategies.

AB  - Sub-5 nm metallic hafnium diboride (HfB(2)) nanostructures were directly written 
      onto Si(100)-2 x 1:H surfaces using ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling 
      microscope (UHV-STM) electron beam induced deposition (EBID) of a carbon-free 
      precursor molecule, tetrakis(tetrahydroborato)hafnium, Hf(BH(4))(4). Scanning 
      tunneling spectroscopy data confirm the metallic nature of the HfB(2) 
      nanostructures, which have been written down to lateral dimensions of  approximately 2.5 nm. To 
      our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of sub-5 nm metallic 
      nanostructures in an STM-EBID experiment.

TI  - The integration of citizens into a science/policy network in genetics: governance 
      arrangements and asymmetry in expertise.
PG  - 261-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00636.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE While there are increasing calls for public input into health research 
      and policy, the actual obtaining of such input faces many challenges in practice. 
      This article examines how a Canadian science/policy network in the field of 
      genetics integrated citizens into its structure and then managed their 
      participation. METHODS Our ethnographic case study covers a 5-year period 
      (2003-08) and combines four data sources: observations of the network's meetings 
      and informal activities, debriefing sessions with the network's leaders, 
      semi-structured interviews with network members (n = 20) and document analysis. 
      RESULTS When setting up the network, the leaders wanted to include a range of 
      perspectives (research, clinical and policy) to increase the relevance of their 
      research production and knowledge-transfer activities. After 2 years of 
      operation, the network's members agreed to also include citizens who were not 
      knowledgeable in genetics and policy issues. As neither the structure nor the 
      dynamics of the network were modified, the citizens very soon started to feel 
      uncomfortable with their role. They doubted the relevance of their contribution, 
      pointing to an asymmetry in knowledge between them and the expert members. There 
      were significant tensions in the network's governance and the citizens' concerns 
      during the process were not fully addressed. CONCLUSION The integration of 
      citizens into transdisciplinary networks requires recognizing and addressing the 
      asymmetry of expertise that underpins such a collaborative endeavour. It also 
      requires understanding that citizens may feel uncomfortable adopting the 
      pre-defined role ascribed to them, may need a space of their own or may even 
      withdraw if they feel being used.

TI  - Hyperactive error responses and altered connectivity in ventromedial and 
      frontoinsular cortices in obsessive-compulsive disorder.
PG  - 583-91
LID - 10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.09.048 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) show abnormal 
      functioning in ventral frontal brain regions involved in emotional/motivational 
      processes, including anterior insula/frontal operculum (aI/fO) and ventromedial 
      frontal cortex (VMPFC). While OCD has been associated with an increased neural 
      response to errors, the influence of motivational factors on this effect remains 
      poorly understood. METHODS: To investigate the contribution of motivational 
      factors to error processing in OCD and to examine functional connectivity between 
      regions involved in the error response, functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      data were measured in 39 OCD patients (20 unmedicated, 19 medicated) and 38 
      control subjects (20 unmedicated, 18 medicated) during an error-eliciting 
      interference task where motivational context was varied using monetary incentives 
      (null, loss, and gain). RESULTS: Across all errors, OCD patients showed reduced 
      deactivation of VMPFC and greater activation in left aI/FO compared with control 
      subjects. For errors specifically resulting in a loss, patients further 
      hyperactivated VMPFC, as well as right aI/FO. Independent of activity associated 
      with task events, OCD patients showed greater functional connectivity between 
      VMPFC and regions of bilateral aI/FO and right thalamus. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder patients show greater activation in neural regions 
      associated with emotion and valuation when making errors, which could be related 
      to altered intrinsic functional connectivity between brain networks. These 
      results highlight the importance of emotional/motivational responses to mistakes 
      in OCD and point to the need for further study of network interactions in the 
      disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study explores the factors that enhance or reduce the prospects 
      for public involvement in the activities of health technology assessment (HTA) 
      agencies. METHODS: The analytical framework for this study is based on the work 
      of John W. Kingdon, which provides a comprehensive synthesis of the factors 
      influencing governments and public organizations' agenda. The study draws 
      insights from forty-two semistructured telephone interviews with informants 
      involved in international HTA networks and/or in HTA agencies in Canada, Denmark, 
      and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: This exploratory study suggests that the HTA 
      community is moving toward greater public involvement. However, the HTA community 
      remains cautious and ambivalent about the technical feasibility of public 
      involvement, its acceptability to policy makers and practitioners, and its 
      impacts on HTA agencies' resources and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      stresses the importance of conducting rigorous and compelling evaluations to 
      inform HTA agencies' decision to adopt, or reject, public involvement practices.

TI  - Trait anxiety modulates anterior cingulate activation to threat interference.
PG  - 194-201
LID - 10.1002/da.20802 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individuals vary in the degree to which salient threatening stimuli 
      disrupt or distract from goal-directed cognitive processes. Excessive attention 
      to threat or difficulty resolving the interference created by threat cues could 
      contribute to anxious psychopathology; disruptions in frontal brain regions 
      implicated in attentional control or resolution of emotional interference (e.g. 
      anterior cingulate cortex, "ACC") might play a role. In this study, we explored 
      the hypothesis that trait anxiety would be associated with ACC activity in an 
      attentional control task with varying levels of threat interference. METHODS: 
      During functional magnetic resonance imaging, 20 healthy individuals who varied 
      in trait anxiety levels viewed angry, fearful, and neutral faces superimposed on 
      an indoor or outdoor scene. In a high-threat interference condition, subjects 
      identified the gender of the face (Attend Face). In a low-threat interference 
      condition, they identified the scene type (Attend Scene). Whole-brain analysis 
      was used to compare Attend Face with Attend Scene for angry and fearful (versus 
      neutral) faces. Contrasts were correlated with trait anxiety level. RESULTS: 
      Behavioral data confirmed that Attend Face produced greater threat interference 
      than Attend Scene. Brain imaging results showed that trait anxiety was inversely 
      associated with bilateral rostral ACC activity for Attend Face relative to Attend 
      Scene for angry faces. A similar relationship was not seen for fearful faces. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The rostral ACC is implicated in assessing the salience of emotional 
      information and controlling attention to resolve emotional interference. The link 
      between higher trait anxiety and decreased ACC activation for angry faces 
      suggests reduced attentional control for signals of interpersonal threat in 
      healthy anxiety-prone individuals.

TI  - Advanced practice nursing in Canada: overview of a decision support synthesis.
PG  - 15-34
AB  - The objective of this decision support synthesis was to identify and review 
      published and grey literature and to conduct stakeholder interviews to (1) 
      describe the distinguishing characteristics of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) 
      and nurse practitioner (NP) role definitions and competencies relevant to 
      Canadian contexts, (2) identify the key barriers and facilitators for the 
      effective development and utilization of CNS and NP roles and (3) inform the 
      development of evidence-based recommendations for the individual, organizational 
      and system supports required to better integrate CNS and NP roles into the 
      Canadian healthcare system and advance the delivery of nursing and patient care 
      services in Canada. Four types of advanced practice nurses (APNs) were the focus: 
      CNSs, primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), acute care nurse 
      practitioners (ACNPs) and a blended CNS/NP role. We worked with a 
      multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional advisory board that helped identify 
      documents and key informant interviewees, develop interview questions and 
      formulate implications from our findings. We included 468 published and 
      unpublished English- and French-language papers in a scoping review of the 
      literature. We conducted interviews in English and French with 62 Canadian and 
      international key informants (APNs, healthcare administrators, policy makers, 
      nursing regulators, educators, physicians and other team members). We conducted 
      four focus groups with a total of 19 APNs, educators, administrators and policy 
      makers. A multidisciplinary roundtable convened by the Canadian Health Services 
      Research Foundation formulated evidence-informed policy and practice 
      recommendations based on the synthesis findings. This paper forms the foundation 
      for this special issue, which contains 10 papers summarizing different dimensions 
      of our synthesis. Here, we summarize the synthesis methods and the 
      recommendations formulated at the roundtable.

TI  - Factors enabling advanced practice nursing role integration in Canada.
PG  - 211-38
AB  - Although advanced practice nurses (APNs) have existed in Canada for over 40 years 
      and there is abundant evidence of their safety and effectiveness, their full 
      integration into our healthcare system has not been fully realized. For this 
      paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the Canadian 
      literature from 1990 onward and interviews or focus groups with 81 key informants 
      conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to 
      identify the factors that enable role development and implementation across the 
      three types of APNs: clinical nurse specialists, primary healthcare nurse 
      practitioners and acute care nurse practitioners. For development of advanced 
      practice nursing roles, many of the enabling factors occur at the 
      federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) level. They include utilization of a 
      pan-Canadian approach, provision of high-quality education, and development of 
      appropriate legislative and regulatory mechanisms. Systematic planning to guide 
      role development is needed at both the F/P/T and organizational levels. For 
      implementation of advanced practice nursing roles, some of the enabling factors 
      require action at the F/P/T level. They include recruitment and retention, role 
      funding, intra-professional relations between clinical nurse specialists and 
      nurse practitioners, public awareness, national leadership support and role 
      evaluation. Factors requiring action at the level of the organization include 
      role clarity, healthcare setting support, implementation of all role components 
      and continuing education. Finally, inter-professional relations require action at 
      both the F/P/T and organizational levels. A multidisciplinary roundtable 
      formulated policy and practice recommendations based on the synthesis findings, 
      and these are summarized in this paper.

TI  - Utilization of nurse practitioners to increase patient access to primary 
      healthcare in Canada--thinking outside the box.
PG  - 239-59
AB  - In the past decade, all Canadian provinces and territories have launched various 
      team-based primary healthcare initiatives designed to improve access and 
      continuity of care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly becoming integral 
      members of primary healthcare teams across the country. This paper draws on the 
      results of a scoping review of the literature and qualitative key informant 
      interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis about advanced practice 
      nursing in Canada. We describe and analyze two novel approaches to NP integration 
      designed to address the gap in patient access to primary healthcare: (1) the 
      integration of NPs in traditional fee-for-service practices in British Columbia, 
      and (2) the creation of NP-led clinics in Ontario. Although fee-for-service 
      remuneration has been a barrier to collaborative practice, the integration of 
      government-salaried NPs into fee-for-service practices in British Columbia has 
      enabled the creation of inter-professional teams, and based on early evaluation 
      findings, has increased patient access to care and patient and provider 
      satisfaction. NP-led clinics are designed to provide inter-professional care in 
      communities with high numbers of patients who do not have a regular primary 
      healthcare provider. Given the shortage of physicians in communities where these 
      clinics are being introduced, the ratio of physicians to NPs is lower than in 
      other primary healthcare delivery models, and physicians function in more of a 
      consulting role. Initial evaluation of the first of 26 NP-led clinics indicates 
      increased access to care and high levels of patient and provider satisfaction. 
      Implementing a creative mosaic of collaborative primary healthcare models that 
      are responsive to patient needs challenges traditional assumptions about 
      professional roles and responsibilities. To address this challenge, we endorse a 
      recommendation that governments establish a mechanism to bring together both 
      physician and non-physician primary healthcare providers to advise on primary 
      healthcare policy development and implementation.

TI  - Eliciting ethical and social values in health technology assessment: A 
      participatory approach.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Despite a growing consensus that ethical and social values should be addressed in 
      health technology assessment (HTA) processes, there exist a variety of methods 
      for doing so. There is growing interest in involving citizens in policy 
      development to ensure that decisions are legitimate, and reflect the broad social 
      values of the public. We sought to bring these issues together by employing a 
      participatory approach to elicit ethical and social values in HTA. Our primary 
      objective was to elicit a set of ethical and social values from citizens that 
      could be used to guide Ontario's HTA evidentiary review and appraisal process. A 
      secondary objective was to explore the feasibility of using participatory 
      approaches to elicit these values. A 14-person Citizens' Reference Panel on 
      Health Technologies was established to provide input to the Ontario Health 
      Technology Advisory Committee in developing its recommendations. A mixed methods 
      approach was used where informed, deliberative discussions were combined with 
      pre- and post-questionnaires, which assessed the relative importance of various 
      ethical and social values as well as their stability over time. Over the course 
      of five meetings, panel members progressed toward the identification of a set of 
      core values -universal access, choice and quality care. These values were 
      consistently prioritized as the core values that should be considered in the 
      evaluation of health technologies and ensuing recommendations. Sustained and 
      deliberative methods, like a citizens' panel, offer a promising approach for 
      eliciting ethical and social values into HTA.

TI  - Ecological salivary cortisol analysis-- part 2: relative impact of trauma 
      history, posttraumatic stress, comorbidity, chronic stress, and known confounds 
      on hormone levels.
PG  - 285-96
LID - 10.1177/1078390308321939 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bio-psycho-social health research is an ideal, samples 
      adequate for complex modeling require biomarker specimens from hundreds of 
      participants. Ecological sampling departs from laboratory study norms, with 
      implications for analysis. OBJECTIVE: To inform ecological study designs, this 
      article compares salivary cortisol levels and effect sizes of "focal" psychiatric 
      factors, such as trauma history, posttraumatic stress diagnosis, comorbidity, and 
      chronic stress, and "nuisance" factors, including endocrine disorders and 
      medications and physiological factors such as gestational age and smoking. STUDY 
      DESIGN: This is a descriptive analysis of ecologically collected cortisol 
      specimens, assayed in an ongoing perinatal psychobiological study, addressing 
      methodological considerations. RESULTS: Focal and nuisance factors are often 
      interdependent with similar effect sizes. Careful specimen deletion decisions and 
      model specification are needed to achieve the hoped-for external validity while 
      maintaining internal validity. CONCLUSIONS: Results of multivariate models lend 
      support to the validity and usefulness of an ecological approach to incorporating 
      biomarkers in health research. J Am Psychiatr Nurses Assoc, 2008; 14(4), 285-296.

TI  - Beyond anxious predisposition: do padecer de nervios and ataque de nervios add 
      incremental validity to predictions of current distress among Mexican mothers?
PG  - 23-31
LID - 10.1002/da.20855 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nervios (PNRV) and ataque de nervios (ATQ) are culture-bound 
      syndromes with overlapping symptoms of anxiety, depression, and dissociation, 
      shown to have inconsistent associations to psychiatric disorder. Few studies test 
      the basic assumption that PNRV and ATQ are uniformly linked to distress outcomes 
      across Latina/o immigrant groups. This study examined: (a) the extent to which 
      acculturative stress, Latino/US American acculturation, and anxious 
      predisposition were associated with lifetime history of ATQ and PNRV, and (b) the 
      extent to which ATQ and PNRV add incremental validity in explaining acculturative 
      stress and psychological distress beyond measures of anxious predisposition. 
      METHOD: Participants (n = 82) included Mexican mothers who completed surveys on 
      acculturation, trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, lifetime ATQ/PNRV, 
      psychological distress, and acculturative stress. RESULTS: Lifetime PNRV, but not 
      lifetime ATQ, was significantly predictive of psychological distress. PNRV was 
      also linked to trait anxiety. Psychometric measures of anxious predisposition 
      (trait anxiety and anxiety sensitivity) were more robust predictors of distress 
      outcomes than lifetime history of ATQ/PNRV. CONCLUSION: Inquiry into lifetime 
      history of nervios may be a useful point of entry in talking to Mexican immigrant 
      mothers about stress and distress. However, standard tools for assessing anxiety 
      sensitivity and trait anxiety appear most useful in identifying and explaining 
      the presence of psychological distress. Further research is needed to determine 
      the cross-cultural relevance of trait anxiety and anxiety sensitivity, and its 
      implications for the development of anxiety treatments that are effective across 
      cultures.

      pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 1119-29
LID - 10.1002/cncr.26365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic 
      cancer but at an increased cost. In this study, the authors evaluated the 
      cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of locally 
      advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was 
      constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment regimens: 
      gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy, gemcitabine plus 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); and gemcitabine with stereotactic body 
      radiotherapy (SBRT). Patients transitioned between the following 5 health states: 
      stable disease, local progression, distant failure, local and distant failure, 
      and death. Health utility tolls were assessed for radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
      treatments and for radiation toxicity. RESULTS: SBRT increased life expectancy by 
      0.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an increased cost of $13,700 compared 
      with gemcitabine alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $69,500 per 
      QALY). SBRT was more effective and less costly than conventional radiotherapy and 
      IMRT. An analysis that excluded SBRT demonstrated that conventional radiotherapy 
      had an ICER of $126,800 per QALY compared with gemcitabine alone, and IMRT had an 
      ICER of $1,584,100 per QALY compared with conventional radiotherapy. A 
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of 
      cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY was 78% for 
      gemcitabine alone, 21% for SBRT, 1.4% for conventional radiotherapy, and 0.01% 
      for IMRT. At a willingness to pay of $200,000 per QALY, the probability of 
      cost-effectiveness was 73% for SBRT, 20% for conventional radiotherapy, 7% for 
      gemcitabine alone, and 0.7% for IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated 
      that IMRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer exceeds what society considers 
      cost-effective. In contrast, combining gemcitabine with SBRT increased clinical 
      effectiveness beyond that of gemcitabine alone at a cost potentially acceptable 
      by today's standards.

      obsessive-compulsive disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by 
      abnormalities of frontal-striatal-thalamic circuitry that appear near illness 
      onset and persist over its course. Distinct frontal-striatal-thalamic loops 
      through cortical centers for cognitive control (anterior cingulate cortex) and 
      emotion processing (ventral medial frontal cortex) follow unique maturational 
      trajectories, and altered connectivity within distinct loops may be 
      differentially associated with OCD at specific stages of development. METHOD: 
      Altered development of striatal and thalamic connectivity to medial frontal 
      cortex was tested in 60 OCD patients compared with 61 healthy control subjects at 
      child, adolescent, and adult stages of development, using resting-state 
      functional connectivity MRI. RESULTS: OCD in the youngest patients was associated 
      with reduced connectivity of dorsal striatum and medial dorsal thalamus to 
      rostral and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, respectively. Increased 
      connectivity of dorsal striatum to ventral medial frontal cortex was observed in 
      patients at all developmental stages. In child patients, reduced connectivity 
      between dorsal striatum and rostral anterior cingulate cortex correlated with OCD 
      severity. CONCLUSIONS: Frontal-striatal-thalamic loops involved in cognitive 
      control are hypoconnected in young patients near illness onset, whereas loops 
      implicated in emotion processing are hyperconnected throughout the illness.

TI  - Intensity-modulated radiotherapy for tumors of the nasal cavity and paranasal 
      sinuses: clinical outcomes and patterns of failure.
PG  - 243-51
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.05.044 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report outcomes in patients treated with intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumors of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity 
      (PNS/NC). METHODS/MATERIALS: Between June 2000 and December 2009, 52 patients 
      with tumors of the PNS/NC underwent postoperative or definitive radiation with 
      IMRT. Twenty-eight (54%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Twenty-nine 
      patients (56%) received chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 26.6 months 
      (range, 2.9-118.4) for all patients and 30.9 months for living patients. RESULTS: 
      Eighteen patients (35%) developed local-regional failure (LRF) at median time of 
      7.2 months. Thirteen local failures (25%) were observed, 12 in-field and 1 
      marginal. Six regional failures were observed, two in-field and four 
      out-of-field. No patients treated with elective nodal radiation had nodal 
      regional failure. Two-year local-regional control (LRC), in-field LRC, freedom 
      from distant metastasis (FFDM), and overall survival (OS) were 64%, 74%, 71%, and 
      66% among all patients, respectively, and 43%, 61%, 61%, and 53% among patients 
      with SCC, respectively. On multivariate analysis, SCC and >1 subsite involved had 
      worse LRC (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.046, respectively) and OS (p = 0.003 and p = 
      0.046, respectively). Cribriform plate invasion (p = 0.005) and residual disease 
      (p = 0.047) also had worse LRC. Acute toxicities included Grade >/=3 mucositis in 
      19 patients (37%), and Grade 3 dermatitis in 8 patients (15%). Six patients had 
      Grade >/=3 late toxicity including one optic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT for 
      patients with PNS/NC tumors has good outcomes compared with historical series and 
      is well tolerated. Patients with SCC have worse LRC and OS. LRF is the 
      predominant pattern of failure.

PG  - 623-9

AB  - Dose-volume parameters are needed to guide the safe administration of 
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). We report on esophageal tolerance to 
      high-dose hypofractionated radiation in patients treated with SABR. Thirty-one 
      patients with spine or lung tumors received single- or multiple-fraction SABR to 
      targets less than 1 cm from the esophagus. End points evaluated include D(5cc) 
      (minimum dose in Gy to 5 cm(3) of the esophagus receiving the highest dose), 
      D(2cc) , D(1cc) , and D(max) (maximum dose to 0.01 cm(3) ). Multiple-fraction 
      treatments were correlated using the linear quadratic and linear 
      quadratic-linear/universal survival models. Three esophageal toxicity events 
      occurred, including esophagitis (grade 2), tracheoesophageal fistula (grade 4-5), 
      and esophageal perforation (grade 4-5). Chemotherapy was a cofactor in the 
      high-grade events. The median time to development of esophageal toxicity was 4.1 
      months (range 0.6-6.1 months). Two of the three events occurred below a published 
      D(5cc) threshold, all three were below a D(2cc) threshold, and one was below a 
      D(max) threshold. We report a dosimetric analysis of incidental dose to the 
      esophagus from SABR. High-dose hypofractionated radiotherapy led to a number of 
      high-grade esophageal adverse events, suggesting that conservative parameters to 
      protect the esophagus are necessary when SABR is used, especially in the setting 
      of chemotherapy or prior radiotherapy.

LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.09.035 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report the outcomes and toxicities in patients treated with 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. METHODS 
      AND MATERIALS: Forty-seven patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma were treated 
      with IMRT between 2003 and 2008. Of these 47 patients, 29 were treated adjuvantly 
      and 18 definitively. All received concurrent 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. The 
      treatment plans were optimized such that 95% of the planning target volume 
      received the prescription dose. The median delivered dose for the adjuvant and 
      definitive patients was 50.4 and 54.0 Gy, respectively. RESULTS: The median age 
      at diagnosis was 63.9 years. For adjuvant patients, the 1- and 2-year overall 
      survival rate was 79% and 40%, respectively. The 1- and 2-year recurrence-free 
      survival rate was 58% and 17%, respectively. The local-regional control rate at 1 
      and 2 years was 92% and 80%, respectively. For definitive patients, the 1-year 
      overall survival, recurrence-free survival, and local-regional control rate was 
      24%, 16%, and 64%, respectively. Four patients developed Grade 3 or greater acute 
      toxicity (9%) and four developed Grade 3 late toxicity (9%). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Survival for patients with pancreatic cancer remains poor. A small percentage of 
      adjuvant patients have durable disease control, and with improved therapies, this 
      proportion will increase. Systemic therapy offers the greatest opportunity. The 
      present results have demonstrated that IMRT is well tolerated. Compared with 
      those who received three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy in previously 
      reported prospective clinical trials, patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
      treated with IMRT in our series had improved acute toxicity.

TI  - Unconditioned freezing is enhanced in an appetitive context: implications for the 
      contextual dependency of unconditioned fear.
PG  - 386-92
LID - 10.1016/j.nlm.2012.03.002 [doi]
AB  - It has been well established that expression of conditioned fear is context 
      independent, but the context dependency of unconditioned fear expression has 
      rarely been explored. A recent study reported that unconditioned freezing in rats 
      is enhanced in a familiar context, which suggests that unconditioned fear 
      expression can be modulated by contextual processing. In order to further explore 
      this possibility we examined unconditioned freezing in novel, familiar, and 
      appetitive contexts; and attempted to identify brain regions critical for 
      context-related changes in unconditioned freezing by measuring c-Fos mRNA levels 
      in emotional circuits. Unconditioned freezing was enhanced in the appetitive 
      context, and this enhancement was accompanied by increased c-Fos mRNA expression 
      in the medial amygdala and hippocampus, but attenuated expression in the medial 
      prefrontal cortex. In the appetitive context, expectation of a reward coupled 
      with detection of threat may have enhanced unconditioned fear expression, which 
      suggests that unconditioned fear expression can be modulated by contextual 
      factors. Context-related expectancy mismatch may explain the enhancement of 
      unconditioned fear expression seen in this study and warrants further 
      examination.

TI  - Subjective uncertainty and limbic hyperactivation in obsessive-compulsive 
      disorder.
PG  - 1956-70
LID - 10.1002/hbm.22038 [doi]
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is often associated with pathological 
      uncertainty regarding whether an action has been performed correctly or whether a 
      bad outcome will occur, leading to compulsive "evidence gathering" behaviors 
      aimed at reducing uncertainty. The current study used event-related functional 
      magnetic resonance imaging to investigate neural functioning in OCD patients and 
      controls as subjective certainty was rated in response to sequential pieces of 
      evidence for a decision. Uncertainty was experimentally manipulated so that some 
      decisions were associated with no "objective" uncertainty (all observed evidence 
      pointed to one correct choice), whereas other decisions contained calculable but 
      varying levels of objective uncertainty based on displayed probabilities. Results 
      indicated that OCD patients differed from controls on decisions that contained no 
      objective uncertainty, such that patients rated themselves as more uncertain. 
      Patients also showed greater activation in a network of brain regions previously 
      associated with internally-focused thought and valuation including ventromedial 
      prefrontal cortex, parahippocampus, middle temporal cortex, as well as amygdala 
      and orbitofrontal cortex/ventral anterior insula. In the patient group, a 
      significantly greater number of positive intersubject correlations were found 
      among several of these brain regions, suggesting that this network is more 
      interconnected in patients. OCD patients did not differ from controls on 
      decisions where task parameters led to uncertainty. These results indicate that 
      OCD is associated with hyperactivation in a network of limbic/paralimbic brain 
      regions when making decisions, which may contribute to the greater subjective 
      experience of doubt that characterizes the disorder.

TI  - The unbearable lightness of citizens within public deliberation processes.
PG  - 1843-50
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.023 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing literature examining the involvement of citizens in health 
      policymaking. While determining what form such involvement should take and who 
      should participate is of particular interest to policymakers and researchers, the 
      current ontological understanding of what a citizen is suffers from "lightness." 
      This essay thus seeks to provide more depth by shedding light on the ways in 
      which individuals define what "being" a citizen means for them and choose to 
      embody or not such a role. Inspired by a four-year ethnographic study of a 
      Canadian science/policy network in genetics, which integrated citizens into its 
      operation, this paper provides four biographical sketches that portray the 
      complexity and richness of what these individuals were "made of." We reflect on 
      how they sought to make sense of their participation in the network by drawing on 
      a repertoire of cultural, relational and cognitive resources and on their lived 
      experience. Their capacity to "be" a participant and to be acknowledged as such 
      by the others was shaped by their values and interests and by the contributions 
      they sought to realise throughout their participation. Our discussion suggests 
      that the quest for the "ordinary" citizen is misleading. Instead, acknowledging 
      the sociological concreteness of citizenship and understanding how it may be 
      embodied and exercised should be a key focus in public involvement theory and 
      practice in health care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by an excessive 
      focus on upsetting or disturbing thoughts, feelings, and images that are 
      internally-generated. Internally-focused thought processes are subserved by the 
      "default mode network" (DMN), which has been found to be hyperactive in OCD 
      during cognitive tasks. In healthy individuals, disengagement from 
      internally-focused thought processes may rely on interactions between DMN and a 
      fronto-parietal network (FPN) associated with external attention and task 
      execution. Altered connectivity between FPN and DMN may contribute to the 
      dysfunctional behavior and brain activity found in OCD. METHODS: The current 
      study examined interactions between FPN and DMN during rest in 30 patients with 
      OCD (17 unmedicated) and 32 control subjects (17 unmedicated). Timecourses from 
      seven fronto-parietal seeds were correlated across the whole brain and compared 
      between groups. RESULTS: OCD patients exhibited altered connectivity between FPN 
      seeds (primarily anterior insula) and several regions of DMN including posterior 
      cingulate cortex, medial frontal cortex, posterior inferior parietal lobule, and 
      parahippocampus. These differences were driven largely by a reduction of negative 
      correlations among patients compared to controls. Patients also showed greater 
      positive connectivity between FPN and regions outside DMN, including thalamus, 
      lateral frontal cortex, and somatosensory/motor regions. CONCLUSIONS: OCD is 
      associated with abnormal intrinsic functional connectivity between large-scale 
      brain networks. Alteration of interactions between FPN and DMN at rest may 
      contribute to aspects of the OCD phenotype, such as patients' inability to 
      disengage from internally-generated scenarios and thoughts when performing 
      everyday tasks requiring external attention.

TI  - Analyzing the influence of institutions on health policy development in Uganda: a 
      case study of the decision to abolish user fees.
PG  - 578-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 2001 election campaign, President Yoweri Museveni 
      announced he was abolishing user fees for health services in Uganda. No analysis 
      has been carried out to explain how he was able to initiate such an important 
      policy decision without encountering any immediate barriers. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain this outcome through in-depth policy analysis driven by the application 
      of key analytical frameworks. METHODS: An explanatory case study informed by 
      analytical frameworks from the institutionalism literature was undertaken. 
      Multiple data sources were used including: academic literature, key government 
      documents, grey literature, and a variety of print media. RESULTS: According to 
      the analytical frameworks employed, several formal institutional constraints 
      existed that would have reduced the prospects for the abolition of user fees. 
      However, prevalent informal institutions such as "Big Man" presidentialism and 
      clientelism that were both 'competing' and 'complementary' can be used to explain 
      the policy outcome. The analysis suggests that these factors trumped the impact 
      of more formal institutional structures in the Ugandan context. CONCLUSION: 
      Consideration should be given to the interactions between formal and informal 
      institutions in the analysis of health policy processes in Uganda, as they 
      provide a more nuanced understanding of how each set of factors influence policy 
      outcomes.

TI  - Symptom Dimensions in Two Samples of Africans Americans with Obsessive-Compulsive 
      Disorder.
PG  - 145-152
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, 
      however, there is a lack of research that includes African Americans, thus it is 
      unclear whether findings about symptom dimensions can be generalized to this 
      population. A sample of adult African Americans with OCD (N=74) was recruited at 
      the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and administered the Yale Brown 
      Obsessive-Compulsive checklist (YBOCS) to better understand the phenomenology of 
      OCD in African Americans. Frequencies of symptoms are reported and compared to 
      findings from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL; N=54). A principal 
      components analysis of YBOCS categories and items was performed on the Penn 
      sample. A six-component solution was found, that included Contamination & 
      Washing, Hoarding, Sexual Obsessions & Reassurance, Aggression & Mental 
      Compulsions, Symmetry & Perfectionism, and Doubt & Checking, explaining 59.1% of 
      the variance. Factors identified were similar to those of previous studies in 
      primarily white samples. African Americans with OCD reported more contamination 
      symptoms and were twice as likely to report excessive concerns with animals as 
      European Americans with OCD. The results indicate the presence of cultural 
      differences, which is consistent with findings among non-clinical samples. 
      Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Fabrication of ultrasharp probes is of interest for many applications, including 
      scanning probe microscopy and electron-stimulated patterning of surfaces. These 
      techniques require reproducible ultrasharp metallic tips, yet the efficient and 
      reproducible fabrication of these consumable items has remained an elusive goal. 
      Here we describe a novel biased-probe field-directed sputter sharpening technique 
      applicable to conductive materials, which produces nanometer and sub-nanometer 
      sharp W, Pt-Ir and W-HfB(2) tips able to perform atomic-scale lithography on Si. 
      Compared with traditional probes fabricated by etching or conventional sputter 
      erosion, field-directed sputter sharpened probes have smaller radii and produce 
      lithographic patterns 18-26% sharper with atomic-scale lithographic fidelity.

AB  - A first-line approach to treat anxiety disorders is exposure-based therapy, which 
      relies on extinction processes such as repeatedly exposing the patient to stimuli 
      (conditioned stimuli; CS) associated with the traumatic, fear-related memory. 
      However, a significant number of patients fail to maintain their gains, partly 
      attributed to the fact that this inhibitory learning and its maintenance is 
      temporary and conditioned fear responses can return. Animal studies have shown 
      that activation of the cannabinoid system during extinction learning enhances 
      fear extinction and its retention. Specifically, CB1 receptor agonists, such as 
      Delta9-tetrahydrocannibinol (THC), can facilitate extinction recall by preventing 
      recovery of extinguished fear in rats. However, this phenomenon has not been 
      investigated in humans. We conducted a study using a randomized, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled, between-subjects design, coupling a standard Pavlovian fear 
      extinction paradigm and simultaneous skin conductance response (SCR) recording 
      with an acute pharmacological challenge with oral dronabinol (synthetic THC) or 
      placebo (PBO) 2 h prior to extinction learning in 29 healthy adult volunteers 
      (THC = 14; PBO = 15) and tested extinction retention 24 h after extinction 
      learning. Compared to subjects that received PBO, subjects that received THC 
      showed low SCR to a previously extinguished CS when extinction memory recall was 
      tested 24 h after extinction learning, suggesting that THC prevented the recovery 
      of fear. These results provide the first evidence that pharmacological 
      enhancement of extinction learning is feasible in humans using cannabinoid system 
      modulators, which may thus warrant further development and clinical testing. This 
      article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.

AB  - Decision making (DM) in the context of others often entails complex 
      cognition-emotion interaction. While the literature suggests that the 
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), striatum, and amygdala are involved in 
      valuation-based DM and hippocampus in context processing, how these neural 
      mechanisms subserve the integration of cognitive and emotional values in a social 
      context remains unclear. In this study we addressed this gap by systematically 
      manipulating cognition-emotion interaction in a social DM context, when the 
      participants played a card game with a hypothetical opponent in a behavioral 
      study (n=73) and a functional magnetic-resonance-imaging study (n=16). We 
      observed that payoff-based behavioral choices were influenced by emotional values 
      carried by face pictures and identified neurocircuits involved in cognitive 
      valuation, emotional valuation, and concurrent cognition-emotion value 
      integration. Specifically, while the vmPFC, amygdala, and ventral striatum were 
      all involved in both cognitive and emotional domains of valuation, these regions 
      played dissociable roles in social DM. The payoff-dependent responses in vmPFC 
      and amygdala, but not ventral striatum, were moderated by the social context. 
      Furthermore, the vmPFC, but not amygdala, not only encoded the opponent's gains 
      as if self's losses, but also represented a "final common currency" during 
      valuation-based decisions. The extent to which emotional input influenced choices 
      was associated with the functional connectivity between the value-signaling 
      amygdala and value integrating vmPFC, and also with the functional connectivity 
      between the context-setting hippocampus and value-signaling amygdala and ventral 
      striatum. These results identify brain pathways through which emotion shapes 
      subjective values in a social DM context.

AB  - Models that describe the key features and intended effects of specific knowledge 
      translation and exchange (KTE) interventions are much less prominent than models 
      that provide a more general understanding of KTE. Our aim was to develop a model 
      in order to describe the key features and intended effects of deliberative 
      dialogues used as a KTE strategy and to understand how deliberative dialogues can 
      support evidence-informed policymaking. By using critical interpretive synthesis, 
      we identified 17 papers representing four fields of enquiry and integrated our 
      findings into a model. The key features described in the model are: 1) an 
      appropriate (i.e., conducive to the particular dialogue) meeting environment; 2) 
      an appropriate mix of participants; and, 3) an appropriate use of research 
      evidence. These features combine to create three types of intended effects: 1) 
      short-term individual-level; 3) medium-term community/organizational-level; and, 
      3) long-term system-level. The concept of capacity building helps to explain the 
      relationship between features and effects. The model is a useful contribution to 
      the KTE field because it is a practical tool that could be used to guide the 
      development and evaluation of deliberative dialogues in order to understand more 
      about achieving particular outcomes in relation to specific issues or contexts.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated co-morbidities, level of disability, 
      service utilization and demographic correlates of panic disorder (PD) among 
      African Americans, Caribbean blacks and non-Hispanic white Americans. METHODS: 
      Data are from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) and the National 
      Comorbidity Survey-Replication (NCS-R). RESULTS: Non-Hispanic whites are the most 
      likely to develop PD across the lifespan compared to the black subgroups. 
      Caribbean blacks were found to experience higher levels of functional impairment. 
      There were no gender differences found in prevalence of PD in Caribbean blacks, 
      indicating that existing knowledge about who is at risk for developing PD 
      (generally more prevalent in women) may not be true among this subpopulation. 
      Furthermore, Caribbean blacks with PD were least likely to use mental health 
      services compared to African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. CONCLUSION: This 
      study demonstrates that PD may affect black ethnic subgroups differently, which 
      has important implications for understanding the nature and etiology of the 
      disorder.

AB  - This study explores relationships between lifetime and 12-month DSM-IV major 
      depressive disorder and religious involvement within a nationally representative 
      sample of African American adults (n = 3,570). MDD was assessed using the DSM-IV 
      World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Multivariate 
      findings indicate that reading religious materials were positively associated 
      with 12-month (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.29) 
      and lifetime (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03-1.21) MDD, religious service attendance was 
      inversely associated with 12-month and lifetime MDD, and religious coping was 
      inversely associated with 12-month MDD (OR, 0.75, 95% CI, 0.57-0.99). Findings 
      are discussed in relation to the role of religion for African American mental 
      health, prior research on the effects of religious involvement on physical and 
      mental health, and theoretical and conceptual models of religion-health 
      connections that specify multiple and often divergent pathways (e.g., prevention 
      and resource mobilization) by which diverse forms of religious involvement impact 
      mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To test whether (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
      emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging metrics correlate with 
      outcomes in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with 
      stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-four 
      patients with stage I NSCLC underwent pre-SABR PET at simulation and/or post-SABR 
      PET within 6 months. We analyzed maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)) and 
      metabolic tumor volume defined using several thresholds (MTV50%, or MTV2, 4, 7, 
      and 10). Endpoints included primary tumor control (PTC), progression-free 
      survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). We 
      performed Kaplan-Meier, competing risk, and Cox proportional hazards survival 
      analyses. RESULTS: Patients received 25-60 Gy in 1 to 5 fractions. Median 
      follow-up time was 13.2 months. The 1-year estimated PTC, PFS, OS and CSS were 
      100, 83, 87 and 94%, respectively. Pre-treatment SUV(max) (p=0.014), MTV(7) 
      (p=0.0077), and MTV(10) (p=0.0039) correlated significantly with OS. In the 
      low-MTV(7)vs. high-MTV(7) sub-groups, 1-year estimated OS was 100 vs. 78% 
      (p=0.0077) and CSS was 100 vs. 88% (p=0.082). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      hypothesis-generating study we identified multiple pre-treatment PET-CT metrics 
      as potential predictors of OS and CSS in patients with NSCLC treated with SABR. 
      These could aid risk-stratification and treatment individualization if validated 
      prospectively.

TI  - The effect of dead-on-arrival and emergency department death classification on 
      risk-adjusted performance in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality 
      Improvement Program.
PG  - 1086-91; discussion 1091-2
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e31826fc7a0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement Program 
      is focused on identifying variations in outcomes across trauma centers for the 
      purposes of performance improvement. In previous analyses, patients who died in 
      the emergency department were excluded. We investigated the effect of inclusion 
      and exclusion of emergency department (ED) deaths (dead on arrival [DOA] and died 
      in ED [DIE]) on analyses of overall risk-adjusted trauma center performance. 
      METHODS: Data for patients admitted to 65 Trauma Quality Improvement Program 
      hospitals during the 2009 calendar year was used. A logistic regression model was 
      developed to estimate risk-adjusted mortality. Trauma centers were then ranked 
      based on their observed-to-expected (O/E) mortality ratio with 90% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) and classified by outlier status: low outliers/high performers 
      had a 90% CI for O/E mortality ratio of less than 1, and high outliers/low 
      performers had a 90% CI for O/E mortality ratio of greater than 1. Changes in 
      outlier status, rank, and quartile were examined with and without DOA and DIE 
      patients included in the analyses to discern the impact of such exclusions on 
      overall risk-adjusted center-specific performance. RESULTS: Thirty-one trauma 
      centers (48%) reported no DOA patients in 2009, while 6 centers (9%) reported 
      more than 10. Of 224 patients, 14 (6.2%) had a documented time of death of more 
      than 30 minutes after ED arrival despite being recorded as DOA. Forty-one trauma 
      centers (63%) changed rank by three positions or less. Ten trauma centers changed 
      their quartile ranking by a single quartile, but no centers were found to change 
      quartile rank more than one quartile. Changes in outlier status occurred for 6 
      trauma centers (9%). CONCLUSION: The relative frequency of patients classified as 
      DOA varies greatly between trauma centers. Misclassification of patients as DOA 
      occurs. Inclusion of ED deaths in risk-adjusted analysis of mortality results in 
      a small but insignificant change in predicting the outcome results of a trauma 
      center. This change is less than the rate of finding a center to be a high or low 
      outlier by chance alone using the 90% CI. Inclusion of DOA and DIE patients in 
      risk-adjusted analysis of mortality is appropriate and eliminates the bias 
      introduced by exclusion of ED deaths owing to misuse of the DOA classification. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic study, level III.

LID - 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.12.001 [doi]
AB  - Whereas respiratory psychophysiological research has mainly studied respiratory 
      time and volume, variability in these parameters has been largely disregarded, 
      even though it may provide important information about respiratory regulation. 
      The present paper reviews the literature on respiratory variability and 
      elaborates on the importance of assessing various components of respiratory 
      variability when studying the interrelationships between emotions and breathing. 
      A model is proposed that predicts specific action tendencies related to emotions 
      to disturb the balance between various respiratory variability components 
      depending on valence by arousal and control dimensions. The central focus of the 
      paper is sighing. The causes and consequences of sighing are reviewed and 
      integrated in the proposed model in which sighing is hypothesized to function as 
      a resetter in the regulation of both breathing and emotions, because it restores 
      a balance in respiratory variability fractions and causes relief.

TI  - Exogenous glucocorticoids decrease subgenual cingulate activity evoked by 
      sadness.
PG  - 826-45
LID - 10.1038/npp.2012.249 [doi]
AB  - The glucocorticoid hormone cortisol is known to have wide-ranging effects on a 
      variety of physiological systems, including the morphology and physiology of the 
      amygdala and hippocampus. Disruptions of cortisol regulation and signaling are 
      also linked with psychiatric disorders involving emotional disturbances. Although 
      there is much evidence to suggest a relationship between cortisol signaling and 
      the brain physiology underlying emotion, few studies have attempted to test for 
      direct effects of cortisol on the neurophysiology of emotion. We administered 
      exogenous synthetic cortisol (hydrocortisone, HCT) using two different dosing 
      regimens (25 mg/day over 4 days, 100 mg single dose), in a double-blind 
      placebo-controlled functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. During 
      fMRI scanning, healthy subjects viewed images designed to induce happy, sad, and 
      neutral emotional states. Subjective emotional reactions were collected for each 
      experimental stimulus after fMRI scanning. Mood ratings were also collected 
      throughout the 4 days of the study. Both dose regimens of HCT resulted in 
      decreased subgenual cingulate activation during sadness conditions. The 25 mg/day 
      regimen also resulted in higher arousal ratings of sad stimuli. No effects of HCT 
      were observed on any mood ratings. Few reliable effects of HCT were observed on 
      brain activity patterns or subjective emotional responses to stimuli that were 
      not sad. The inhibitory effects of cortisol on sadness-induced subgenual 
      cingulate activity may have critical relevance to the pathophysiology of major 
      depression, as both subgenual hyperactivity and decreased sensitivity to cortisol 
      signaling have been documented in patients with depression.

TI  - Major depressive disorder among older African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and 
      non-Hispanic whites: secondary analysis of the National Survey of American Life.
PG  - 589-97
LID - 10.1002/da.22041 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous epidemiological and clinical research on mental disorders 
      has treated Blacks as a homogenous group and yet Blacks of Caribbean descent and 
      African Americans differ with respect to ethnicity, national heritage, living 
      circumstances, and immigration status. The purpose of this article is to examine 
      the prevalence of major depressive disorder (MDD) among African Americans, 
      Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic whites aged 50 and older with data on 
      psychiatric and physical comorbidity, mental illness severity, and service use. 
      METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the National Survey of American Life, a 
      national household probability sample of African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and 
      non-Hispanic Whites in the United States, were used (n = 1,950). The response 
      rate was 72.3%. RESULTS: Controlling for age, the lifetime prevalence rate of MDD 
      was 12.1% and the 12-month rate was 5.2%. Older Whites and Caribbean Blacks had 
      significantly higher lifetime prevalence than African Americans but 12-month 
      rates were similar across the three groups. Rates of co-occurring psychiatric 
      disorders and physical conditions were high and were similar for African 
      Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and Whites. Most older adults had either moderate or 
      severe 12-month MDD and most talked to at least one professional, most frequently 
      a family doctor, psychiatrist, or other mental health professional. CONCLUSION: 
      MDD among older adults is highly prevalent, often associated with other 
      psychiatric disorders or chronic physical conditions, and is associated with high 
      overall mental illness severity. Differences among older Blacks highlight the 
      need for further research on this population to ensure appropriate treatment is 
      being provided to these groups.

TI  - Citizens' perspectives on personalized medicine: a qualitative public 
      deliberation study.
PG  - 1197-201
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.300 [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to explore citizens' informed and reasoned values and 
      expectations of personalized medicine, a timely yet novel genomics policy issue. 
      A qualitative, public deliberation study was undertaken using a citizens' 
      reference panel on health technologies, established to provide input to the 
      health technology assessment process in Ontario, Canada. The citizens' panel 
      consisted of five women and nine men, aged 18-71 years, with one member selected 
      from each health authority region. There were shared expectations among the 
      citizens' panel members for the potential of personalized medicine technologies 
      to improve care, provided they are deemed clinically valid and effective. These 
      expectations were tempered by concerns about value for money and the possibility 
      that access to treatment may be limited by personalized medicine tests used to 
      stratify patients. Although they questioned the presumed technological imperative 
      presented by personalized medicine technologies, they called for increased 
      efforts to prepare the health-care system to effectively integrate these 
      technologies. This study represents an early but important effort to explore 
      public values toward personalized medicine. This study also provides evidence of 
      the public's ability to form coherent judgments about a new policy issue. 
      Concerned that personalized tests might be used to ration care, they suggested 
      that treatment should be made available if patients wanted it, irrespective of 
      tests that indicate little benefit. This issue raises clinical and policy 
      challenges that may undermine the value of personalized medicine. Further efforts 
      to deliberate with the public are warranted to inform effective, efficient and 
      equitable translation of personalized medicine.

TI  - Enhancing citizen engagement in cancer screening through deliberative democracy.
PG  - 380-6
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djs649 [doi]
AB  - Cancer screening is widely practiced and participation is promoted by various 
      social, technical, and commercial drivers, but there are growing concerns about 
      the emerging harms, risks, and costs of cancer screening. Deliberative democracy 
      methods engage citizens in dialogue on substantial and complex problems: 
      especially when evidence and values are important and people need time to 
      understand and consider the relevant issues. Information derived from such 
      deliberations can provide important guidance to cancer screening policies: 
      citizens' values are made explicit, revealing what really matters to people and 
      why. Policy makers can see what informed, rather than uninformed, citizens would 
      decide on the provision of services and information on cancer screening. Caveats 
      can be elicited to guide changes to existing policies and practices. Policies 
      that take account of citizens' opinions through a deliberative democracy process 
      can be considered more legitimate, justifiable, and feasible than those that 
      don't.

TI  - Psychological and environmental correlates of HPA axis functioning in parentally 
      bereaved children: preliminary findings.
PG  - 233-40
LID - 10.1002/jts.21788 [doi]
AB  - This study examined bereaved children's HPA-axis functioning (cortisol awakening 
      response; CAR) in relation to psychological distress, coping, and surviving 
      parents' grief reactions. Participants included 38 children (20 girls) with 
      recent parental loss (previous 6 months) and 28 of their surviving caregivers (23 
      women) who were assessed using self-report instruments and in-person, 
      semistructured interviews. Interviews involved discussions about the child's 
      thoughts and feelings related to the loss. Participants provided 3 saliva samples 
      at home (awakening, 30 minutes later, and evening) over 3 successive days, 
      beginning on the day following the interview. Results show a significant relation 
      between dampening of the child's Day 1 CAR and more symptoms of anxiety (r = 
      -.45), depression (r = -.40), posttraumatic stress (r = -.45), and maladaptive 
      grief (r = -.43), as well as higher levels of avoidant coping (r = -.53). Higher 
      levels of parental maladaptive grief were also associated (r = -.47) with a 
      dampening of the child's Day 1 CAR. Our results raise the possibility that 
      blunted CAR may be a result of accumulating allostatic load and/or a result of 
      emotionally challenging events (discussions regarding the deceased) and their 
      subsequent processing (or lack thereof) within the family, which may be 
      particularly stressful for those bereaved children experiencing high levels of 
      psychological distress, avoidant coping, and parental maladaptive grief.

TI  - DHEA enhances emotion regulation neurocircuits and modulates memory for emotional 
      stimuli.
PG  - 1798-807
LID - 10.1038/npp.2013.79 [doi]
AB  - Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a neurosteroid with anxiolytic, antidepressant, 
      and antiglucocorticoid properties. It is endogenously released in response to 
      stress, and may reduce negative affect when administered exogenously. Although 
      there have been multiple reports of DHEA's antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, 
      no research to date has examined the neural pathways involved. In particular, 
      brain imaging has not been used to link neurosteroid effects to emotion 
      neurocircuitry. To investigate the brain basis of DHEA's impact on emotion 
      modulation, patients were administered 400 mg of DHEA (N=14) or placebo (N=15) 
      and underwent 3T fMRI while performing the shifted-attention emotion appraisal 
      task (SEAT), a test of emotional processing and regulation. Compared with 
      placebo, DHEA reduced activity in the amygdala and hippocampus, enhanced 
      connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, and enhanced activity in the 
      rACC. These activation changes were associated with reduced negative affect. DHEA 
      reduced memory accuracy for emotional stimuli, and also reduced activity in 
      regions associated with conjunctive memory encoding. These results demonstrate 
      that DHEA reduces activity in regions associated with generation of negative 
      emotion and enhances activity in regions linked to regulatory processes. 
      Considering that activity in these regions is altered in mood and anxiety 
      disorders, our results provide initial neuroimaging evidence that DHEA may be 
      useful as a pharmacological intervention for these conditions and invite further 
      investigation into the brain basis of neurosteroid emotion regulatory effects.

PG  - 45S-57S
LID - 10.1177/1557988313493697 [doi]
AB  - This study reports findings from the Black Women's Perceptions of Black Men's 
      Depression (BWP) study, which included eight focus groups with Black women (N = 
      46) from southeastern Michigan. Four themes illustrated the impressions of Black 
      women from different socioeconomic backgrounds: Black men's depression is a 
      cultured and gendered phenomenon, the role of Black women in Black men's 
      depression, intergenerational differences with how depression is handled by Black 
      men, and the need (and ways) to reach Black men with depression resources. 
      Results underscore not only the importance of understanding the kind of 
      depression in Black men that meets criteria described by the Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) but also the psychological distress 
      that may coexist with (or be separate from) DSM depression. Implications for 
      interventions that educate, diagnose, and treat depression in Black men are 
      discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impacts of a Citizens' Reference Panel on the 
      deliberations of a provincial health technology advisory committee and its 
      secretariat, which produce, recommendations for the use of health technologies in 
      Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A fourteen-member citizens' reference panel was 
      convened five times between February 2009 and May 2010 to participate in 
      informed, facilitated discussions to inform the assessment of individual 
      technologies and provincial health technology assessment processes more 
      generally. Qualitative data collection methods were used to document observed and 
      perceived impacts of the citizens' panel on the health technology assessment 
      (HTA) process. RESULTS: Panel impacts were observed for all technologies 
      reviewed, at two different stages in the HTA process, and represented macro- 
      (raising awareness) and micro-level (informing recommendations) impacts. These 
      impacts were shaped by periodic opportunities for direct and brokered exchange 
      between the Panel and the expert advisory committee to clarify roles, foster 
      accountability, and build trust. Our findings offer new insights about one of the 
      main considerations in the design of deliberative participatory structures-how to 
      maintain the independence of a citizens' panel while ensuring that their input is 
      considered at key junctures in the HTA process. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens' panels can 
      exert various impacts on the HTA process. Ensuring these types of structures 
      include opportunities for direct exchange between citizens and experts, to 
      clarify roles, promote accountability, and build trust will facilitate their 
      impacts in a variety of settings.

AB  - Fluctuation Transmission Electron Microscopy (FTEM) has a unique ability to probe 
      topological order on the 1-3 nm length scale in diffraction amorphous materials. 
      However, extracting a quantitative description of the order has been challenging. 
      We report that the FTEM covariance, computed at two non-degenerate Bragg 
      reflections, is able to distinguish different regimes of size vs. volume fraction 
      of order. The covariance analysis is general and does not require a 
      material-specific atomistic model. We use a Monte-Carlo approach to compute 
      different regimes of covariance, based on the probability of exciting multiple 
      Bragg reflections when a STEM nanobeam interacts with a volume containing ordered 
      regions in an amorphous matrix. We perform experimental analysis on several 
      sputtered amorphous thin films including a-Si, nitrogen-alloyed GeTe and 
      Ge(2)Sb(2)Te(5). The samples contain a wide variety of ordered states. Comparison of 
      experimental data with the covariance simulation reveals different regimes of 
      nanoscale topological order.

TI  - The visible politics of the privatization debate in Quebec.
PG  - 67-79
AB  - This paper analyzes the debates surrounding the privatization of health services 
      financing in Quebec. The objective is to clarify policy-making processes with 
      regard to this important issue and, more generally, to provide a realistic 
      understanding of health-related policy processes in Canada. The analysis is based 
      on a large and continuous sample of mass media and National Assembly debates on 
      the question during the four-and-a-half years following the Chaoulli ruling of 
      the Supreme Court of Canada. These data are used to test four hypotheses about 
      relationships among the types of political actors involved, their policy 
      preferences, the rhetoric they use and the anticipated policy effects they 
      assert. The results are applied to a discussion of questions about the factors 
      that influence the effectiveness of political communication.

TI  - How contexts and issues influence the use of policy-relevant research syntheses: 
      a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 604-48
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12026 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Evidence briefs have emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing the 
      best available research evidence for health system policymakers and stakeholders. 
      An evidence brief may draw on systematic reviews and many other types of 
      policy-relevant information, including local data and studies, to describe a 
      problem, options for addressing it, and key implementation considerations. We 
      conducted a systematic review to examine the ways in which context- and 
      issue-related factors influence the perceived usefulness of evidence briefs among 
      their intended users. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis approach 
      to review both empirical and nonempirical literature and to develop a model that 
      explains how context and issues influence policymakers' and stakeholders' views 
      of the utility of evidence briefs prepared for priority policy issues. We used a 
      "compass" question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic 
      searches in CINAHL, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, IPSA, MEDLINE, OAIster (gray literature), 
      ProQuest A&I Theses, ProQuest (Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences 
      Index and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International 
      Bibliography of Social Sciences, PAIS, Political Science), PsychInfo, Web of 
      Science, and WilsonWeb (Social Science Abstracts). Finally, we used a grounded 
      and interpretive analytic approach to synthesize the results. FINDINGS: Of the 
      4,461 papers retrieved, 3,908 were excluded and 553 were assessed for 
      "relevance," with 137 included in the initial sample of papers to be analyzed and 
      an additional 23 purposively sampled to fill conceptual gaps. Several themes 
      emerged: (1) many established types of "evidence" are viewed as useful content in 
      an evidence brief, along with several promising formatting features; (2) 
      contextual factors, particularly the institutions, interests, and values of a 
      given context, can influence views of evidence briefs; (3) whether an issue is 
      polarizing and whether it is salient (or not) and familiar (or not) to actors in 
      the policy arena can influence views of evidence briefs prepared for that issue; 
      (4) influential factors can emerge in several ways (as context driven, issue 
      driven, or a result of issue-context resonance); (5) these factors work through 
      two primary pathways, affecting either the users or the producers of briefs; and 
      (6) these factors influence views of evidence briefs through a variety of 
      mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Those persons funding and preparing evidence briefs need 
      to consider a variety of context- and issue-related factors when deciding how to 
      make them most useful in policymaking.

AB  - Selective thermal emission in a useful range of energies from a material 
      operating at high temperatures is required for effective solar thermophotovoltaic 
      energy conversion. Three-dimensional metallic photonic crystals can exhibit 
      spectral emissivity that is modified compared with the emissivity of unstructured 
      metals, resulting in an emission spectrum useful for solar thermophotovoltaics. 
      However, retention of the three-dimensional mesostructure at high temperatures 
      remains a significant challenge. Here we utilize self-assembled templates to 
      fabricate high-quality tungsten photonic crystals that demonstrate unprecedented 
      thermal stability up to at least 1,400  degrees C and modified thermal emission at solar 
      thermophotovoltaic operating temperatures. We also obtain comparable thermal and 
      optical results using a photonic crystal comprising a previously unstudied 
      material, hafnium diboride, suggesting that refractory metallic ceramic materials 
      are viable candidates for photonic crystal-based solar thermophotovoltaic devices 
      and should be more extensively studied.

AB  - It is often useful to replace a small region of the yeast genome containing a 
      gene of interest with a selectable marker. The selectable marker allows for easy 
      identification of yeast cells that have successfully carried out the gene 
      replacement, and functional consequences of the loss of that gene can then be 
      assessed. The same technique can also be used for removing noncoding portions of 
      the genome that may be of interest, such as promoters or 3' or 5' UTRs, and for 
      introducing tags on the N- or C-termini of proteins (alternatively, see a 
      marker-free yeast gene replacement method on Gene Knockouts, in vivo 
      site-directed mutagenesis and Other Modifications Using the Delitto Perfetto 
      System in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

TI  - Biased Brownian ratcheting leads to pre-mRNA remodeling and capture prior to 
      first-step splicing.
PG  - 1450-7
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.2704 [doi]
AB  - The spliceosome is a dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machine that catalyzes the 
      removal of introns during the two transesterification steps of eukaryotic 
      pre-mRNA splicing. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer to monitor the distance of the 5' splice site (5' SS) and branch point 
      (BP) of pre-mRNA in affinity-purified spliceosomes stalled by a mutation in the 
      DExD/H-box helicase Prp2 immediately before the first splicing step. Addition of 
      recombinant Prp2 together with NTP and protein cofactor Spp2 rearranges the 
      spliceosome-substrate complex to reversibly explore conformations with proximal 
      5' SS and BP that accommodate chemistry. Addition of Cwc25, a small heat-stable 
      splicing factor, then strongly biases this equilibrium toward the proximal 
      conformation, promoting efficient first-step splicing. The spliceosome thus 
      functions as a biased Brownian ratchet machine where a helicase unlocks thermal 
      fluctuations subsequently rectified by a cofactor 'pawl', a principle possibly 
      widespread among the many helicase-driven RNPs.

AB  - While showing unconscious influences on complex decisions is indeed difficult, 
      relevant awareness in relatively simpler subliminal paradigms is more easily 
      assessed. Utilizing objective detection (vs. more typical identification or 
      classification) tasks to assess awareness overcomes longstanding residual 
      methodological problems, and prior work using such methods (e.g., Snodgrass & 
      Shevrin 2006) clearly shows unconscious influences on simple decisions.

AB  - The present study investigated the relationship between discrimination and social 
      anxiety disorder (SAD) in a sample of African-Americans, Caribbean blacks, and 
      non-Hispanic whites using the National Survey of American Life, the most 
      comprehensive study of psychopathology among American blacks to date (N = 6082). 
      Previous work has highlighted a strong association between discrimination and 
      mental health symptoms (Keith, Lincoln, Taylor, and Jackson [Sex Roles 62:48-59, 
      ]; Kessler, Mickelson, and Williams [J Health Soc Behav 40:208-230, 1999]; Soto, 
      Dawson-Andoh, and BeLue [J Anxiety Disord 25:258-265, ]). However, few studies 
      have examined the effects of particular types of discrimination on specific 
      anxiety disorders or among different black subgroups. In this study, logistic 
      regression analyses indicated that everyday but not major experiences of 
      discrimination are associated with SAD for African-Americans, Caribbean blacks, 
      and non-Hispanic whites. This study adds to the extant literature by 
      demonstrating that specific types of discrimination may be uniquely associated 
      with SAD for different ethnic/racial groups.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify imaging-based 
      predictors of progression in patients treated with SABR for stage I NSCLC. 
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between March 2003 and December 2012, 117 patients with 
      stage I NSCLC meeting our study criteria were treated with SABR at Stanford 
      University. Median follow-up was 17 months (range, 3-74 months) for all patients 
      and 19 months for living patients (range, 3-74 months). Tumors were classified 
      according to whether or not they contacted the pleura adjacent to the chest wall 
      or mediastinum (MP), according to their maximum dimension based on computed 
      tomography scans, and, for 102 patients who had archived pretreatment fluorine-18 
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography scans, according to SUVmax. 
      RESULTS: Ten patients (9%) developed local progression, 17 (15%) developed 
      regional progression, and 19 (16%) developed distant metastasis. Two-year freedom 
      from local progression, freedom from regional progression, and freedom from 
      distant metastasis (FFDM) were 88%, 83%, and 83%, respectively. Overall survival 
      was 70% at 2 years. FFDM was significantly associated with MP contact, maximum 
      tumor dimension, and SUVmax, and these variables could be combined into an 
      exploratory prognostic index that identified patients at highest risk for 
      developing metastases. CONCLUSION: In our cohort, noninvasive, imaging-based 
      features were associated with distant progression after SABR for early stage 
      NSCLC. If validated, our prognostic index could allow identification of patients 
      who might benefit from systemic therapy after SABR.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has historically been a positive predictor of surgical 
      morbidity, especially in the morbidly obese. The purpose of our study was to 
      compare outcomes of obese patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). 
      METHODS: We reviewed 1382 consecutive patients retrospectively who underwent LC 
      for various pathologies from January 2008 to August 2011. Patients were 
      stratified based on the World Health Organization definitions of obesity: 
      nonobese (body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m(2)), obesity class I (BMI 
      30-34.9 kg/m(2)), obesity class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m(2)), and obesity class III 
      (BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2)). The primary end points were conversion rates and surgical 
      morbidity. The secondary end point was length of stay. RESULTS: There were 
      significantly more females in the obesity II and III groups (P = 0.0002). 
      American Society of Anesthesiologists scores were significantly higher in the 
      obesity I, II, and III groups compared with the nonobese (P < 0.05; P < 0.01; and 
      P < 0.0001, respectively). Independent predictors of conversion on multivariate 
      analysis (MVA) included age (P = 0.01), acute cholecystitis (P = 0.03), operative 
      time (P < 0.0001), blood loss (P < 0.0001), and fellowship-trained surgeons 
      (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of intraoperative complications on MVA 
      included age (P = 0.009), white patients (P = 0.009), previous surgery 
      (P = 0.001), operative time (P < 0.0001), and blood loss (P = 0.01). Independent 
      predictors of postoperative complications on MVA included American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists score (P < 0.0001), acute cholecystitis (P < 0.0001), and a 
      postoperative complication (P < 0.0001). BMI was not a predictor of conversions 
      or surgical morbidity. Length of stay was not significantly different between the 
      four groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that overall conversion rates 
      and surgical morbidity are relatively low following LC, even in obese and 
      morbidly obese patients.

TI  - Single-incision pediatric endosurgical epigastric hernia repair.
PG  - 357-60
LID - 10.1007/s10029-014-1235-7 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Epigastric hernias represent about 4 % of all abdominal hernias in 
      children and require surgical repair. Traditionally, these hernias are repaired 
      by an open surgical technique. More recently, laparoscopic epigastric hernia 
      repairs have been described using two trocars in the upper abdomen. In this 
      paper, we describe a novel single-incision pediatric endosurgical (SIPES) 
      technique. METHODS: Patients with symptomatic epigastric hernias that were deemed 
      to be too far superior to be repaired with an open technique through an umbilical 
      incision were selected for SIPES repair. Two trocars (5 and 3 mm) were introduced 
      through a single umbilical incision and the hernia repair was performed using 
      looped 4-0 polypropylene sutures introduced through a 17-gage spinal needle in a 
      lasso technique. RESULTS: Five girls (age 4.4-12.6, median 6.4 years) underwent 
      single-incision endosurgical epigastric hernia repair. The mean operative time 
      was 25 +/- 6 min, and there were no intraoperative complications. All patients were 
      discharged home from the recovery room on the day of surgery. All patients were 
      followed up 2-3 weeks after the operation, with no recurrence and excellent 
      cosmetic results. CONCLUSIONS: The described SIPES technique offers a virtually 
      scarless, quick, and simple option for the repair of symptomatic epigastric 
      hernias that can be performed with standard laparoscopic equipment.

AB  - PURPOSE: Metal artifacts can degrade computed tomographic (CT) simulation imaging 
      and impair accurate delineation of tumors for radiation treatment planning 
      purposes. We investigated a Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine-based 
      metal artifact reduction technique in tonsillar cancer delineation. METHODS AND 
      MATERIALS: Eight patients with significant artifact and tonsil cancer were 
      evaluated. Each patient had a positron emission tomography (PET)-CT and a 
      contrast-enhanced CT obtained at the same setting during radiotherapy simulation. 
      The CTs were corrected for artifact using the metal deletion technique (MDT). Two 
      radiation oncologists independently delineated primary gross tumor volumes (GTVs) 
      for each patient on native (CTnonMDT), metal corrected (CTMDT), and reference 
      standard (CTPET/nonMDT) imaging, 1 week apart. Mixed effects models were used to 
      determine if differences among GTVs were statistically significant. Two 
      diagnostic radiologists and 2 radiation oncologists independently qualitatively 
      evaluated CTs for each patient. Ratings were on an ordinal scale from -3 to +3, 
      denoting that CTMDT was markedly, moderately, or slightly worse or better than 
      CTnonMDT. Scores were compared with a Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The 
      GTVPET/nonMDT were significantly smaller than GTVnonMDT (P = .004) and trended to 
      be smaller than GTVMDT (P = .084). The GTVnonMDT and GTVMDT were not 
      significantly different (P = .93). There was no significant difference in the 
      extent to which GTVnonMDT or GTVMDT encompassed GTVPET/nonMDT (P = .33). In the 
      subjective assessment of image quality, CTMDT did not significantly outperform 
      CTnonMDT. In the majority of cases, the observer rated the CTMDT equivalent to 
      (53%) or slightly superior (41%) to the corresponding CTnonMDT. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      MTD modified images did not produce GTVMDT that more closely reproduced 
      GTVPET/nonMDT than did GTVnonMDT. Moreover, the MTD modified images were not 
      judged to be significantly superior when compared to the uncorrected images in 
      terms of subjective ability to visualize the tonsilar tumors. This study failed 
      to demonstrate value of the adjunctive use of a CT corrected for artifacts in the 
      tumor delineation process. Artifacts do make tumor delineation challenging, and 
      further investigation of other body sites is warranted.

TI  - Framing incremental expansions to public health insurance systems: the case of 
      Canadian pharmacare.
PG  - 295-330
LID - 10.1215/03616878-2416229 [doi]
AB  - Canada is the only country in the world to offer universal comprehensive public 
      health insurance that excludes outpatient prescription medicines. Few scholars 
      have attempted to explain this policy puzzle. We study media coverage of 
      prescription drug financing from 1990 to 2010 to elucidate how the policy problem 
      and potential solutions have been framed in media discourse and identify the 
      actors that have dominated media texts. We confirm previous analyses that have 
      revealed the significant role played by policy elites in media coverage of health 
      reform debates. We also find that proposed expansions to public coverage are 
      presented as a financial liability that could "crowd out" the existing (and 
      popular) public insurance program. Within the context of a predominantly public 
      funded system, framing of incremental expansion reorients away from values and 
      toward discourse related to costs--both of the current system and of potential 
      reforms. This may reflect a strategic narrative used by actors to maintain "silos 
      of values" for coverage for prescription medicines versus those for other 
      services. This has significant implications for the motivation for reform among 
      the electorate and politicians alike, and for the extent to which policy 
      developments, if they occurred, would legitimately reflect societal values for 
      health financing.

TI  - Modeling neuroendocrine stress reactivity in salivary cortisol: adjusting for 
      peak latency variability.
PG  - 285-95
LID - 10.3109/10253890.2014.915517 [doi]
AB  - In this report, we present growth curve modeling (GCM) with landmark registration 
      as an alternative statistical approach for the analysis of time series cortisol 
      data. This approach addresses an often-ignored but critical source of variability 
      in salivary cortisol analyses: individual and group differences in the time 
      latency of post-stress peak concentrations. It allows for the simultaneous 
      examination of cortisol changes before and after the peak while controlling for 
      timing differences, and thus provides additional information that can help 
      elucidate group differences in the underlying biological processes (e.g., 
      intensity of response, regulatory capacity). We tested whether GCM with landmark 
      registration is more sensitive than traditional statistical approaches (e.g., 
      repeated measures ANOVA--rANOVA) in identifying sex differences in salivary 
      cortisol responses to a psychosocial stressor (Trier Social Stress Test--TSST) in 
      healthy adults (mean age 23). We used plasma ACTH measures as our "standard" and 
      show that the new approach confirms in salivary cortisol the ACTH finding that 
      males had longer peak latencies, higher post-stress peaks but a more intense 
      post-peak decline. This finding would have been missed if only saliva cortisol 
      was available and only more traditional analytic methods were used. This new 
      approach may provide neuroendocrine researchers with a highly sensitive 
      complementary tool to examine the dynamics of the cortisol response in a way that 
      reduces risk of false negative findings when blood samples are not feasible.

TI  - Brief cognitive intervention can modulate neuroendocrine stress responses to the 
      Trier Social Stress Test: buffering effects of a compassionate goal orientation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is a critical mediator 
      linking stress to health. Understanding how to modulate its reactivity could 
      potentially help reduce the detrimental health effects of HPA axis activation. 
      Social evaluative threat is a potent activator of this system. Access to control 
      and coping responses can reduce its reactivity to pharmacological activation. 
      Compassionate or affiliative behaviors may also moderate stress reactivity. 
      Impact of these moderators on social evaluative threat is unknown. Here, we 
      tested the hypotheses that interventions to increase control, coping, or 
      compassionate (versus competitive) goals could reduce HPA-axis response to social 
      evaluative threat. METHODS: Healthy participants (n=54) were exposed to social 
      evaluative threat using the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). They were randomly 
      assigned to receive one of four different instructions prior to the stressor: 
      Standard TSST instructions (SI), standard instructions with access to "control" 
      (SI Control), or one of two cognitive interventions (CI) that (1) increased 
      familiarity and helped participants prepare coping strategies (CI Coping), or (2) 
      shifted goal orientation from self-promotion to helping others (CI Compassionate 
      Goals). ACTH and cortisol were obtained before and after stress exposure via 
      intravenous catheter. RESULTS: Control alone had no effect. CI Compassionate 
      Goals significantly reduced ACTH and cortisol responses to the TSST; CI Coping 
      raised baseline levels. Compassionate Goals reduced hormonal responses without 
      reducing subjective anxiety, stress or fear, while increasing expression of 
      pro-social intentions and focus on helping others. CONCLUSIONS: Brief 
      intervention to shift focus from competitive self-promotion to a goal orientation 
      of helping-others can reduce HPA-axis activation to a potent psychosocial 
      stressor. This supports the potential for developing brief interventions as 
      inoculation tools to reduce the impact of predictable stressors and lends support 
      to growing evidence that compassion and altruistic goals can moderate the effects 
      of stress.

LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu115 [doi]
AB  - Efficient, adaptive behavior relies on the ability to flexibly move between 
      internally focused (IF) and externally focused (EF) attentional states. Despite 
      evidence that IF cognitive processes such as event imagination comprise a 
      significant amount of awake cognition, the consequences of internal absorption on 
      the subsequent recruitment of brain networks during EF tasks are unknown. The 
      present functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study employed a novel 
      attentional state switching task. Subjects imagined positive and negative events 
      (IF task) or performed a working memory task (EF task) before switching to a 
      target detection (TD) task also requiring attention to external information, 
      allowing for the investigation of neural functioning during external attention 
      based on prior attentional state. There was a robust increase of activity in 
      frontal, parietal, and temporal regions during TD when subjects were previously 
      performing the EF compared with IF task, an effect that was most pronounced 
      following negative IF. Additionally, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was less 
      negatively coupled with ventromedial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices 
      during TD following IF compared with EF. These findings reveal the striking 
      consequences for brain activity following immersion in an IF attentional state, 
      which have strong implications for psychiatric disorders characterized by 
      excessive internal focus.

AB  - Trait and contextual factors can shape individual and group differences in 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) response to stress; but the ways in which 
      these factors may interact with each other to modulate stress activity have 
      rarely been examined. Here, we investigated whether the association between a 
      temperamental self-regulatory trait - Effortful Control (EC) - and HPA axis 
      stress response is moderated by type of laboratory stress in sixty-five children 
      (35 boys). EC was measured at ages 3 and 6 using age-appropriate laboratory 
      batteries as well as mother reports. HPA axis responses were measured at age 7 by 
      randomly assigning children to one of two laboratory stress tasks (frustration 
      vs. fear). Results indicated that EC interacted with stress context in predicting 
      cortisol response. Specifically, lower EC was associated with greater cortisol 
      response (steeper reactivity slopes) in the context of a frustration stressor but 
      this was reversed in a fear context where lower EC was associated with flatter, 
      more gradual activation. It is likely that different components of EC, such as 
      emotion regulation and attention, differentially interact with the stress 
      context. These types of effects and interactions need to be more thoroughly 
      understood in order to meaningfully interpret cortisol reactivity data and better 
      characterize the role of the HPA axis in human psychopathology.

LID - 10.1017/S1431927614012756 [doi]
AB  - Fluctuation electron microscopy can reveal the nanoscale order in amorphous 
      materials via the statistical variance in the scattering intensity as a function 
      of position, scattering vector, and resolution. However, several sources of 
      experimental artifacts can seriously affect the magnitude of the variance peaks. 
      The use of a scanning transmission electron microscope for data collection 
      affords a convenient means to check whether artifacts are present. As 
      nanodiffraction patterns are collected in serial, any spatial or temporal 
      dependence of the scattering intensity across the series can easily be detected. 
      We present examples of the major types of artifact and methods to correct the 
      data or to avoid the problem experimentally. We also re-cast the statistical 
      formalism used to identify sources of noise in view of the present results. The 
      present work provides a basis on which to perform fluctuation electron microscopy 
      with a high level of reliability and confidence in the quantitative magnitude of 
      the data.

TI  - Brain Mechanisms of Social Threat Effects on Working Memory.
PG  - 544-556
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhu206 [doi]
AB  - Social threat can have adverse effects on cognitive performance, but the brain 
      mechanisms underlying its effects are poorly understood. We investigated the 
      effects of social evaluative threat on working memory (WM), a core component of 
      many important cognitive capabilities. Social threat impaired WM performance 
      during an N-back task and produced widespread reductions in activation in lateral 
      prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), among other regions. In 
      addition, activity in frontal and parietal regions predicted WM performance, and 
      mediation analyses identified regions in the bilateral IPS that mediated the 
      performance-impairing effects of social threat. Social threat also decreased 
      connectivity between the IPS and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while increasing 
      connectivity between the IPS and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region 
      strongly implicated in the generation of autonomic and emotional responses. 
      Finally, cortisol response to the stressor did not mediate WM impairment but was 
      rather associated with protective effects. These results provide a basis for 
      understanding interactions between social and cognitive processes at a neural 
      systems level.

TI  - Impaired contextual modulation of memories in PTSD: an fMRI and 
      psychophysiological study of extinction retention and fear renewal.
PG  - 13435-43
LID - 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4287-13.2014 [doi]
AB  - Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients display pervasive fear memories, 
      expressed indiscriminately. Proposed mechanisms include enhanced fear learning 
      and impaired extinction or extinction recall. Documented extinction recall 
      deficits and failure to use safety signals could result from general failure to 
      use contextual information, a hippocampus-dependent process. This can be probed 
      by adding a renewal phase to standard conditioning and extinction paradigms. 
      Human subjects with PTSD and combat controls were conditioned (skin conductance 
      response), extinguished, and tested for extinction retention and renewal in a 
      scanner (fMRI). Fear conditioning (light paired with shock) occurred in one 
      context, followed by extinction in another, to create danger and safety contexts. 
      The next day, the extinguished conditioned stimulus (CS+E) was re-presented to 
      assess extinction recall (safety context) and fear renewal (danger context). PTSD 
      patients showed impaired extinction recall, with increased skin conductance and 
      heightened amygdala activity to the extinguished CS+ in the safety context. 
      However, they also showed impaired fear renewal; in the danger context, they had 
      less skin conductance response to CS+E and lower activity in amygdala and 
      ventral-medial prefrontal cortex compared with combat controls. Control subjects 
      displayed appropriate contextual modulation of memory recall, with extinction 
      (safety) memory prevailing in the safety context, and fear memory prevailing in 
      the danger context. PTSD patients could not use safety context to sustain 
      suppression of extinguished fear memory, but they also less effectively used 
      danger context to enhance fear. They did not display globally enhanced fear 
      expression, but rather showed a globally diminished capacity to use contextual 
      information to modulate fear expression.

TI  - Esophageal reinforcement with an extracellular scaffold during total gastrectomy 
      for gastric cancer.
PG  - 1252-7
LID - 10.1245/s10434-014-4125-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophagojejunal (EJ) anastomotic leaks after total gastrectomy (TG) 
      for malignancy lead to significant morbidity and mortality, thus affecting 
      long-term survival. Preclinical and clinical trials have shown promise in 
      utilizing degradable extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds in buttressing 
      anastomoses. We describe our experience buttressing the EJ anastomosis after TG 
      with a ECM scaffold. METHODS: From February 2012 to January 2014, a total of 37 
      consecutive patients underwent TG buttressing of the EJ anastomosis with the 
      degradable ECM scaffold composed of a porcine urinary bladder called MatriStem 
      (ACell Inc.). The scaffold was circumferentially wrapped around the EJ 
      anastomosis. The primary end point was the EJ leak rate, while the secondary end 
      point was the EJ stricture rate. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age and body mass index 
      were 59 +/- 16 years and 28.1 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2), respectively. Most patients were male 
      (51 %), white (78 %), and former smokers (51 %). Over half (59 %) underwent 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A minimally invasive TG was performed in 70 % of 
      patients. Signet ring was the most common tumor type (48 %), and most patients 
      had midstage disease (59 %). The mean number of lymph nodes procured was 36 +/- 16. 
      Eighteen patients (49 %) experienced a complication, mostly minor. One patient 
      (2.7 %) developed an EJ leak, while three patients (8 %) developed an EJ 
      stricture. Median follow-up was 7 months (range 2-12 months). There was no 
      operative or in-hospital mortality. DISCUSSION: The use of urinary bladder matrix 
      scaffolds may be helpful in decreasing the incidence of EJ anastomotic leak 
      and/or stricture. A prospective phase II trial at our institution is currently 
      under way.

AB  - Direct visualization of the dynamics of structural glasses and amorphous solids 
      on the sub-nanometer scale provides rich information unavailable from bulk or 
      conventional single molecule techniques. We study the surface of hafnium 
      diboride, a conductive ultrahigh temperature ceramic material that can be grown 
      in amorphous films. Our scanning tunneling movies have a second-to-hour dynamic 
      range and single-point current measurements extend that to the 
      millisecond-to-minute time scale. On the a-HfB2 glass surface, two-state hopping 
      of 1-2 nm diameter cooperatively rearranging regions or "clusters" occurs from 
      sub-milliseconds to hours. We characterize individual clusters in detail through 
      high-resolution (<0.5 nm) imaging, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and voltage 
      modulation, ruling out individual atoms, diffusing adsorbates, or pinned charges 
      as the origin of the observed two-state hopping. Smaller clusters are more likely 
      to hop, larger ones are more likely to be immobile. HfB2 has a very high bulk 
      glass transition temperature Tg, and we observe no three-state hopping or 
      sequential two-state hopping previously seen on lower Tg glass surfaces. The 
      electronic density of states of clusters does not change when they hop up or 
      down, allowing us to calibrate an accurate relative z-axis scale. By directly 
      measuring and histogramming single cluster vertical displacements, we can 
      reconstruct the local free energy landscape of individual clusters, complete with 
      activation barrier height, a reaction coordinate in nanometers, and the shape of 
      the free energy landscape basins between which hopping occurs. The experimental 
      images are consistent with the compact shape of alpha-relaxors predicted by random 
      first order transition theory, whereas the rapid hopping rate, even taking less 
      confined motion at the surface into account, is consistent with beta-relaxations. We 
      make a proposal of how "mixed" features can show up in surface dynamics of 
      glasses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research suggests that elevated stress hormones during exposure can 
      facilitate fear extinction in laboratory settings. However, prospective studies 
      on the clinical benefits of endogenous cortisol on clinical improvements in 
      naturalistic exposures are lacking. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with panic 
      disorder and agoraphobia completed three weekly in-vivo exposure sessions and a 
      fourth session 2 months following therapy completion, resulting in a total of 94 
      in-vivo exposure sessions. Salivary cortisol was collected at multiple times 
      during the first exposure day (cortisol morning response, prior, -during, -after 
      exposure) and at subsequent exposure sessions (prior, -during, -after exposure). 
      Cortisol collection on a non-exposure comparison day followed the same time 
      schedule as session 1. RESULTS: Exposure day anxiety and cortisol levels were 
      significantly higher than control day levels. Higher absolute cortisol levels 
      during exposures moderated clinical improvement (avoidance behavior, threat 
      appraisal, perceived control). Therapeutic gains were not just related to 
      exposure day cortisol levels, but were also linked to non-exposure day levels. 
      Greater morning rises in cortisol on exposure day predicted greater treatment 
      gains, but greater rises on the control day were associated with poorer outcomes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The study provides first evidence for a moderating effect of 
      cortisol awakening response and absolute cortisol levels on fear extinction 
      processes during naturalistic, prospective exposure-therapy. Additionally, we 
      replicated and extended prior findings on the therapeutic benefits of high 
      exposure cortisol levels. Together, the findings suggest that cortisol may act as 
      a general moderator of facilitated learning during exposure therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acute biliary pathology is a risk factor for conversion to open 
      surgery and increased surgical morbidity during laparoscopic cholecystectomy 
      (LC). The purpose of our study was to examine the impact of an advanced 
      laparoscopic fellowship-trained surgeon on risks of conversion, surgical 
      morbidity, and postoperative complications in this patient population. METHODS: 
      Of 1382 patients who underwent an LC from January 2008 to August 2011, 592 
      patients were diagnosed with an acute biliary process and were included in the 
      study. Patients were divided into two groups; those operated on by an advanced 
      laparoscopic fellowship-trained surgeon (N=237), and those operated on by a 
      non-laparoscopic fellowship-trained surgeon (N=355). The primary end-points were 
      conversion rates and surgical morbidity. The secondary end-point was operative 
      time. RESULTS: Fellowship-trained surgeons were more likely to perform IOC (57%) 
      versus non-fellowship trained surgeons (20%) (p<0.0001). The conversion rate for 
      the fellowship-trained group was significantly lower than for the non-fellowship 
      trained group (1.7% vs 8.5%, p=0.0004). The intraoperative and postoperative 
      complication rates for the fellowship-trained group were not significantly 
      different. The operative time was slightly longer in the non-fellowship trained 
      group compared to the fellowship-trained group (104 min vs 111 min, p=0.04). 
      DISCUSSION: Our data demonstrate that advanced laparoscopic fellowship training 
      decreases conversion rates of laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute biliary 
      pathology. Moreover, given the lower conversion rates, patients may have 
      experienced shorter hospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: Formal advanced laparoscopic 
      fellowship training may decrease length of stay among patients presenting with 
      acute biliary pathology who undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding cognitive and biological mechanisms of PTSD treatment 
      can help refine treatments and increase rates of response. METHODS: Thirty-six 
      veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive Prolonged exposure therapy 
      (PE) or Present-Centered therapy (PCT). We examined symptoms, trauma-related 
      cognitions, and two indices of HPA axis function (cortisol awakening response and 
      cortisol response to a script-driven imagery task). RESULTS: Thirty veterans 
      started treatment and 26 completed. PE resulted in significantly more symptom 
      reduction than PCT (P = .008). High treatment responders collapsed across 
      treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 
      min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08). At 
      midtreatment, high treatment responders showed higher cortisol levels throughout 
      the imagery task (Ps = .03-.04). There were no differences between high and low 
      treatment responders at posttreatment. Thoughts of incompetence (F (1.6, 35.8) = 
      16.8, P = .000) and a dangerous world (F (1.3, 29.9) = 8.2, P = .004) 
      significantly improved over time in high treatment responders but showed no 
      change in low responders. Script-associated cortisol response prior to treatment 
      and reductions in thoughts of incompetence accounted for 83% of the variance in 
      reductions in PTSD severity with PE. CONCLUSIONS: Both increased cortisol 
      response to personal trauma script prior to PTSD therapy and reductions in 
      cognitive symptoms of PTSD were significantly and uniquely related to reductions 
      in the core symptoms of PTSD in PE. However, contrary to our hypotheses, cortisol 
      measures were not related to cognitive changes.

AB  - Exposure to stressful or traumatic events is associated with increased 
      vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This vulnerability may be 
      partly mediated by effects of stress on the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and 
      associated circuitry. The PFC mediates critical cognitive functions, including 
      cognitive flexibility, which reflects an organism's ability to adaptively alter 
      behavior in light of changing contingencies. Prior work suggests that chronic or 
      acute stress exerts complex effects on different forms of cognitive flexibility, 
      via actions on the PFC. Similarly, PFC dysfunction is reported in PTSD, as are 
      executive function deficits. Animal models that permit study of the effects of 
      stress/trauma on cognitive flexibility may be useful in illuminating ways in 
      which stress-linked cognitive changes contribute to PTSD. Here, we examined the 
      behavioral effects of a rodent model of PTSD - single prolonged stress (SPS) - on 
      performance of two forms of cognitive flexibility: reversal learning and strategy 
      set-shifting. SPS did not impair acquisition of either a response or visual-cue 
      discrimination but did cause slight impairments in the retrieval of the 
      visual-cue rule. During response discrimination reversal, SPS rats made more 
      perseverative errors. In comparison, during set-shifting from the visual-cue to 
      response discrimination, SPS rats did not show enhanced perseveration, but did 
      display increased never-reinforced errors, indicative of impairment in selecting 
      a novel strategy. These data demonstrate that SPS leads to a complex and 
      intriguing pattern of deficits in flexible responding and suggest that 
      impairments in executive functioning associated with PTSD could, in part, be a 
      neuro-cognitive consequence of trauma exposure.

AB  - This study characterized the longitudinal evolution of HPA axis functioning from 
      7 to 16 months of age and identified individual and environmental factors that 
      shape changes in HPA axis functioning over time. Participants were 167 
      mother-infant dyads drawn from a larger longitudinal study, recruited based on 
      maternal history of being maltreated during childhood. Salivary cortisol levels 
      were assessed before and after age-appropriate psychosocial stressors when 
      infants were 7 and 16 months old. Maternal observed parenting and maternal 
      reports of infant and environmental characteristics were obtained at 7 months and 
      evaluated as predictors of changes in infant baseline cortisol and reactivity 
      from 7 to 16 months. Results revealed that infants did not show a cortisol 
      response at 7 months, but reactivity to psychosocial stress emerged by 16 months. 
      Individual differences in cortisol baseline and reactivity levels over time were 
      related to infant sex and maternal overcontrolling behaviors, underscoring the 
      malleable and socially informed nature of early HPA axis functioning. Findings 
      can inform prevention and intervention efforts to promote healthy stress 
      regulation during infancy.

TI  - Urban vs Rural Residence and the Prevalence of Depression and Mood Disorder Among 
      African American Women and Non-Hispanic White Women.
PG  - 576-83
LID - 10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2015.10 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: There is a paucity of research among African Americans and rural 
      residents. Little is known about the association between urbanicity and 
      depression or about the interaction of urbanicity, race/ethnicity, and sex on 
      depression and mood disorder prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To examine the interaction of 
      urbanicity and race/ethnicity on lifetime and 12-month major depressive disorder 
      (MDD) and mood disorder prevalence for African American women and non-Hispanic 
      white women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The US National Survey of 
      American Life data were used to examine the interaction of urbanicity and 
      race/ethnicity on lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of DSM-IV MDD and mood disorder 
      among female respondents, who included noninstitutionalized African American, 
      Caribbean black, and non-Hispanic white women in the United States between 
      February 2001 and June 2003. Participants included 1462 African American women 
      and 341 non-Hispanic white women recruited from the South because all suburban 
      and rural National Survey of American Life respondents resided in this region. 
      Bivariate multiple logistic regression and adjusted prevalence analyses were 
      performed. Urban, suburban, or rural location (assessed via Rural-Urban Continuum 
      Codes), self-reported race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic factors (age, 
      education, household income, and marital status) were included in the analysis. 
      MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Lifetime and 12-month MDD and mood disorder assessed 
      via the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. 
      RESULTS: Compared with urban African American women, rural African American women 
      had a significantly lower odds of meeting criteria for lifetime (odds ratio [OR], 
      0.39; 95% CI, 0.23-0.65) and 12-month (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.18-0.46) MDD and for 
      lifetime (F = 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29-0.73) and 12-month (F = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.26-0.66) 
      mood disorder. However, the interaction of urbanicity and race/ethnicity 
      suggested that rural non-Hispanic white women had a significantly higher odds of 
      meeting criteria for lifetime (OR, 2.76; 95% CI, 1.22-6.24) and 12-month (OR, 
      9.48; 95% CI, 4.65-19.34) MDD and for lifetime (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.06-4.87) and 
      12-month (OR, 5.99; 95% CI, 3.01-11.94) mood disorder than rural African American 
      women. Adjusted prevalence analyses revealed significantly lower rates of 
      lifetime (4.2%) and 12-month (1.5%) MDD among rural African American women than 
      their urban counterparts (10.4% vs 5.3%; P </= .01). The same pattern was found for 
      mood disorder, with rural African American women experiencing significantly lower 
      rates of lifetime (6.7%) and 12-month (3.3%) mood disorder when compared to urban 
      African American women (13.9% vs 7.6%; P </= .01) Conversely, rural non-Hispanic 
      white women had significantly higher rates of 12-month MDD (10.3%) and mood 
      disorder (10.3%) than their urban counterparts (3.7% vs 3.8%; P </= .01). 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rural residence differentially influences MDD and mood 
      disorder prevalence among African American women and non-Hispanic white women. 
      These findings offer a first step toward understanding the cumulative effect of 
      rural residence and race/ethnicity on women's depression prevalence, suggesting 
      the need for further research in this area.

AB  - The concept of public involvement use is not well-defined in the literature. 
      Previous research studies have provided brief accounts of how public involvement 
      may influence health policy, but have not detailed the internal dynamics and 
      process through which it is actually used in the policy process. The study 
      objective is to examine and clarify the concept and process of public involvement 
      use in health policy decision-making. Using qualitative concept analysis methods, 
      we reviewed the literature on the use of public involvement and conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with key informants who have theoretical and/or 
      practical insights on public involvement and its use in policy decision-making. 
      Our findings are organized around interrelated questions that animate how the 
      concept of use is understood, interpreted, and operationalized. In asking, "How 
      is 'use' perceived in relation to health policy decision-making?" meanings are 
      constructed for the concept by identifying differences and drawing connections 
      between "use" and related terms. In asking "How would one know if public 
      involvement was used in health policy decision-making?" our findings weigh in on 
      the act of listening as a precursor to use, the ways in which use is mediated, 
      and responses to the input obtained from public involvement processes as signals 
      of use. These findings are a first step toward improving conceptual clarity about 
      what public involvement use means, how it is understood and interpreted by 
      relevant actors in the public involvement and public policy fields, and how it 
      might be operationalized. We expect our findings to be particularly useful for 
      public involvement practitioners who are often confronted with questions from 
      public involvement participants regarding how their input will be used in health 
      policy decision-making.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We proposed to develop a novel virtual reality (VR) team training 
      system. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of creating 
      a VR operating room to simulate a surgical crisis scenario and evaluate the 
      simulator for construct and face validity. METHODS: We modified ICE STORM 
      (Integrated Clinical Environment; Systems, Training, Operations, Research, 
      Methods), a VR-based system capable of modeling a variety of health care 
      personnel and environments. ICE STORM was used to simulate a standardized 
      surgical crisis scenario, whereby participants needed to correct 4 elements 
      responsible for loss of laparoscopic visualization. The construct and face 
      validity of the environment were measured. RESULTS: Thirty-three participants 
      completed the VR simulation. Attendings completed the simulation in less time 
      than trainees (271 vs 201 seconds, P = .032). Participants felt the training 
      environment was realistic and had a favorable impression of the simulation. All 
      participants felt the workload of the simulation was low. CONCLUSIONS: Creation 
      of a VR-based operating room for team training in surgery is feasible and can 
      afford a realistic team training environment.

TI  - Supporting quality public and patient engagement in health system organizations: 
      development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation 
      Tool.
PG  - 817-27
LID - 10.1111/hex.12378 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Only rudimentary tools exist to support health system organizations 
      to evaluate their public and patient engagement (PPE) activities. This study 
      responds to this gap by developing a generic evaluation tool for use in a wide 
      range of organizations. METHODS: The evaluation tool was developed through an 
      iterative, collaborative process informed by a review of published and grey 
      literature and with the input of Canadian PPE researchers and practitioners. Over 
      a 3-year period, structured e-mail, telephone and face-to-face exchanges, 
      including a modified Delphi process, were used to produce an evaluation tool that 
      includes core principles of high-quality engagement, expected outcomes for each 
      principle and three unique evaluation questionnaires that were tested and revised 
      with input from 65 end users. RESULTS: The tool is structured around four core 
      principles of 'quality engagement': (i) integrity of design and process; (ii) 
      influence and impact; (iii) participatory culture; and (iv) collaboration and 
      common purpose. Three unique questionnaires were developed to assess each of 
      these four evaluation domains from the following perspectives: (i) those who 
      participate in PPE activities; (ii) those who plan, execute or sponsor PPE 
      activities within organizations; and (iii) those who provide the leadership and 
      capacity for PPE within their organizations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known 
      collaboration of researchers and practitioners in the co-design of a 
      comprehensive PPE evaluation tool aimed at three distinct respondent groups and 
      for use in a wide range of health system organization settings.

AB  - The community participation literature has produced numerous frameworks to guide 
      practice and evaluation of community participation strategies in the health 
      sector. These frameworks are useful starting points for differentiating the 
      approaches for involving people in planning and decision-making for health 
      services, but have been critiqued for being too generic and ignoring that 
      community participation is highly contextual and situational. Health service 
      organizations across Canada and internationally have begun to respond to address 
      this limitation by developing more context-specific community participation 
      frameworks; however, such frameworks do not exist for Ontario Community Health 
      Centres (CHCs)-local primary health care organizations with a mandate to engage 
      marginalized groups in planning and decision-making for health services. We 
      conducted a series of focus groups with staff members from four Ontario CHCs to: 
      (1) examine the factors that would influence their use of a generic framework for 
      community participation with marginalized populations; and (2) improve the 
      "context-specificity" of this framework, to enhance its relevance to CHCs. 
      Participants described the difficulty of organizing the contextual, multi-faceted 
      and situational process of community participation that they experienced with 
      marginalized populations into a single framework, which led them to question the 
      value of using frameworks as a resource for guiding the design, implementation 
      and evaluation of their community participation initiatives. Instead, 
      participants revealed that tacit knowledge, in the form of professional and 
      personal experience and local knowledge of a marginalized population, had a 
      greater influence on guiding participation activities in Ontario CHCs. Our 
      findings suggest that tacit knowledge is an essential feature of community 
      participation practice and requires further exploration regarding its role in the 
      community participation field.

PG  - 1077-84
LID - 10.1038/nmeth.3602 [doi]
AB  - We report Single Molecule Cluster Analysis (SiMCAn), which utilizes hierarchical 
      clustering of hidden Markov modeling-fitted single-molecule fluorescence 
      resonance energy transfer (smFRET) trajectories to dissect the complex 
      conformational dynamics of biomolecular machines. We used this method to study 
      the conformational dynamics of a precursor mRNA during the splicing cycle as 
      carried out by the spliceosome. By clustering common dynamic behaviors derived 
      from selectively blocked splicing reactions, SiMCAn was able to identify the 
      signature conformations and dynamic behaviors of multiple ATP-dependent 
      intermediates. In addition, it identified an open conformation adopted late in 
      splicing by a 3' splice-site mutant, invoking a mechanism for substrate 
      proofreading. SiMCAn enables rapid interpretation of complex single-molecule 
      behaviors and should prove useful for the comprehensive analysis of a plethora of 
      dynamic cellular machines.

TI  - Presurgical Psychological and Neuroendocrine Predictors of Psychiatric Morbidity 
      After Major Vascular Surgery: A Prospective Longitudinal Study.
PG  - 993-1005
LID - 10.1097/PSY.0000000000000235 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Major life stressors, including major surgeries, are often followed 
      by psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Prior retrospective work found abdominal 
      aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is followed by increased psychiatric morbidity, 
      which may adversely influence physical and functional recovery. Identifying risk 
      factors before surgery, such as dysregulation in stress response systems, might 
      be useful in improving preventative intervention. METHODS: Two hundred sixteen 
      patients receiving open AAA or aortofemoral bypass surgeries, endovascular AAA 
      repair, or nonsurgical AAA treatment were recruited from two vascular surgery 
      services. Psychiatric symptoms and salivary cortisol measures (waking, 4 PM, and 
      11 PM, before and after low-dose dexamethasone) were obtained at intake and 3- 
      and 9-month follow-ups. RESULTS: After open surgeries, 18% of patients had new 
      psychiatric disorders, compared with 4% of patients receiving endovascular AAA 
      repair or nonsurgical treatment (odds ratio = 6.0, 95% confidence interval = 
      1.6-22.1, p = .007). Having a history of major depression predicted the onset of 
      new disorders in surgical patients. Presurgical cortisol levels were associated 
      with both baseline (r = 0.23, p < .05) and 9-month (r = 0.32, p < .01) 
      psychiatric symptoms (cortisol B = 1.0, standard error = 0.48, p < .05, in 
      repeated-measures mixed model). CONCLUSIONS: Open AAA repair surgery is 
      prospectively linked to the development of psychiatric morbidity, and history of 
      depression elevates risk. Cortisol measures before surgery are associated with 
      current and future psychological functioning, suggesting potential 
      neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to vulnerability. These results 
      can help identify surgical patients at risk and point to potential targets for 
      risk reduction interventions.

TI  - The mental health of US Black women: the roles of social context and severe 
      intimate partner violence.
PG  - e008415

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Black women continue to have rates of mental health conditions that 
      can be negative for their well-being. This study examined the contribution of 
      social and contextual factors and severe physical intimate partner violence on 
      the mental health of US Black women (African-American and Caribbean Black). 
      SETTING: Data were largely collected via in-person community interviews at 
      participants' homes. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3277 African-American and Black 
      Caribbean women from the 2001-2003 National Survey of American Life (NSAL), the 
      largest and most complete sample of Blacks residing in the USA. PRIMARY AND 
      SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Key outcomes included an array of psychiatric disorders based 
      on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). RESULTS: 
      Bivariate results revealed noticeably high rates of any anxiety disorder, 
      post-traumatic stress disorder, any substance disorder, alcohol abuse disorder, 
      suicide ideation and attempts, and any overall mental disorder among 
      African-American women relative to Caribbean Black women. Multiple social and 
      contextual factors were associated with various mental disorders among both sets 
      of Black women in multivariate models, with the most consistent associations 
      found for severe physical intimate partner violence. Everyday discrimination was 
      associated with anxiety disorders (95% AOR=2.08 CI 1.23 to 3.51), eating 
      disorders (95% AOR=2.69 CI 1.38 to 5.22), and any disorder (95% AOR=2.18 CI 1.40 
      to 3.40), while neighbourhood drug problems contributed to mood (95% AOR=1.19 CI 
      1.04 to 1.36), substance disorders (95% AOR=1.37 CI 1.11 to 1.69) and any 
      disorder (95% AOR=1.18 CI 1.03 to 1.34). CONCLUSIONS: Severe physical intimate 
      partner violence, discrimination, and to a lesser extent, neighbourhood problems 
      are important predictors of Black women's health, findings that inform 
      intervention and clinical services tailored to meet the needs of Black women from 
      diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds.

PG  - 101-8
LID - 10.1007/s11701-015-0506-3 [doi]
AB  - Achalasia is a debilitating esophageal motility disorder characterized by 
      incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and lack of peristalsis. 
      Manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis and laparoscopic Heller myotomy has 
      been the gold standard for definitive therapy. However, current advances in 
      surgical technology have introduced the robotic platform as a viable approach for 
      this procedure. The safety and efficacy has been clearly established with 
      comparable operative times to laparoscopy in experienced hands. Importantly, the 
      rate of resolution of dysphagia postoperatively is over 80% which is comparable 
      to laparoscopic outcomes. Moreover, some literature suggests lower esophageal 
      perforation rates utilizing the robotic platform. Nevertheless, costs remain one 
      of the largest barriers to widespread use of the robotic platform and future 
      studies should aim to identify strategies in cost reduction.

TI  - Recurrent intussusception in a gastric bypass patient with incidental Meckel's 
      diverticulum: A case report.
PG  - 271-2
LID - 10.4103/0972-9941.158158 [doi]
AB  - Most cases of intussusception in adults are secondary to a pathologic condition 
      that serves as a lead point. Intussusception has been reported in the bariatric 
      literature, typically due to intussusception of the jejunojejunostomy. However, 
      other causes of intussusception should be considered, including a Meckel's 
      diverticulum (MD). Simple diverticulectomy or segmental resection is the 
      preferred treatment since the malignancy rate is low. We present an interesting 
      case of a patient with past surgical history of open Roux-en-Y gastric bypass who 
      presented with intussusception. Intraoperatively, an MD was encountered and 
      treated with diverticulectomy. 4 months later, she re-presented with recurrent 
      intussusception and was subsequently taken back to the operating room for 
      revision of her jejunojejunostomy. The postoperative course was uncomplicated.

TI  - Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy: Co-morbidity Profiles and Intermediate-Term 
      Outcomes.
PG  - 1788-93
LID - 10.1007/s11695-015-2002-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bariatric surgery is effective at achieving sustained weight loss and 
      improving the control and resolution of obesity-related co-morbidities. Most 
      studies that have demonstrated co-morbidity resolution in patients undergoing 
      laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) only follow patients for the short term 
      (less than 1 year) or follow a relatively small cohort (<100 patients) for the 
      intermediate or long term (more than 5 years). We report our experience following 
      a large cohort of morbidly obese patients who underwent LSG with 
      intermediate-term follow-up. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 435 consecutive 
      patients who underwent LSG from January 2004 to November 2013. Co-morbidities 
      investigated included diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), and 
      hyperlipidemia (HL). A co-morbidity was determined to be resolved if the patient 
      was no longer taking any medication to treat that specific co-morbidity. RESULTS: 
      Mean follow-up was 26 +/- 25 months (range = 1-112). Mean postoperative total 
      weight loss (%TWL) at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 months were 23.6, 29.9, 29.5, 
      25.2, 26.7, 25.4, and 24.3 %, respectively. The incidence of all three 
      co-morbidities was found to be significantly lower at the last patient follow-up. 
      The resolution rates for DM, HTN, and HL were 59, 31, and 50 %, respectively. In 
      patients who continued to have co-morbidities, the mean numbers of medications 
      for DM (1.2 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.7, p < 0.0001), HTN (1.8 +/- 1.1 vs. 1.3 +/- 1.2, 
      p < 0.0001), and HL (0.9 +/- 0.7 vs. 0.6 +/- 0.6, p < 0.0001) postoperatively were 
      all significantly less. CONCLUSIONS: LSG is effective at achieving significant 
      and sustained weight loss, improvement in co-morbidity profiles, and a reduction 
      in poly-pharmacy for these conditions over intermediate-term follow-up.

TI  - PTSD SYMPTOMS ACROSS PREGNANCY AND EARLY POSTPARTUM AMONG WOMEN WITH LIFETIME 
      PTSD DIAGNOSIS.
PG  - 584-91
LID - 10.1002/da.22465 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about trajectories of PTSD symptoms across the 
      peripartum period in women with trauma histories, specifically those who met 
      lifetime PTSD diagnoses prior to pregnancy. The present study seeks to identify 
      factors that influence PTSD symptom load across pregnancy and early postpartum, 
      and study its impact on postpartum adaptation. METHOD: The current study is a 
      secondary analysis on pregnant women with a Lifetime PTSD diagnosis (N = 319) 
      derived from a larger community sample who were interviewed twice across 
      pregnancy (28 and 35 weeks) and again at 6 weeks postpartum, assessing 
      socioeconomic risks, mental health, past and ongoing trauma exposure, and 
      adaptation to postpartum. RESULTS: Using trajectory analysis, first we examined 
      the natural course of PTSD symptoms based on patterns across peripartum, and 
      found four distinct trajectory groups. Second, we explored factors (demographic, 
      historical, and gestational) that shape the PTSD symptom trajectories, and 
      examined the impact of trajectory membership on maternal postpartum adaptation. 
      We found that child abuse history, demographic risk, and lifetime PTSD symptom 
      count increased pregnancy-onset PTSD risk, whereas gestational PTSD symptom 
      trajectory was best predicted by interim trauma and labor anxiety. Women with the 
      greatest PTSD symptom rise during pregnancy were most likely to suffer postpartum 
      depression and reported greatest bonding impairment with their infants at 6 weeks 
      postpartum. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for modifiable risks (interpersonal trauma 
      exposure and labor anxiety) and /or PTSD symptom load during pregnancy appears 
      critical to promote maternal wellbeing.

AB  - Worry, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms are dimensions that have each been 
      linked to heterogeneous problems in interpersonal functioning. However, the 
      relationships between these symptoms and interpersonal difficulties remain 
      unclear given that most studies have examined diagnostic categories, not 
      accounted for symptoms' shared variability due to general distress, and 
      investigated only interpersonal problems (neglecting interpersonal traits, 
      interpersonal goals, social behavior in daily life, and reports of significant 
      others). To address these issues, students (Study 1; N=282) endorsed symptoms and 
      interpersonal circumplex measures of traits and problems, as well as 
      event-contingent social behaviors during one week of naturalistic daily 
      interactions (N=184; 7,036 records). Additionally, depressed and anxious patients 
      (N=47) reported symptoms and interpersonal goals in a dyadic relationship, and 
      significant others rated patients' interpersonal goals and impact (Study 2). We 
      derived hypotheses about prototypical interpersonal features from theories about 
      the functions of particular symptoms and social behaviors. As expected, worry was 
      uniquely associated with prototypically affiliative tendencies across all 
      self-report measures in both samples, but predicted impacting significant others 
      in unaffiliative ways. As also hypothesized, social anxiety was uniquely and 
      prototypically associated with low dominance across measures, and general 
      distress was associated with cold-submissive tendencies. Findings for depressive 
      symptoms provided less consistent evidence for unique prototypical interpersonal 
      features. Overall, results suggest the importance of multimethod assessment and 
      accounting for general distress in interpersonal models of worry, social anxiety, 
      and depressive symptoms.

TI  - Enabling the participation of marginalized populations: case studies from a 
      health service organization in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 636-649
LID - 10.1093/heapro/dav118 [doi]
AB  - We examined efforts to engage marginalized populations in Ontario Community 
      Health Centers (CHCs), which are primary health care organizations serving 74 
      high-risk communities. Qualitative case studies of community participation in 
      four Ontario CHCs were carried out through key informant interviews with CHC 
      staff to identify: (i) the approaches, strategies and methods used in 
      participation initiatives aimed specifically at engaging marginalized populations 
      in the planning of and decision making for health services; and (ii) the 
      challenges and enablers for engaging these populations. The marginalized 
      populations involved in the community participation initiatives studied included 
      Low-German Speaking Mennonites in a rural town, newcomer immigrants and refugees 
      in an urban downtown city, immigrant and francophone seniors in an inner city and 
      refugee women in an inner city. Our analysis revealed that enabling the 
      participation of marginalized populations requires CHCs to attend to the barriers 
      experienced by marginalized populations that constrain their participation. Key 
      informants outlined the features of a 'community development approach' that they 
      rely on to address the barriers to marginalized peoples' involvement by 
      strengthening their skills, abilities and leadership in capacity-building 
      activities. The community development approach also shaped the participation 
      methods that were used in the engagement process of CHCs. However, key informants 
      also described the challenges of applying this approach, influenced by the 
      cultural values of some groups, which shaped their willingness and motivation to 
      participate. This study provides further insight into the approach, strategies 
      and methods used in the engagement process to enable the participation of 
      marginalized populations, which may be transferable to other health services 
      settings.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease: A review of surgical decision making.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v8.i1.77 [doi]
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disorder with increasing 
      prevalence. It is estimated that up to 20%-25% of Americans experience symptoms 
      of GERD weekly. Excessive reflux of acidic often with alkaline bile salt gastric 
      and duodenal contents results in a multitude of symptoms for the patient 
      including heartburn, regurgitation, cough, and dysphagia. There are also 
      associated complications of GERD including erosive esophagitis, Barrett's 
      esophagus, stricture and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. While first line 
      treatments for GERD involve mainly lifestyle and non-surgical therapies, surgical 
      interventions have proven to be effective in appropriate circumstances. 
      Anti-reflux operations are aimed at creating an effective barrier to reflux at 
      the gastroesophageal junction and thus attempt to improve physiologic and 
      mechanical issues that may be involved in the pathogenesis of GERD. The decision 
      for surgical intervention in the treatment of GERD, moreover, requires an 
      objective confirmation of the diagnosis. Confirmation is achieved using various 
      preoperative evaluations including: ambulatory pH monitoring, esophageal 
      manometry, upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and barium swallow. Upon 
      confirmation of the diagnosis and with appropriate patient criteria met, an 
      anti-reflux operation is a good alternative to prolonged medical therapy. 
      Currently, minimally invasive gastro-esophageal fundoplication is the gold 
      standard for surgical intervention of GERD. Our review outlines the many factors 
      that are involved in surgical decision-making. We will review the prominent 
      features that reflect appropriate anti-reflux surgery and present suggestions 
      that are pertinent to surgical practices, based on evidence-based studies.

TI  - Prevalence of DSM-IV intermittent explosive disorder in Black adolescents: 
      Findings from the National Survey of American Life, Adolescent Supplement.
PG  - 552-63
LID - 10.1037/ort0000170 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the epidemiology of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
      Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV) intermittent explosive disorder (IED) in 
      adolescents, and no information is currently available regarding the relationship 
      between race/ethnicity and IED among Black youth in the United States. Using the 
      World Health Organization World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic 
      Interview (Adolescent Version), we estimated the prevalence, severity, and 
      disability of IED in a national, probability sample of African American and 
      Caribbean Black youth (ages 13-17) from the National Survey of American Life, 
      Adolescent Supplement. Face-to-face surveys of 810 African American and 360 
      Caribbean Black youth were conducted between 2001 and 2003. We calculated 
      lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of IED using diagnostic algorithms based on 
      DSM-IV and assessed IED disability using a modified Sheehan Disability Scale. 
      Overall findings indicated lifetime and 12-month IED prevalence rates of 9.2% and 
      7.0%, respectively. Lifetime prevalence rates of IED were 9.0% for African 
      American and 12.4% for Caribbean Black teens. Within the past 12 months, 6.7% of 
      African American and 11.5% of Caribbean Black adolescents met diagnostic criteria 
      for IED. Lifetime and 12-month IED were associated with anxiety disorders. In 
      addition, few teens with lifetime IED received any treatment. Findings are 
      consistent with recent evidence that intermittent explosive disorder may be more 
      common than previously considered, especially among adolescents. Significant acts 
      of aggression and impairment are associated with IED, and low treatment rates 
      indicate that more research on this disorder and intervention options is 
      warranted.

TI  - Ethnic and Gender Differences in Help Seeking for Substance Disorders Among Black 
      Americans.
PG  - 308-316
LID - 10.1007/s40615-016-0230-3 [doi]
AB  - This paper uses the National Survey of American Life (NSAL) to examine within 
      group differences regarding help-seeking for substance disorders among a US 
      sample of African American and Caribbean Black men and women. We examined ethnic 
      and gender differences in the type of providers sought for substance disorder 
      treatment, as well as reasons for avoiding treatment. Results indicate that 
      overall, few ethnic differences exist; however, African Americans are more likely 
      than Caribbean Blacks to seek help from human service professionals (including a 
      religious or spiritual advisor) and from informal sources of treatment such as 
      self-help groups. Black men with a substance disorder were more likely to see a 
      psychiatrist than Black women. Findings regarding reasons for avoiding treatment 
      suggest that there may be a need to provide better education about the utility of 
      substance disorder treatment, even before problems reach a high level of 
      severity.

LID - 10.1016/j.psychres.2016.02.069 [doi]
AB  - The Penn State Worry Questionnaire - Past Week (PSWQ-PW) is an adaptation of the 
      widely used Penn State Worry Questionnaire, measuring pathological worry weekly. 
      However, it contains problematic negatively worded items and has not been 
      validated in a large sample yet. To meet the needs of measurement-based care 
      (MBC), we developed a shortened version (PSWQ-10) based on the PSWQ-PW, retaining 
      only positively worded items, and examined its psychometric properties and 
      clinical utility. Patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Major 
      Depressive Disorder (MDD), and other anxiety disorders completed the PSWQ-10 and 
      other instruments during routine evaluation in an academic anxiety clinic. A 
      second cohort from a perinatal clinic was evaluated similarly. The PSWQ-10 
      displayed excellent internal consistency, convergent and discriminant validity, 
      and criterion group validity. Patients with GAD scored significantly higher than 
      those with other anxiety disorders but did not differ from those with MDD. The 
      PSWQ-10 showed sensitivity to change over time and demonstrated excellent 
      psychometric properties in the perinatal population. The PSWQ-10 is a reliable, 
      valid, efficient, and straightforward worry-focused instrument that can be 
      readily used in MBC and help clinicians objectively measure worry as a treatment 
      outcome in broad clinical populations.

TI  - Comparison of Open, Laparoscopic, and Robotic Colectomies Using a Large National 
      Database: Outcomes and Trends Related to Surgery Center Volume.
PG  - 535-42
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000000580 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that high-volume centers and laparoscopic 
      techniques improve outcomes of colectomy. These evidence-based measures have been 
      slow to be accepted, and current trends are unknown. In addition, the current 
      rates and outcomes of robotic surgery are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study was to examine current national trends in the use of minimally invasive 
      surgery and to evaluate hospital volume trends over time. DESIGN: This was a 
      retrospective study. SETTINGS: This study was conducted in a tertiary referral 
      hospital. PATIENTS: Using the National Inpatient Sample, we evaluated trends in 
      patients undergoing elective open, laparoscopic, and robotic colectomies from 
      2009 to 2012. Patient and institutional characteristics were evaluated and 
      outcomes compared between groups using multivariate hierarchical-logistic 
      regression and nonparametric tests. The National Inpatient Sample includes 
      patient and hospital demographics, admission and treating diagnoses, inpatient 
      procedures, in-hospital mortality, length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and 
      discharge status. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: In-hospital mortality and postoperative 
      complications of surgery were measured. RESULTS: A total of 509,029 patients 
      underwent elective colectomy from 2009 to 2012. Of those 266,263 (52.3%) were 
      open, 235,080 (46.2%) laparoscopic, and 7686 (1.5%) robotic colectomies. The 
      majority of minimal access surgery is still being performed at high-volume 
      compared with low-volume centers (37.5% vs 28.0% and 44.0% vs 23.0%; p < 0.001). 
      A total of 36% of colectomies were for cancer. The number of robotic colectomies 
      has quadrupled from 702 in 2009 to 3390 (1.1%) in 2012. After adjustment, the 
      rate of iatrogenic complications was higher for robotic surgery (OR = 1.73 (95% 
      CI, 1.20-2.47)), and the median cost of robotic surgery was higher, at $15,649 
      (interquartile range, $11,840-$20,183) vs $12,071 (interquartile range, 
      $9338-$16,203; p < 0.001 for laparoscopic). LIMITATIONS: This study may be 
      limited by selection bias by surgeons regarding the choice of patient management. 
      In addition, there are limitations in the measures of disease severity and, 
      because the database relies on billing codes, there may be inaccuracies such as 
      underreporting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the majority of colectomies in 
      the United States are still performed open, although rates of laparoscopy 
      continue to increase. There is a trend toward increased volume of laparoscopic 
      procedures at specialty centers. The role of robotics is still being defined, in 
      light of higher cost, lack of clinical benefit, and increased iatrogenic 
      complications, albeit comparable overall complications, as compared with 
      laparoscopic colectomy.

TI  - Quality Improvement-Focused Departmental Grand Rounds Reports: A Strategy to 
      Engage General Surgery Residents.
PG  - 232-6
LID - 10.4300/JGME-D-15-00179.1 [doi]
AB  - Background Many institutions are seeking ways to enhance their surgical trainees' 
      quality improvement (QI) skills. Objective To educate trainees about the 
      importance of lifelong performance improvement, chief residents at New York 
      Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medicine are members of a multidisciplinary 
      QI team tasked with improving surgical outcomes. We describe the process and the 
      results of this effort. Methods Our analysis used 2 data sources to assess 
      complication rates: the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) and 
      ECOMP, our own internal complication database. Chief residents met with a 
      multidisciplinary QI team to review complication rates from both data sources. 
      Chief residents performed a case-by-case analysis of complications and a 
      literature search in areas requiring improvement. Based on this information, 
      chief residents met with the multidisciplinary team to select interventions for 
      implementation, and delivered QI-focused grand rounds summarizing the QI process 
      and new interventions. Results Since 2009, chief residents have presented 16 
      QI-focused grand rounds. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and surgical site 
      infections (SSIs) were the most frequently discussed. Interventions to improve 
      UTIs and SSIs were introduced to the department of surgery through these reports 
      in 2011 and 2012. During this time we saw improvement in outcomes as measured by 
      NSQIP odds ratio. Conclusions Departmental grand rounds are a suitable forum to 
      review NSQIP data and our internal, resident-collected data as a means to engage 
      chief residents in QI improvement, and can serve as a model for other 
      institutions to engage surgery residents in QI projects.

TI  - Substance Abuse Among Blacks Across the Diaspora.
PG  - 1147-58
LID - 10.3109/10826084.2016.1160124 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower rates of substance abuse are found among Black Americans 
      compared to Whites, but little is known about differences in substance abuse 
      across ethnic groups within the black population. OBJECTIVES: We examined 
      prevalence rates of substance abuse among Blacks across three geographic regions 
      (US, Jamaica, Guyana). The study also sought to ascertain whether length of time, 
      national context and major depressive episodes (MDE) were associated with 
      substance abuse. METHODS: We utilized three different data sources based upon 
      probability samples collected in three different countries. The samples included 
      3,570 African Americans and 1,621 US Caribbean Black adults from the 2001-2003 
      National Survey of American Life (NSAL). An additional 1,142 Guyanese Blacks and 
      1,176 Jamaican Blacks living in the Caribbean region were included from the 2005 
      NSAL replication extension study, Family Connections Across Generations and 
      Nations (FCGN). Mental disorders were based upon DSM-IV criteria. For the 
      analysis, we used descriptive statistics, chi-square, and multivariate logistic 
      regression analytic procedures. RESULTS: Prevalence of substance abuse varied by 
      national context, with higher rates among Blacks within the United States 
      compared to the Caribbean region. Rates of substance abuse were lower overall for 
      women, but differ across cohorts by nativity and length of time in the United 
      States, and in association with major depressive episode. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      highlights the need for further examination of how substance abuse disparities 
      between US-based and Caribbean-based populations may become manifested.

AB  - BACKGROUND: National adoption of sphincter-preserving surgery (SPS) and minimally 
      invasive surgery (MIS) has not been well documented. We examined national trends 
      in use of SPS and MIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample was 
      used to evaluate open, laparoscopic, and robotic low anterior resection (LAR) or 
      abdominoperineal resection (APR) for patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery 
      from 2009 to 2011. Trends in SPS and MIS were stratified by hospital volume. 
      Propensity score matching was used. RESULTS: A total of 24,999 (62.0%) patients 
      underwent LAR, and 15,288 (38.0%) underwent APR from 2009 to 2011. A total of 
      22,310 (89.2%) LARs were open and 2689 (10.8%) MIS. A total of 11,600 (75.9%) 
      APRs were open and 3688 (24.1%) MIS. Most procedures were at high-volume centers. 
      In propensity-matched analysis, length of stay for LAR was longer in open surgery 
      (6 versus 5 d; P = 0.01); in APR, MIS patients were less likely to have wound, 
      infectious, urinary, and gastrointestinal complications, and length of stay was 
      shorter (6 versus 8 d; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: SPS and MIS rates have increased 
      nationally, especially in high-volume centers. In addition, the perioperative 
      benefits seen in randomized clinical trials are maintained in a national 
      database. Further studies should focus on understanding differences in survival 
      and oncologic outcomes with MIS techniques.

TI  - Why do policies change? Institutions, interests, ideas and networks in three 
      cases of policy reform.
PG  - 1200-11
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czw052 [doi]
AB  - Policy researchers have used various categories of variables to explain why 
      policies change, including those related to institutions, interests and ideas. 
      Recent research has paid growing attention to the role of policy networks-the 
      actors involved in policy-making, their relationships with each other, and the 
      structure formed by those relationships-in policy reform across settings and 
      issues; however, this literature has largely ignored the theoretical integration 
      of networks with other policy theories, including the '3Is' of institutions, 
      interests and ideas. This article proposes a conceptual framework integrating 
      these variables and tests it on three cases of policy change in Burkina Faso, 
      addressing the need for theoretical integration with networks as well as the 
      broader aim of theory-driven health policy analysis research in low- and 
      middle-income countries. We use historical process tracing, a type of comparative 
      case study, to interpret and compare documents and in-depth interview data within 
      and between cases. We found that while network changes were indeed associated 
      with policy reform, this relationship was mediated by one or more of 
      institutions, interests and ideas. In a context of high donor dependency, new 
      donor rules affected the composition and structure of actors in the networks, 
      which enabled the entry and dissemination of new ideas and shifts in the overall 
      balance of interest power ultimately leading to policy change. The case of 
      strategic networking occurred in only one case, by civil society actors, 
      suggesting that network change is rarely the spark that initiates the process 
      towards policy change. This analysis highlights the important role of changes in 
      institutions and ideas to drive policymaking, but hints that network change is a 
      necessary intermediate step in these processes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the population ages, an increasing number of older patients are 
      undergoing major surgery. We examined the impact of advanced age on outcomes 
      following major gastrointestinal cancer surgery in an era of improved surgical 
      outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective 
      cohort study using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality 
      Improvement Program database. We evaluated patients undergoing major abdominal 
      gastrointestinal cancer surgery from 2005-2012. Multivariable logistic regression 
      was performed to determine the independent effect of advanced age on outcomes. 
      Our primary outcome was 30-d mortality, and our secondary outcomes were 30-d 
      major postoperative adverse events, discharge disposition, length of stay, 
      reoperation, and readmission. RESULTS: Elderly (>/=65 y) patients were twice as 
      likely to have multiple comorbidities as those <65 y but prevalence of 
      comorbidities was similar across all older age groups. Mortality increased with 
      age across all procedures (P < 0.05). The risk of advanced age on mortality was 
      highest in hepatectomy (odds ratio = 5.17, 95% confidence interval = 2.19-12.20) 
      and that for major postoperative adverse events was highest in proctectomy (odds 
      ratio = 2.32, 95% confidence interval = 1.53-3.52). Patients were more likely to 
      be discharged to an institutional care facility as age increased across all 
      procedures (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Despite being highly selected for surgery, 
      elderly patients undergoing major gastrointestinal cancer surgery have 
      substantially worse postoperative outcomes than younger patients (<65 y). The 
      risk of age on postoperative outcomes was present across all operations but had 
      its highest association with liver and rectal cancer resections.

AB  - Individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) typically exhibit altered 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function and sympathetic nervous system 
      (SNS) activity. The goals of this study were to determine whether HPA and SNS 
      alterations in the immediate aftermath of trauma predict subsequent PTSD symptom 
      development and whether inconsistencies observed between studies can be explained 
      by key demographic and methodological factors. This work informs secondary 
      prevention of PTSD by identifying subgroups of trauma survivors at risk for PTSD. 
      This meta-analysis (26 studies, N=5186 individuals) revealed that higher heart 
      rate measured soon after trauma exposure was associated with higher PTSD symptoms 
      subsequently (r=0.13). Neither cortisol (r=-0.07) nor blood pressure (diastolic: 
      r=-0.01; systolic: r=0.02) were associated with PTSD symptoms which may be 
      influenced by methodological limitations. Associations between risk markers 
      (heart rate, cortisol, systolic blood pressure) and PTSD symptoms were in the 
      positive direction for younger samples and negative direction for older samples. 
      These findings extend developmental traumatology models of PTSD by revealing an 
      age-related shift in the presentation of early risk markers. More work will be 
      needed to identify risk markers and pathways to PTSD while addressing 
      methodological limitations in order to shape and target preventive interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There have been many efforts to increase the number of women 
      surgeons. We provide an update of women surgeon representation along the pathway 
      to surgical academia. METHODS: Data was extracted from Association of American 
      Medical Colleges FACTS and Faculty Administrative Management Online User System 
      as well as GME annual reports starting in 1994 until the last year available for 
      each. RESULTS: The proportion of graduating women medical students has increased 
      on average .5% per year from 1994 to 2014. Women general surgery trainees have 
      more than doubled in number over the same period but represented 38.3% of all 
      general surgery trainees in 2014. Women Full Professors increased on average .3% 
      from 1994 to 2015 but still make up less than 10% of all Full Professors. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Despite improvements over the past 20 years, there are still large 
      gender gaps in surgery for trainees and academic leadership. At the current rate 
      of increase, women Full Professors will not achieve gender parity until in 2136.

TI  - Development of a Nonparametric Predictive Model for Readmission Risk in Elderly 
      Adults After Colon and Rectal Cancer Surgery.
PG  - e125-e130
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14448 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary objective: to use advanced nonparametric techniques to 
      determine risk factors for readmission after colorectal cancer surgery in elderly 
      adults. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: to compare this methodology with traditional 
      parametric methods. DESIGN: Using data from the American College of Surgeons 
      National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP), nonparametric techniques 
      were used to evaluate the risk of readmission in elderly adults undergoing 
      surgery for colorectal cancer in 2011 and 2012. SETTING: More than 200 hospitals 
      participating in the NSQIP database. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older 
      who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer in 2011 and 2012 (N = 2,117). 
      MEASUREMENTS: Age-stratified robust nonparametric predictive model 
      (classification and regression tree (CART) analysis) of 30-day readmission for 
      elderly adults undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Recent 
      chemotherapy was the most important predictor of readmission in participants aged 
      65 to 74, with 20% of those with recent chemotherapy and 11% of with no recent 
      chemotherapy being readmitted. Participants aged 75 to 84 who had recently 
      undergone chemotherapy had a readmission rate of 23%, whereas those with no 
      chemotherapy had a readmission rate of 9%. Being underweight was the greatest 
      predictor of readmission (30%) in participants aged 85 and older. These methods 
      were found to be more robust than traditional logistic regression. CONCLUSION: 
      Specific age-related preoperative factors help predict readmission in elderly 
      adults undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. Results of the nonparametric CART 
      analysis are better than traditional regression analysis and help physicians to 
      clinically stratify based on age. This model may help identify individuals in 
      whom intervention may be helpful in reducing readmission after surgery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: No simple way to augment fear extinction has been established. 
      Cortisol has shown to enhance memory extinction and preliminary evidence suggest 
      that extinction learning maybe more successful in the morning when cortisol is 
      high. The aim was to determine whether exposure sessions conducted earlier in the 
      day are associated with superior therapeutic gains in extinction-based 
      psychotherapy. We also examined the role of cortisol levels as a mediator between 
      time of day and therapeutic gains. METHOD: Participants were 24 individuals 
      meeting DSM-IV criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia. Participants 
      received 3 weekly in-vivo exposure sessions, yielding 72 total sessions for 
      analysis of time of day effects. Session start times were evenly distributed 
      across the day. The outcome measures were reductions in panic symptom severity 
      (avoidance behaviors, threat misappraisal, perceived control, and panic disorder 
      symptom severity). RESULTS: Sessions starting earlier in the day were associated 
      with superior therapeutic gains by the next therapy session. Earlier sessions 
      were also associated with higher pre-exposure cortisol levels, which in turn were 
      related to greater clinical improvement by the next session. Cortisol thus was 
      found to mediate the effect of time of day on subsequent outcome, providing a 
      link between earlier exposure sessions and greater clinical improvement. 
      CONCLUSION: The data suggest that early-day extinction-based therapy sessions 
      yield better outcomes than later-day sessions, partly due to the enhancing effect 
      of higher cortisol levels.

TI  - PUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: A FRAMEWORK FOR 
      ACTION.
PG  - 256-264
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As health technology assessment (HTA) organizations in Canada and 
      around the world seek to involve the public and patients in their activities, 
      frameworks to guide decisions about whom to involve, through which mechanisms, 
      and at what stages of the HTA process have been lacking. The aim of this study 
      was to describe the development and outputs of a comprehensive framework for 
      involving the public and patients in a government agency's HTA process. METHODS: 
      The framework was informed by a synthesis of international practice and published 
      literature, a dialogue with local, national and international stakeholders, and 
      the deliberations of a government agency's public engagement subcommittee in 
      Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: The practice and literature synthesis failed to 
      identify a single, optimal approach to involving the public and patients in HTA. 
      Choice of methods should be considered in the context of each HTA stage, goals 
      for incorporating societal and/or patient perspectives into the process, and 
      relevant societal and/or patient values at stake. The resulting framework is 
      structured around four actionable elements: (i) guiding principles and goals for 
      public and patient involvement (PPI) in HTA, (ii) the establishment of a common 
      language to support PPI efforts, (iii) a flexible array of PPI approaches, and 
      (iv) on-going evaluation of PPI to inform adjustments over time. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      public and patient involvement framework has been developed for implementation in 
      a government agency's HTA process. Core elements of this framework may apply to 
      other organizations responsible for HTA and health system quality improvement.

TI  - The Impact of Biliopancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch (BPD/DS) Over 
      9 Years.
PG  - 787-794
LID - 10.1007/s11695-016-2371-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on the multiple long-term effects of the 
      biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (BPD/DS). METHODS: Patients who 
      consented to a BPD/DS from 1999 to 2010 were evaluated for weight change, 
      complications, comorbidity resolution, body composition, quality of life, and 
      depressive symptoms during visits at 1, 3,5, 7, and 9 years. Descriptive 
      statistics, analysis of variance, and pair-wise comparisons were calculated for 
      each of the five follow-up cohorts vs. the baseline cohort. RESULTS: Between 1999 
      and 2010, 284 patients received a BPD/DS; 275 patients (69.8 % women) age 
      42.7 years, BMI 53.4 kg/m(2) qualified for baseline analysis. Two hundred 
      seventy-five patients were available in year 1; 275 patients in year 3; 273 
      patients in year 5; 259 patients in year 7; and 228 patients in year 9. Gender 
      distribution was not different. BMI was 30.1 at 1 year and 32.0 at 9 years. Body 
      fat was reduced to 26 % after 2 years. Complications requiring surgery were 
      significant. Nutritional problems developed in 29.8 % of patients over the course 
      of observation. The baseline Beck Depression Index (BDI) was 13.9 and 7.2 in year 
      1. Year 1 through 9 remained unchanged. There were significant positive changes 
      in quality of life between baseline and year 1 for most domains. These positive 
      changes were maintained for the follow-up cohorts. After surgery the resolution 
      of comorbidities continued for the 9 years. CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss during the 
      first year was well maintained, resolving comorbidities and improving quality of 
      life. Rates of surgical complications resemble other bariatric procedures. 
      Long-term nutrient deficiencies are of concern.

AB  - Progress in clinical and affective neuroscience is redefining psychiatric illness 
      as symptomatic expression of cellular/molecular dysfunctions in specific brain 
      circuits. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been an exemplar of this 
      progress, with improved understanding of neurobiological systems subserving fear 
      learning, salience detection, and emotion regulation explaining much of its 
      phenomenology and neurobiology. However, many features remain unexplained and a 
      parsimonious model that more fully accounts for symptoms and the core 
      neurobiology remains elusive. Contextual processing is a key modulatory function 
      of hippocampal-prefrontal-thalamic circuitry, allowing organisms to disambiguate 
      cues and derive situation-specific meaning from the world. We propose that 
      dysregulation within this context-processing circuit is at the core of PTSD 
      pathophysiology, accounting for much of its phenomenology and most of its 
      biological findings. Understanding core mechanisms like this, and their 
      underlying neural circuits, will sharpen diagnostic precision and understanding 
      of risk factors, enhancing our ability to develop preventive and "personalized" 
      interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is a large body of published data demonstrating 
      improved outcomes for complex operations when performed by high-volume surgeons 
      at high-volume hospitals, the literature is mixed regarding whether this same 
      relationship applies in less complex and more common surgeries such as 
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy. METHODS: This study utilized the New York State 
      Department of Health Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database 
      to identify patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy for acute and 
      chronic biliary pathology. Rates of perioperative outcomes were compared among 4 
      distinct categories of surgeons based on surgeon annual and cumulative volume: 
      low cumulative/low annual, low cumulative/high annual, high cumulative/low 
      annual, and high cumulative/high annual. RESULTS: A total of 150,938 patients 
      undergoing operation by 3,306 surgeons at 250 hospitals across New York state 
      were included for analysis from 2000-2014. There was no difference in adjusted 
      30-day in-hospital mortality, major events, procedural complications, bile duct 
      injury, or reintervention rates between the 4 groups of surgeons. However, 
      patients undergoing operation by high cumulative/high annual volume surgeons were 
      less likely to experience 30-day readmission, prolonged duration of stay, and 
      high charges when compared with low cumulative/low annual volume surgeons. 
      CONCLUSION: In New York state, increased surgeon annual and cumulative volume 
      predicts lower rates of 30-day readmission, prolonged duration of stay, and high 
      charges in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but has no effect on in-hospital 
      mortality, major events, bile duct injury, procedural complications, or 
      reintervention. There is no evidence to support regionalization of this procedure 
      as operative outcomes are comparable even in less experienced hands.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a wide range of health system performance indicators are 
      commonly reported on, there has been little effort to establish their relevance 
      to the objectives that health systems actually pursue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to identify, explore and better understand health policy makers' views 
      regarding the objectives and outcomes for their health systems, how they are 
      prioritized, and the underlying processes that yield them to inform the 
      development of health system efficiency measures. METHODS: A descriptive, 
      qualitative methodology was employed using key informant interviews with 17 
      current and former senior health ministry officials in 8 Canadian provinces and 2 
      territories. KEY FINDINGS: Health ministries have clearly stated objectives for 
      health systems focused on the achievement of health system delivery and 
      population health goals and, increasingly, public, patient and financial 
      accountability. Acute care objectives are routinely prioritized over population 
      health objectives and viewed as resulting from challenges associated with 
      difficult trade-off decisions shaped by organized interests and the media rather 
      than explicit, evidence-based processes. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights 
      beyond publicly available documents to explore the processes that underlie simple 
      statements of health system objectives. Our findings suggest that despite 
      respondents giving priority to improving individual and population health, it is 
      more commonly portrayed as an ideal objective than as a realistic one. By 
      understanding what lies behind statements about what health systems are striving 
      for, we offer a more robust avenue for increasing the uptake of future studies of 
      health system performance.

TI  - Surgeon Annual and Cumulative Volumes Predict Early Postoperative Outcomes after 
      Rectal Cancer Resection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine if 5-year surgeon cumulative and annual volumes predict 
      improved early postoperative outcomes in patients with rectal cancer. BACKGROUND: 
      Operative experience has been shown to effect surgical outcomes. The differential 
      role of cumulative versus annual volume has not yet been explored for rectal 
      surgery. METHODS: The Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database 
      was used to capture patients undergoing surgery in New York State from 2000 to 
      2013. A population-based sample of patients undergoing major rectal or 
      rectosigmoid resection as their principal procedure during hospitalization 
      between 2000 and 2013 were identified using International Classification of 
      Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification procedure codes. Surgeons were 
      identified using a unique physician number from 1995 to 2013. RESULTS: The 
      percentage of surgeries performed by high cumulative/high annual (HC/HA) surgeons 
      increased from 38.3% to 58.4% (P < 0.01) with a simultaneous decrease in that 
      performed by low cumulative/low annual (LC/LA) surgeons (52.5% to 29.8%, P < 
      0.01). HC/HA volume surgeons had a significantly lower rate of surgical 
      complications (odd ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval = 0.60-0.83, P < 0.05) 
      as compared with LC/LA volume surgeons. There was no significant difference in 
      rates of anastomotic leak, nonroutine discharges or readmission among all four 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The best early postoperative surgical outcomes are achieved 
      in centers where there are high cumulative and high annual volume surgeons caring 
      for these patients. This suggests the need for specialized designation of rectal 
      cancer centers to support ongoing regionalization of care.

AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by excessive absorption with 
      internally-generated distressing thoughts and urges, with difficulty 
      incorporating external information running counter to their fears and concerns. 
      In the present study, we experimentally probed this core feature of OCD through 
      the use of a novel attention switching task that investigates transitions between 
      internally focused (IF) and externally focused (EF) attentional states. Eighteen 
      OCD patients and 18 controls imagined positive and negative personal event 
      scenarios (IF state) or performed a color-word Stroop task (EF state). The IF/EF 
      states were followed by a target detection (TD) task requiring responses to 
      external stimuli. Compared to controls, OCD patients made significantly more 
      errors and showed reduced activation of superior and inferior occipital cortex, 
      thalamus, and putamen during TD following negative IF, with the inferior 
      occipital hypoactivation being significantly greater for TD following negative IF 
      compared to TD following the other conditions. Patients showed stronger 
      functional connectivity between the inferior occipital region and dorsomedial 
      prefrontal cortex. These findings point to an OCD-related impairment in the 
      visual processing of external stimuli specifically when they follow a period of 
      negative internal focus, and suggest that future treatments may wish to target 
      the transition between attentional states.

TI  - Neural circuitry of emotion regulation: Effects of appraisal, attention, and 
      cortisol administration.
PG  - 437-451
LID - 10.3758/s13415-016-0489-1 [doi]
AB  - Psychosocial well-being requires effective regulation of emotional responding in 
      context of threat or stress. Neuroimaging studies have focused on instructed, 
      volitional regulation (e.g., reappraisal or distancing), largely ignoring 
      implicit regulation that does not involve purposeful effort to alter emotional 
      experience. These implicit processes may or may not involve the same neural 
      pathways as explicit regulatory strategies. We examined the neurobiology of 
      implicit emotional regulation processes and the impact of the stress hormone 
      cortisol on these processes. Our study task employed composite pictures of faces 
      and places to examine neural activity during implicit emotional processing (of 
      emotional faces), while these responses were implicitly regulated by attention 
      shift away from the emotionally evocative stimuli, and while subjects 
      reflectively appraised their own emotional response to them. Subjects completed 
      the task in an fMRI scanner after random assignment to receive placebo or 
      hydrocortisone (HCT), an orally administered version of cortisol. Implicit 
      emotional processing activated insula/IFG, dACC/dMPFC, midbrain and amygdala. 
      With attention shifting, we saw diminished signal in emotion generating/response 
      regions (e.g., amygdala) and increased activations in task specific attention 
      regions like parahippocampus. With appraisal of emotions, we observed robust 
      activations in medial prefrontal areas, where activation is also seen in 
      instructed reappraisal studies. We observed no main effects of HCT administration 
      on brain, but males and females showed opposing neural effects in prefrontal 
      areas. The data suggest that different types of emotion regulation utilize 
      overlapping circuits, but with some strategy specific activation. Further study 
      of the dimorphic sex response to cortisol is needed.

TI  - Primary Care Performance Measurement and Reporting at a Regional Level: Could a 
      Matrix Approach Provide Actionable Information for Policy Makers and Clinicians?
PG  - 33-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary care services form the foundation of modern healthcare 
      systems, yet the breadth and complexity of services and diversity of patient 
      populations may present challenges for creating comprehensive primary care 
      information systems. Our objective is to develop regional-level information on 
      the performance of primary care in Canada. METHODS: A scoping review was 
      conducted to identify existing initiatives in primary care performance 
      measurement and reporting across 11 countries. The results of this review were 
      used by our international team of primary care researchers and clinicians to 
      propose an approach for regional-level primary care reporting. RESULTS: We found 
      a gap between conceptual primary care performance measurement frameworks in the 
      peer-reviewed literature and real-world primary care performance measurement and 
      reporting activities. We did not find a conceptual framework or analytic approach 
      that could readily form the foundation of a regional-level primary care 
      information system. Therefore, we propose an approach to reporting comprehensive 
      and actionable performance information according to widely accepted core domains 
      of primary care as well as different patient population groups. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      approach that bridges the gap between conceptual frameworks and real-world 
      performance measurement and reporting initiatives could address some of the 
      potential pitfalls of existing ways of presenting performance information (i.e., 
      by single diseases or by age). This approach could produce meaningful and 
      actionable information on the quality of primary care services.

PG  - 429-435
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2016.5043 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Colonic stenting was introduced for palliation of malignant 
      large-bowel obstruction (MLBO) more than 20 years ago but remains controversial. 
      OBJECTIVE: To compare outcomes after palliative stenting vs stoma creation in 
      patients with MLBO requiring emergency management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study assessed 345 patients from New York 
      State with an urgent or emergency admission to the hospital for obstruction 
      secondary to colorectal cancer and who underwent stenting or stoma creation from 
      October 1, 2009, through December 31, 2013. Patients were excluded if they 
      underwent resection within 1 year of the index admission. EXPOSURES: Palliative 
      stenting vs stoma creation. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included 
      subsequent operation and readmission within 90-day and 1-year follow-up. 
      Secondary outcomes were in-hospital death, major medical and surgical 
      complications, length of stay, total charges, and discharge dispositions. 
      Multivariable hierarchical analyses and propensity score matching were used to 
      compare outcomes between the exposure groups. RESULTS: The cohort included 345 
      patients (mean [SD] age, 69.9 [14.4] years in the stoma group and 70.9 [16.8] 
      years in the stent group; 87 men [50.3%] in the stoma group and 90 [52.3%] in the 
      stent group; and 114 non-Hispanic white patients [65.9%] in the stoma group and 
      90 [52.3%] in the stent group). Most patients undergoing stenting were treated at 
      high-volume (104 [60.5%]) vs medium-volume (42 [24.4%]) or low-volume (26 
      [15.1%]) hospitals (P < .001). Patients undergoing stenting were significantly 
      less likely to experience prolonged length of stay (odds ratio [OR], 0.50; 95% 
      CI, 0.26-0.97; P = .04), more likely to be discharged to their usual residence 
      (OR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.07-0.28; P < .001), and tended to have similar or fewer 
      complications (major events: OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.30-2.18; P = .68; procedural 
      complications: OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.11-1.22; P = .10). There was no significant 
      difference between the groups in terms of 90-day and 1-year readmission to the 
      hospitals (90 days: OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.49-1.78; P = .83; 1 year: OR, 0.72; 95% 
      CI, 0.38-1.37; P = .30). Subsequent operation at 90 days was also not different 
      between the groups (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 0.26-6.89; P = .72), but there was a higher 
      chance of subsequent operation at 1 year after the stenting procedure (OR, 2.93; 
      95% CI, 1.12-7.68; P = .03), with most subsequent operations being restenting. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In patients with MLBO and if resection is not part of 
      the treatment plan, stenting is safe and improves the efficiency of care with 
      obvious quality-of-life benefits. It should be offered at experienced centers, 
      and patients should be counseled regarding increased risk of subsequent stenting 
      within 1 year.

TI  - Evaluation of Trends in the Use of InterStim for Fecal Incontinence.
PG  - 133-138
LID - 10.1177/1553350616689750 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fecal incontinence (FI) represents a large source of morbidity and is 
      a challenging clinical problem to manage. InterStim was approved to treat FI in 
      2011. Little is known about its adoption. We sought to characterize patterns of 
      use of Interstim since Food and Drug Administration approval for FI. METHODS: The 
      New York State SPARCS database was used to evaluate InterStim use for FI from 
      2011 to 2014. The primary endpoint was the number of successful implantations of 
      InterStim. Secondary endpoints included device removal, median time to removal of 
      device, 90-day infection rates, and percentage of procedures performed by surgeon 
      specialty and geographic location. RESULTS: A total of 369 patients with FI 
      underwent "Stage 1" of InterStim from 2011 to 2014. A total of 302 patients 
      underwent "Stage 2," yielding a trial period failure rate of 18.2%. The majority 
      of patients who underwent successful implantation were female (87.7%) and White 
      (78.8%). Twenty-nine patients underwent device removal after a median duration of 
      147 days. Estimated risk of removal at median follow-up of 2 years was 11.8%. 
      Colorectal surgeons comprised 51.1% of all providers followed by gynecologic 
      (24.4%) and urologic surgeons (17.8%). A total of 71.7% of providers performed <5 
      procedures, while 3 of the highest volume providers performed 50.7% of all 
      procedures. CONCLUSIONS: InterStim for FI has been used by a wide variety of 
      providers in New York State although only a few high-volume providers have 
      performed the majority of procedures. White, female patients with Medicare are 
      the most common recipients of InterStim. Further work must be done to develop 
      strategies for improving access to this technology and to determine whether 
      volume relates to outcomes.

TI  - The psychology of HPA axis activation: Examining subjective emotional distress 
      and control in a phobic fear exposure model.
PG  - 189-198

LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.02.001 [doi]
AB  - The HPA axis plays a key role in mediating the effects of "stress" on health, but 
      clarifying mechanisms requires an understanding of psycho-biological linkages. 
      There has long been an implicit assumption that subjective emotional distress 
      (e.g., fear) should activate the HPA axis. Although this assumption was 
      challenged 25 years ago (Curtis, 1976), laboratory studies in humans are limited. 
      In this study we sought to replicate Curtis' findings and extend it by 
      investigating if presence or absence of stressor control shapes HPA axis 
      reactivity in a phobic fear exposure model. We recruited 19-45-year-old specific 
      phobia participants (n=32 spider/snake phobia; n=14 claustrophobia) and gradually 
      exposed them to their feared object or situation while measuring hormonal (ACTH 
      and cortisol) and subjective (emotional distress, perceived control) responses. 
      Utilizing a dyadic yoked design, we compared HPA reactivity when the pace of 
      exposure was controlled by participants to identical exposure given to matched 
      participants in the absence of control. Results showed that phobic fear exposure 
      generated intense emotional distress without a corresponding increase in HPA axis 
      activity. Although our actual manipulation of control failed to impact HPA 
      responses, perceived control during exposure was associated with lower cortisol, 
      an effect that was moderated by actual availability of stressor control. Our 
      findings replicate Curtis' findings and challenge the still common but 
      unsupported assumption that HPA axis activity reflects subjective distress. These 
      results also highlight the importance of both perceived and actual aspects of 
      stressor control in understanding what is truly "stressful" to the HPA axis 
      system.

AB  - Evidence suggests that sighs regulate stress and emotions, e.g. by facilitating 
      relief. This study aimed to investigate sigh rates during relief. In addition, 
      links between sighs, anxiety sensitivity and HPA-axis activity were explored. 
      Healthy volunteers (N=29) were presented cues predicting the valence of 
      subsequent stimuli. By sequencing cues that predicted pleasant or unpleasant 
      stimuli with or without certainty, transitions to certain pleasantness (relief) 
      or to certain unpleasantness (control) were created and compared to no 
      transitions. Salivary cortisol, anxiety sensitivity and respiration were 
      measured. Sigh frequency was significantly higher during relief than during 
      control transitions and no transition states, and higher during control 
      transitions than during no transition states. Sigh frequency increased with 
      steeper cortisol declines for high anxiety sensitive persons. Results confirm a 
      relationship between sighs and relief. In addition, results suggest that sigh 
      frequency is importantly related to HPA-axis activity, particularly in high 
      anxiety sensitive persons.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.1700390114 [doi]
AB  - Major developments in cryo-electron microscopy in the past three or four years 
      have led to the solution of a number of spliceosome structures at high 
      resolution, e.g., the fully assembled but not yet active spliceosome (Bact), the 
      spliceosome just after the first step of splicing (C), and the spliceosome 
      activated for the second step (C*). Therefore 30 years of genetics and 
      biochemistry of the spliceosome can now be interpreted at the structural level. I 
      have closely examined the RNase H domain of Prp8 in each of the structures. 
      Interestingly, the RNase H domain has different and unexpected roles in each of 
      the catalytic steps of splicing.

TI  - Simultaneous Resection for Synchronous Colorectal Liver Metastasis: the New 
      Standard of Care?
PG  - 975-982
LID - 10.1007/s11605-017-3422-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal surgical management for patients with synchronous colorectal 
      cancer liver metastasis is controversial. We provide an analysis of surgical 
      utilization and outcomes for patients presenting with synchronous colon and 
      rectal cancer liver metastasis between simultaneous and staged approaches. 
      METHODS: SPARCS database was used to follow patients undergoing surgery for 
      colorectal cancer with liver metastases from 2005 to 2014. Using International 
      Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes, we identified patients 
      undergoing staged and simultaneous resection. Our primary endpoint was major 
      events at 30-day follow-up. RESULTS: Of the patients, 1430 underwent surgery for 
      synchronous colorectal primary and liver metastases between 2005 and 2014. There 
      was no difference in adjusted rates of major events or anastomotic leak. Patients 
      undergoing simultaneous resection were significantly less likely to experience 
      prolonged length of stay (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.21-0.37) or high hospital charges 
      (OR = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17-0.32) compared to staged resection even among patients 
      undergoing total hepatic lobectomy and complex colorectal resection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Simultaneous resection was found to be equally as safe as staged resection even 
      when evaluating patients undergoing more complex operations, and led to lower 
      health care utilization. Under appropriate clinical circumstances, simultaneous 
      resection offers benefits to patients and the health care system and should be 
      the recommended surgical approach.

TI  - Structural toggle in the RNaseH domain of Prp8 helps balance splicing fidelity 
      and catalytic efficiency.
PG  - 4739-4744
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1701462114 [doi]
AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression that 
      requires both high efficiency and high fidelity. Prp8 has long been considered 
      the "master regulator" of the spliceosome, the molecular machine that executes 
      pre-mRNA splicing. Cross-linking and structural studies place the RNaseH domain 
      (RH) of Prp8 near the spliceosome's catalytic core and demonstrate that prp8 
      alleles that map to a 17-aa extension in RH stabilize it in one of two mutually 
      exclusive structures, the biological relevance of which are unknown. We performed 
      an extensive characterization of prp8 alleles that map to this extension and, 
      using in vitro and in vivo reporter assays, show they fall into two functional 
      classes associated with the two structures: those that promote 
      error-prone/efficient splicing and those that promote hyperaccurate/inefficient 
      splicing. Identification of global locations of endogenous splice-site activation 
      by lariat sequencing confirms the fidelity effects seen in our reporter assays. 
      Furthermore, we show that error-prone/efficient RH alleles suppress a prp2 mutant 
      deficient at promoting the first catalytic step of splicing, whereas 
      hyperaccurate/inefficient RH alleles exhibit synthetic sickness. Together our 
      data indicate that prp8 RH alleles link splicing fidelity with catalytic 
      efficiency by biasing the relative stabilities of distinct spliceosome 
      conformations. We hypothesize that the spliceosome "toggles" between such 
      error-prone/efficient and hyperaccurate/inefficient conformations during the 
      splicing cycle to regulate splicing fidelity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences in surgical approach and postoperative 
      outcomes for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) before and after the 
      introduction of biologic therapy. BACKGROUND: Biologic use has dramatically 
      increased since Food and Drug Administration approval of infliximab. Studies 
      conflict as to the effect of these agents on surgical outcomes with some 
      demonstrating worse surgical outcomes whereas others have found no difference. 
      METHODS: We used an administrative, all-payer, all-age group database located in 
      New York State. Patients were included if they had a diagnosis of UC and 
      underwent surgery for their disease from 1995 to 2013. Outcomes were compared for 
      the index admission, at 90-day, and 1-year follow up. RESULTS: A total of 7070 
      patients were included for analysis; 54% patients underwent surgery between 1995 
      and 2005 and the remaining 46% patients underwent surgery between 2005 and 2013. 
      There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients who underwent at 
      least 3 procedures after 2005(14% vs 9%, P < 0.01). On adjusted analysis, 
      patients undergoing surgery after 2005 had higher likelihood of major events (odd 
      s ratio, OR = 1.42; 95% confidence interval, CI = 1.13-1.78), procedural 
      complications (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.20-1.68), and nonroutine discharge (OR = 
      3.17; 95% CI = 2.79-3.60) during the index admission. Similar trends for worse 
      adjusted outcomes in patients initially undergoing surgery after 2005 were seen 
      at 90-day and 1-year follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Since the introduction of biologic 
      agents in 2005, surgery for patients with UC is more likely to require multiple 
      procedures. Despite robust adjustments, patients having surgery recently have 
      worse postoperative morbidity during the index hospitalization, at 90-day and 
      1-year follow up. More work is necessary to improve outcomes in these higher risk 
      patients that undergo surgery.

TI  - Psychobiology of cumulative trauma: hair cortisol as a risk marker for stress 
      exposure in women.
PG  - 350-354
LID - 10.1080/10253890.2017.1340450 [doi]
AB  - Childhood trauma (CT) is associated with long-lasting alterations of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated risk for stress exposure 
      in adulthood. Although HPA alterations are present in the early aftermath of 
      trauma, it remains unclear how initial HPA activity is associated with subsequent 
      stress exposure and whether CT exposure influences the strength and direction of 
      this association. The present study examined prospective associations between 
      hair cortisol content (HCC) and stress exposure from baseline to 3-month 
      follow-up in young adult women with recent (i.e. past 3 months) exposure to 
      interpersonal violence (IPV; i.e. physical or sexual assault) and non-traumatized 
      controls. History of significant CT abuse or neglect was determined based on 
      clinical cutoffs for a self-report CT measure: 12 women had abuse or neglect and 
      recent IPV exposure (CT + IPV); 7 women had abuse or neglect but no IPV exposure 
      (CT); 15 women had no history of trauma (NTC). HCC was computed for 3 cm sections 
      reflecting cortisol secretion during the 3 months preceding the baseline 
      assessment. The interaction of cumulative trauma and HCC predicted stress 
      exposure over 3-month follow-up, controlling for baseline stress exposure and 
      depressive symptoms. Simple slopes analyses revealed that lower baseline HCC 
      predicted greater stress exposure in the CT + IPV group compared to the CT group; 
      HCC was not associated with stress exposure in the NTC group. The present 
      findings highlight the potential utility of HCC as a predictor of stress exposure 
      for women with a history of childhood abuse or neglect, particularly in the 
      context of recent IPV. Lay summary Adults with a history of CT show long-lasting 
      alterations in major stress response systems, including the HPA axis. They are 
      also more likely to experience stressful life events in adulthood. However, it is 
      not clear how altered HPA activity influences risk for stress exposure and 
      whether CT affects their relationship. The results from this study show that 
      lower HPA activity (measured with hair cortisol) predicted greater stress 
      exposure in women with CT - particularly for women who also experienced recent 
      incidents involving physical or sexual assault.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, mobile health technology has emerged as a promising avenue 
      for improving physician-patient communication and patient outcomes. The objective 
      of our study was to determine the public's perception of barriers and benefits to 
      using mobile health technology technologies to enhance recovery after operation. 
      METHODS: We used the Empire State Poll to ask 2 open-ended questions to 800 
      participants assessing their perceptions of benefits and barriers to use mobile 
      health technology after operation. All responses were coded independently, and 
      any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. We used grounded theory to allow 
      themes to arise from the codes. Interrater reliability was calculated using 
      Cohen's Kappa. RESULTS: Participants identified a range of possible barriers to 
      using mobile health technology apps after operation including: protecting 
      personal health information, technology effectiveness and failure, preference for 
      face-to-face interaction with their surgeon, level of effort required, and 
      ability of the older adults to navigate mobile health technology. Participants 
      identified multiple possible benefits including: better monitoring, improved 
      communication with their surgeon, minimizing follow-up visits, improved 
      convenience, and increased patient knowledge. In the study, 15% of all 
      respondents stated there were no barriers whereas 6% stated there were no 
      benefits. CONCLUSION: Participants were receptive to the many potential benefits 
      of this technology to enhance not only their relationships with providers and the 
      convenience of access, but also their health outcomes. We must address 
      participants concerns about data security and their fears of losing a personal 
      relationship with their doctor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health technologies (mHealth) may improve post-operative care 
      but it is unknown if patients are willing to use this technology. METHODS: We 
      surveyed 800 NY State residents to determine their willingness to engage in 
      mHealth after surgery and compared socioeconomic factors that may affect 
      willingness to engage. RESULTS: A majority of respondents reported willingness to 
      wear a tracker on their wrist (80.6%), fill out a survey (74.3%), send pictures 
      of their wound to their surgeon (66.3%), and share updates with friends/family 
      (59.1%). Older age was associated with lower likelihood of having a smartphone, 
      but not associated with willingness to engage with other features. Hispanic 
      ethnicity was associated with lower likelihood of wearing a tracker while Black 
      race was associated with lower willingness to send pictures. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Overall, potential users of mHealth are interested and willing to use mHealth. 
      Older respondents are as willing as younger respondents to engage with mHealth. 
      Individuals with Hispanic ethnicity and Black race may be less willing to engage 
      and therefore may require education regarding benefits of this technology.

TI  - Who Makes It to the End?: A Novel Predictive Model for Identifying Surgical 
      Residents at Risk for Attrition.
PG  - 499-507
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000002384 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We present 8-year follow-up data from the intern class of 2007 to 2008 
      using a novel, nonparametric predictive model to identify those residents who are 
      at greatest risk of not completing their training. BACKGROUND: Nearly 1 in every 
      4 categorical general surgery residents does not complete training. There has 
      been no study at a national level to identify individual resident and 
      programmatic factors that can be used to accurately anticipate which residents 
      are most at risk of attrition out. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 
      categorical general surgery interns was conducted between June and August 2007. 
      Intern data including demographics, attendance at US or Canadian medical school, 
      proximity of family members, and presence of family members in medicine were 
      de-identified and linked with American Board of Surgery data to determine 
      residency completion and program characteristics. A Classification and Regression 
      Tree analysis was performed to identify groups at greatest risk for 
      non-completion. RESULTS: Of 1048 interns, 870 completed the initial survey 
      (response rate 83%), 836 of which had linkage data (96%). Also, 672 residents had 
      evidence of completion of residency (noncompletion rate 20%). On Classification 
      and Regression Tree analysis, sex was the independent factor most strongly 
      associated with attrition. The lowest noncompletion rate for men was among 
      interns at small community programs who were White, non-Hispanic, and married 
      (6%). The lowest noncompletion rate for women was among interns training at 
      smaller academic programs (11%). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first longitudinal 
      cohort study to identify factors at the start of training that put residents at 
      risk for not completing training. Data from this study offer a method to identify 
      interns at higher risk for attrition at the start of training, and next steps 
      would be to create and test interventions in a directed fashion.

      Results from a Pilot Study.
PG  - 1500-1505
LID - 10.1007/s11605-017-3482-2 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many surgical readmissions are preventable. Mobile health 
      technology can identify nascent complications and potentially prevent 
      readmission. METHODS: We performed a pilot study of a new mobile health 
      application in adults undergoing major abdominal surgery. Patients reported their 
      pain, answered surveys, photographed their wound, were reminded to stay hydrated, 
      and used a Fitbit device. Abnormal responses triggered alerts for further 
      evaluation. Patients were followed postoperatively for 30 days and compliance 
      with app use was tracked. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients participated. Most were 
      female (58%) and white (61%). Six (19%) had an ostomy as part of their surgery. 
      83.9% of patients completed an app-related task at least 70% of the time and 89% 
      said using the app was easy to use. Patients generated an average of 1.1 alerts. 
      One patient was readmitted and generated seven alerts prior to readmission. 
      Patients participated most in collecting Fitbit data (84.8% of days) and 
      completing a single-item photoaffective meter, but had more difficulty uploading 
      photographs (51.4% completed). Eighty-nine percent of patients found the 
      application easy to use. CONCLUSIONS: A novel mobile health app can track patient 
      recovery from major abdominal surgery, is easy to use, and has potential to 
      improve outcomes. Further studies using the app are planned.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study provides an updated description of diversity along the 
      academic surgical pipeline to determine what progress has been made. METHODS: 
      Data was extracted from a variety of publically available data sources to 
      determine proportions of minorities in medical school, general surgery training, 
      and academic surgery leadership. RESULTS: In 2014-2015, Blacks represented 12.4% 
      of the U.S. population, but only 5.7% graduating medical students, 6.2% general 
      surgery trainees, 3.8% assistant professors, 2.5% associate professors and 2.0% 
      full professors. From 2005-2015, representation among Black associate professors 
      has gotten worse (-0.07%/year, p < 0.01). Similarly, in 2014-2015, Hispanics 
      represented 17.4% of the U.S. population but only 4.5% graduating medical 
      students, 8.5% general surgery trainees, 5.0% assistant professors, 5.0% 
      associate professors and 4.0% full professors. There has been modest improvement 
      in Hispanic representation among general surgery trainees (0.2%/year, p < 0.01), 
      associate (0.12%/year, p < 0.01) and full professors (0.13%/year, p < 0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Despite efforts to promote diversity in surgery, Blacks and Hispanics 
      remain underrepresented. A multi-level national focus is imperative to elucidate 
      effective mechanisms to make academic surgery more reflective of the US 
      population.

TI  - Using GoPro to Give Video-Assisted Operative Feedback for Surgery Residents: A 
      Feasibility and Utility Assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: As an adjunct to simulation-based teaching, laparoscopic video-based 
      surgical coaching has been an effective tool to augment surgical education. 
      However, the wide use of video review in open surgery has been limited primarily 
      due to technological and logistical challenges. The aims of our study were to (1) 
      evaluate perceptions of general surgery (GS) residents on video-assisted 
      operative instruction and (2) conduct a pilot study using a head-mounted GoPro in 
      conjunction with the operative performance rating system to assess feasibility of 
      providing video review to enhance operative feedback during open procedures. 
      DESIGN: GS residents were anonymously surveyed to evaluate their perceptions of 
      oral and written operative feedback and use of video-based operative resources. 
      We then conducted a pilot study of 10 GS residents to assess the utility and 
      feasibility of using a GoPro to record resident performance of an arteriovenous 
      fistula creation with an attending surgeon. Categorical variables were analyzed 
      using the chi-square test. SETTING: Academic, tertiary medical center. 
      PARTICIPANTS: GS residents and faculty. RESULTS: A total of 59 GS residents were 
      anonymously surveyed (response rate = 65.5%). A total of 40% (n = 24) of 
      residents reported that structured evaluations rarely or never provided 
      meaningful feedback. When feedback was received, 55% (n = 32) residents reported 
      that it was only rarely or sometimes in regard to their operative skills. There 
      was no significant difference in surveyed responses among junior postgraduate 
      year (PGY 1-2), senior (PGY 3-4), or chief residents (PGY-5). A total of 80% (n = 
      8) of residents found the use of GoPro video review very or extremely useful for 
      education; they also deemed video review more useful for operative feedback than 
      written or communicative feedback. An overwhelming majority (90%, n = 9) felt 
      that video review would lead to improved technical skills, wanted to review the 
      video with the attending surgeon for further feedback, and desired expansion of 
      this tool to include additional procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Although there has been 
      progress toward improving operative feedback, room for further improvement 
      remains. The use of a head-mounted GoPro is a dynamic tool that provides 
      high-quality video for operative review and has the potential to augment the 
      training experience of GS residents. Future studies exploring a wide array of 
      open procedures involving a greater number of trainees will be needed to further 
      define the use of this resource.

TI  - Mediators of compassionate goal intervention effects on human neuroendocrine 
      responses to the Trier Social Stress Test.
PG  - 533-540
LID - 10.1080/10253890.2017.1368489 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is thought to mediate 
      the effects of stress on illness. Research has identified a limited number of 
      psychological variables that modulate human HPA responses to stressors (e.g. 
      perceived control and social support). Prosocial goals can reduce subjective 
      stress, but have not been carefully examined in experimental settings where 
      pathways of impact on biological stress markers may be traced. Recent work 
      demonstrated that coaching individuals to strive to help others reduced HPA 
      responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) relative to other cognitive 
      interventions. However, identification of mediational pathways, which were not 
      examined in the original study, is necessary to determine whether the HPA 
      buffering effects were due to helping motivations (compassionate goals; CGs) 
      rather than via previously identified variables such as control or support. 
      METHODS: In this new analysis, we combined the original cortisol data with novel 
      observer ratings of interpersonal behavior and psychological variables during the 
      stress task, and conducted new, theory-driven analyses to determine psychological 
      mediators for the intervention's effect on cortisol responses (N = 54; 21 
      females, 33 males; 486 cortisol samples). RESULTS: Control, support, and task 
      ego-threat failed to account for the effects of the intervention. As 
      hypothesized, self and observer-rated CGs, as well as observer-rated perceptions 
      of participants' interpersonal behavior as morally desirable (but not as dominant 
      or affiliative) were significant mediators of neuroendocrine responses. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that stress-reduction interventions based on 
      prosocial behavior should target particular motivational and interpersonal 
      features.

TI  - Increased Metabolic Benefit for Obese, Elderly Patients Undergoing Roux-en-Y 
      Gastric Bypass vs Sleeve Gastrectomy.
PG  - 636-642
LID - 10.1007/s11695-017-2904-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We sought to assess outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) vs 
      laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) in a cohort of morbidly obese, 
      elderly patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review was conducted of 
      all patients age 60 years or greater undergoing LSG or LRYGB at our institution 
      between 2007 and 2014. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients who underwent LSG 
      (n = 65) or LRYGB (n = 69) were identified. Groups were similar with respect to 
      age (64 years, range 60-75 years), BMI (44.0 +/- 6.1), and ASA score (91% >/= ASA 3). 
      There were no differences in major post-operative complications (3, 4.7% LSG vs 
      4, 5.8% LRYGB, p = 0.75). Median follow-up was 39 months (IQR 14-64 months) with 
      no patients lost to follow-up. Patients undergoing LRYGB had improvement in each 
      of diabetes mellitus 2 (DM2), hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HL), and 
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) as well as a significant decrease in 
      insulin use (16/47, 34.0% pre-operatively vs 7/47, 15.2% post-operatively; 
      p = 0.03). Patients undergoing LSG had improvement in DM2 and HTN but not in HL 
      or GERD; there was no reduction in insulin dependence. Weight loss was not 
      significantly different between groups; mean percent total weight loss at 
      36 months was 26.9 +/- 9.0% in the LSG group and 23.9 +/- 9.3% in the LRYGB group, 
      p = 0.24. CONCLUSIONS: Both LSG and RYGB can be safely performed on morbidly 
      obese, elderly adults. At intermediate follow-up, there is an increased metabolic 
      benefit for elderly patients undergoing LRYGB over LSG.

      clinical depression and anxiety.
PG  - 608-625
LID - 10.1002/jclp.22524 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Interpersonal models of depression and anxiety have not examined the 
      role of interpersonal goals in shaping relationships and symptoms. Striving to 
      promote/protect desired self-images (self-image goals) may undermine 
      relationships and increase symptoms, whereas striving to support others 
      (compassionate goals) may be protective, but clinical relevance is unknown. 
      METHOD: We tested effects of compassionate versus self-image goals on 
      interpersonal functioning and symptoms in clinically depressed and/or anxious 
      participants (N = 47) during 10 days of experience sampling, over a 6-week 
      follow-up, and in a dyadic relationship. RESULTS: Participants reported higher 
      conflict and symptoms on days that they most pursued self-image goals, but noted 
      higher perceived support and lower symptoms when pursuing compassionate goals. 
      Goals prospectively predicted symptom changes 6 weeks later. Lastly, 
      informant-rated interpersonal goals predicted relationship satisfaction of both 
      patients and significant others. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the relevance of 
      self-image and compassionate goals for the interpersonal maintenance of 
      depression and anxiety.

TI  - Questioning patient engagement: research scientists' perceptions of the 
      challenges of patient engagement in a cardiovascular research network.
PG  - 1573-1583
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S135457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient engagement in research is a dominant discourse in clinical 
      research settings as it is seen as a move toward sustainable and equitable health 
      care systems. In Canada, a key driver is the Strategy for Patient-Oriented 
      Research of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, which asserts that 
      meaningful patient engagement can only be fostered when stakeholders understand 
      its value. This study assessed researchers' perceptions of the meaning and value 
      of patient engagement in research within a Canadian cardiovascular research 
      network. In doing so, the secondary aim was to inform the development of a 
      structured patient engagement initiative by identifying potential challenges and 
      related mitigation strategies. METHODS: We employed a multi-method strategy 
      involving electronic surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews with 
      network research scientists across Canada. Interview data were analyzed using 
      thematic and content analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-eight electronic surveys (response rate =33%) and 16 
      interviews were completed with network members. Some participants were uncertain 
      about the meaning and value of patient engagement. While voicing guarded support, 
      four challenges relating to patient engagement were identified from the 
      interviews: 1) identification of representative and appropriate patients, 2) 
      uncertainty about the scope of patients' roles given concerns about knowledge 
      discrepancies, 3) a perceived lack of evidence of the impact of patient 
      engagement, and 4) the need for education and culture change as a prerequisite 
      for patient engagement. Research scientists were largely concerned that patients 
      untrained in science and tasked with conveying an authentic patient experience 
      and being a conduit for the voices of others might unsettle a traditional model 
      of conducting research. CONCLUSION: Concerns about patient involvement in 
      research were related to a lack of clarity about the meaning, process, and impact 
      of involvement. This study highlights the need for education on the meaning of 
      patient engagement, evidence of its impact, and guidance on practical aspects of 
      implementation within this research community.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-onset colorectal cancer (E-CRC) is increasing in incidence, 
      unlike traditional CRC (T-CRC). We sought to characterize differences between 
      E-CRC and T-CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data sources included the Surveillance, 
      Epidemiology, and End Results database, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance 
      Survey, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We compared demographics, tumor 
      characteristics, and incidence of CRC in subjects aged 20 to 49 years (E-CRC) 
      with those aged >/= 50 years (T-CRC). We correlated the incidence of E-CRC and 
      T-CRC to CRC risk factors and age-dependent genomic characteristics of CRC using 
      TCGA. RESULTS: A total of 369,796 CRCs were identified (2000-2011). E-CRC 
      incidence has risen 1.4% per year, whereas T-CRC has declined 3.1% per year (P < 
      .05). The incidence of E-CRC increases in a step-wise fashion from the ascending 
      colon to rectum (P < 2.2e-16). E-CRC is more prevalent in male (53.7% vs. 46.4%; 
      P < .001), Black (14.6% vs. 11.0%; P < .001), and Hispanic (14.7% vs. 8.3%; P < 
      .001) patients. E-CRC presents with aggressive histology, including high-grade 
      (1.5% vs. 1.3%; P < .001), signet ring cell (1.9% vs. 0.9%; P < .001), and 
      mucinous carcinomas (8.9% vs. 8.1%; P < .001), and more often with distant 
      disease (24.4% vs. 18.8%; P < .001). The geographic distribution of E-CRC mirrors 
      United States counties with higher Black population densities. Unlike T-CRC, 
      E-CRC prevalence is not correlated with known CRC risk factors. E-CRC is 
      associated with a lower rate of mutations than traditional CRC. Limitations of 
      this study include E-CRC sample size for the TCGA analysis, as well as lack of 
      comorbidity information and family history. CONCLUSION: E-CRC tumors are 
      clinically, pathologically, and molecularly distinct from T-CRC. Further 
      evaluation of genetic and molecular differences is necessary to understand the 
      pathophysiology of E-CRC and to help target treatment/surveillance strategies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe public willingness to participate in regionalized surgical 
      care for cancer. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Improved outcomes at high-volume 
      centers following complex surgery have driven a push to regionalize surgical 
      care. Patient attitudes toward regionalization are not well described. METHODS: 
      As part of the Cornell National Social Survey, a cross-sectional telephone survey 
      was performed. Participants were asked about their willingness to seek 
      regionalized care in a hypothetical scenario requiring surgery. Their responses 
      were compared with demographic characteristics. A geospatial analysis of hospital 
      proximity was performed, as well as a qualitative analysis of barriers to 
      regionalization. RESULTS: Cooperation rate was 48.1% with 1000 total respondents. 
      They were an average of 50 years old (range 18 to 100 years) and 48.9% female. 
      About 49.6% were unwilling to travel 5 hours or more to seek regionalized care 
      for improved survival. Age >70 years [odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% confidence 
      interval (95% CI) 0.19-0.60] and perceived distance to a center >30 minutes (OR 
      0.60, 95% CI 0.41-0.86) were associated with decreased willingness to seek 
      regionalized care, while high income (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.39-3.16) was associated 
      with increased willingness. Proximity to a major center was not associated with 
      willingness to travel (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.67-1.22). Major perceived barriers to 
      regionalization were transportation, life disruption, social support, 
      socioeconomic resources, poor health, and remoteness. CONCLUSION: Americans are 
      divided on whether the potential for improved survival with regionalization is 
      worth the additional travel effort. Older age and lower income are associated 
      with reduced willingness to seek regionalized care. Multiple barriers to 
      regionalization exist, including a lack of knowledge of the location major 
      centers.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to reduce colorectal 
      cancer incidence, but its effect on colorectal cancer mortality is controversial. 
      The objective of this study was to determine the effect of hormone replacement 
      therapy on survival from colorectal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a 
      secondary analysis of data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian 
      Cancer Screening Trial, a large multicenter randomized trial run from 1993 to 
      2001, with follow-up data recently becoming mature. Participants were women aged 
      55 to 74 years, without recent colonoscopy. Data from the trial were analyzed to 
      evaluate colorectal cancer incidence, disease-specific mortality, and all-cause 
      mortality based on subjects' use of hormone replacement therapy at the time of 
      randomization: never, current, or former users. RESULTS: A total of 75,587 women 
      with 912 (1.21%) incident colorectal cancers and 239 associated deaths were 
      analyzed, with median follow-up of 11.9 years. Overall, 88.6% were non-Hispanic 
      white, and < 10% had not completed high school. The never-user group was slightly 
      older than the current or former user groups (average, 63.8 vs. 61.4 vs. 63.3 
      years; P < .001). Almost one-half (47.1%) of the current users had undergone 
      hysterectomy, compared with 21.6% of never-users and 34.0% of former users (P < 
      .001). Adjusted colorectal cancer incidence in current users compared to 
      never-users was lower (hazard ratio [HR], 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      0.69-0.94; P = .005), as was death from colorectal cancer (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 
      0.47-0.85; P = .002) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.72-0.80; P < 
      .001). CONCLUSIONS: Hormone replacement therapy is associated with a reduced risk 
      of colorectal cancer incidence and improved colorectal cancer-specific survival, 
      as well as all-cause mortality.

TI  - Association of Time to Attrition in Surgical Residency With Individual Resident 
      and Programmatic Factors.
PG  - 511-517
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2017.6202 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Attrition in general surgery residency remains high, and attrition 
      that occurs in the later years is the most worrisome. Although several studies 
      have retrospectively investigated the timing of attrition, no study to date has 
      prospectively evaluated a national cohort of residents to understand which 
      residents are at risk for attrition and at what point during residency. 
      OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate individual resident and programmatic factors 
      associated with the timing of attrition during general surgery residency. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This longitudinal, national cohort study administered 
      a survey to all categorical general surgery interns from the class of 2007-2008 
      during their first 30 days of residency and linked the data with 9-year follow-up 
      data assessing program completion. Data were collected from June 1, 2007, through 
      June 30, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Kaplan-Meier curves evaluating time to 
      attrition during the 9 years after the start of residency. RESULTS: Among our 
      sample of 836 residents (306 women [36.6%] and 528 men [63.2%]; gender unknown in 
      2), cumulative survival analysis demonstrated overall attrition for the cohort of 
      20.8% (n = 164). Attrition was highest in the first postgraduate year (67.6% 
      [n = 111]; absolute rate, 13.3%) but continued during the next 6 years, albeit at 
      a lower rate. Beginning in the first year, survival analysis demonstrated higher 
      attrition among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic residents (21.1% vs 12.4%; 
      P = .04) and at military programs compared with academic or community programs 
      after year 1 (32.3% vs 11.0% or 13.5%; P = .01). Beginning in year 4 of 
      residency, higher attrition was encountered among women compared with men (23.3% 
      vs 17.4%; P = .05); at year 5, at large compared with small programs (26.0% vs 
      18.4%; P = .04). Race and program location were not associated with attrition. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although attrition was highest during the internship 
      year, late attrition persists, particularly among women and among residents in 
      large programs. These results provide a framework for timing of interventions in 
      graduate surgical training that target residents most at risk for late attrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited understanding of the wide variation in attrition 
      rates among general surgery residencies. We used the validated Behavior 
      Inhibitory System/Behavior Approach System (BIS/BAS) instrument to compare 
      motivational traits among residents who did and not complete surgical training. 
      STUDY DESIGN: All US general surgery categorical interns in the class of 
      2007-2008 were surveyed with a validated motivational trait assessment tool. 
      American Board of Surgery records from 2008-2016 were used to determine who 
      completed training. Motivation, an aspect of personality, was assessed with the 
      BIS/BAS, which correlates with an individual's tendency to approach pleasant 
      stimuli (BAS) or avoid negative stimuli (BIS). Subscale mean scores were compared 
      with regard to the primary end point, attrition. RESULTS: Eight hundred and one 
      (76.5%) interns completed the survey and had matching records. Six hundred and 
      forty-five (80.5%) completed training. Men had lower scores than women in the BAS 
      Drive subscale (12.0 vs 12.5; p < 0.002), BAS Reward Response subscale (17.2 vs 
      17.7; p < 0.01), and BIS scale (19.3 vs 20.9; p < 0.01). The BAS Reward Response 
      scores differed based on program type (academic 17.3 vs community 17.6 vs 
      military 16.6; p < 0.0027). There were no differences based on program size (BIS 
      average, small program 19.9 vs large program 19.7; p = 0.43). There were also no 
      differences in BIS/BAS subscale scores based on residency completion status (BIS 
      mean: completed 19.9 vs dropped out 20.1; p = 0.51). CONCLUSIONS: Surgery 
      residents are characterized by a strong drive and persistence toward their goals. 
      However, residents who drop out do not differ from those who complete training in 
      their motivational personality traits.

AB  - Many psychiatric disorders are associated with cognitive dysfunction that is 
      ineffectively treated by existing pharmacotherapies and which may contribute to 
      poor real-world functioning. D-cycloserine (DCS) is a partial 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) agonist that has attracted attention because of its 
      cognitive enhancing properties, including in people with post-traumatic stress 
      disorder (PTSD). Here, we examined the effect of DCS on reversal learning - a 
      type of cognitive flexibility - following exposure to single prolonged stress 
      (SPS), a rodent model of PTSD. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 64) were trained to 
      press levers in an operant chamber, matched for performance and assigned to SPS 
      or control (unstressed) groups. Following SPS, rats received three additional 
      lever press sessions, followed by a side bias test on day three. One day later 
      they learned a response discrimination rule (press left or right lever, opposite 
      to side bias) and on a subsequent day were trained (and tested) for reversal to 
      the opposite lever. DCS (15 mg/kg) or vehicle was administered 30 minutes prior 
      to the reversal session. No between-group differences were found in acquisition 
      or retrieval of the initial rule, but a significant drug x stress interaction on 
      response discrimination reversal indicated that DCS had a greater beneficial 
      effect on SPS rats' cognitive flexibility than it did on performance in controls. 
      These findings add to a growing literature on the beneficial effects of DCS for 
      treating a wide variety of deficits that develop following exposure to extreme 
      stress and may have implications for the development of novel pharmacotherapies 
      for PTSD.

      study of medical internship.

LID - 10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.03.020 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress plays a causal role in depression onset, perhaps via 
      alteration of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning. HPA axis 
      hyperactivity has been reported in depression, though inconsistently, and the 
      nature of this relationship remains unclear, partly because cortisol measurement 
      over time has been challenging. Development of hair cortisol assessment, a method 
      that captures cortisol over prolonged periods of time, creates new possibilities. 
      In this study, hair cortisol was incorporated into a prospective and longitudinal 
      study of medical internship, stress and symptoms of depression. This provided a 
      rare opportunity to 1) prospectively assess hair cortisol responses to stress, 
      and 2) examine whether stress-induced changes in hair cortisol predict depressive 
      symptom development. METHODS: Hair cortisol, depressive symptoms, and 
      stress-relevant variables (work hours, sleep, perceived stress, mastery/control) 
      were assessed in interns (n = 74; age 25-33) before and repeatedly throughout 
      medical internship. RESULTS: Hair cortisol sharply increased with stressor onset, 
      decreased as internship continued, and rose again at year's end. Depressive 
      symptoms rose significantly during internship, but were not predicted by cortisol 
      levels. Hair cortisol also did not correlate with increased stressor demands 
      (work hours, sleep) or stress perceptions (perceived stress, mastery/control); 
      but these variables did predict depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION: Hair cortisol 
      and depressive responses increased with stress, but they were decoupled, 
      following distinct trajectories that likely reflected different aspects of stress 
      reactivity. While depressive symptoms correlated with stressor demands and stress 
      perceptions, the longitudinal pattern of hair cortisol suggested that it 
      responded to contextual features related to anticipation, novelty/familiarity, 
      and social evaluative threat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Distress is common among cancer and surgical patients and can lead to 
      worse outcomes if untreated. The objective of this study was to explore sources 
      of distress among colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This was a qualitative study using in-depth, semistructured, one-on-one 
      interviews in an academic setting. Patients were recruited if they had a 
      pathologically confirmed diagnosis of colon or rectal cancer. Purposive sampling 
      was used to recruit patients who were about to undergo (preoperative), or had 
      recently undergone (postoperative), curative resection for colorectal cancer. 
      RESULTS: All participants (n = 24) reported experiencing distress during 
      treatment. Participants identified sources of distress preoperatively (negative 
      emotional reaction to diagnosis, distress from preconception of cancer diagnosis, 
      and distress interacting with healthcare system). Sources of distress during 
      in-hospital recovery included negative emotional reaction to having a surgery and 
      negative emotions experienced in the hospital. Postoperative sources of distress 
      included mismatch of expectations and experience of recovery, dealing with 
      distressing physical symptoms and complications after surgery, and distress 
      worrying about recurrence. Participants identified other sources of distress that 
      were not time-specific (distress related to social support network, from 
      disruption of life, and worrying about death). CONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight 
      a potential role for a comprehensive screening program to identify which patients 
      require assistance with addressing sources of distress during the surgical 
      experience. Understanding how sources of distress may vary by time will help us 
      tailor interventions at different time points of the surgical experience.

TI  - Measuring Children's Mental Health in Ontario: Policy Issues and Prospects for 
      Change.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - Children's mental health in Canada is characterized by high needs coupled with 
      stark service shortfalls. In Ontario and in many provinces, addressing these 
      shortfalls is hampered by the absence of a measurement system, something that 
      researchers have long called for. This commentary aims to review the issues and 
      suggest prospects for improving the measurement of children's mental health in 
      Ontario and elsewhere. As background, we first describe the children's mental 
      health needs; outline the rationale for a measurement system; describe previous 
      attempts to introduce such systems, including in Ontario; and discuss the current 
      Ontario situation. We then explore some of the issues that constrain policy and 
      that need to be overcome, and suggest prospects for change - for advancing the 
      measurement of children's mental health in Ontario and Canada.

TI  - Altered ultradian cortisol rhythmicity as a potential neurobiologic substrate for 
      chronic insomnia.

AB  - Chronic insomnia is highly prevalent and associated with significant morbidity 
      (i.e., confers risk for multiple psychiatric and medical disorders, such as 
      depression and hypertension). Therefore, it is essential to identify factors that 
      perpetuate this disorder. One candidate factor in the neurobiology of chronic 
      insomnia is hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-axis dysregulation, and in particular, 
      alterations in circadian cortisol rhythmicity. Cortisol secretory patterns, 
      however, fluctuate with both a circadian and an ultradian rhythm (i.e., pulses 
      every 60-120 min). Ultradian cortisol pulses are thought to be involved in the 
      maintenance of wakefulness during the day and their relative absence at night may 
      allow for the consolidation of sleep and/or shorter nocturnal awakenings. It is 
      possible that the wakefulness that occurs in chronic insomnia may be associated 
      with the aberrant occurrence of cortisol pulses at night. While cortisol pulses 
      naturally occur with transient awakenings, it may also be the case that cortisol 
      pulsatility becomes a conditioned phenomenon that predisposes one to awaken 
      and/or experience prolonged nocturnal awakenings. The current review summarizes 
      the literature on cortisol rhythmicity in subjects with chronic insomnia, and 
      proffers the suggestion that it may be abnormalities in the ultradian rather than 
      circadian cortisol that is associated with the pathophysiology of insomnia.

AB  - Evolving scientific evidence about mammography has raised new questions about the 
      net benefits of organized screening, yet gaps remain about women's current 
      screening practices, knowledge, attitudes and values toward screening to support 
      informed decision making in this area. We addressed this gap through an online 
      survey of 2000 screen-eligible women from Ontario, Canada in January 2016. 
      Likert-scaled and categorical questions were used to collect information about 
      screening practices, knowledge of benefits and risks of screening and underlying 
      attitudes and values toward screening. Results for all responses were summarized 
      using descriptive statistics. Comparison of results between ever screened versus 
      never screened respondents was performed using chi-squared tests. Most women felt 
      informed about screening yet had doubts about how informed their decisions were. 
      They were more confident in their knowledge of the benefits than the risks which 
      aligned with the emphasis given to benefits in discussions with health care 
      providers. The benefits of screening were linked with lowered anxiety about 
      breast cancer. The never screened were less likely to overstate the benefits of 
      screening, more likely to give weight to the risks, and less likely to report 
      anxiety or worry about breast cancer. Findings highlight the need for improved 
      communication strategies and decision supports that emphasize the provision of 
      current, balanced information about the benefits and risks of screening, both at 
      the population-level (through mass media) and within patient-provider 
      interactions. Sensitivity to the psychosocial factors that shape women's 
      attitudes toward mammography screening should be central to any strategy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no consensus on the ideal management of complicated 
      appendicitis. METHODS: The New York State Planning and Research Cooperative 
      database was used to identify all patients admitted with complicated appendicitis 
      and undergoing appendectomy within 1-year. Primary outcome was any complication. 
      Secondary outcomes included length of stay (LOS), hospital charges, and 
      laparoscopy use. Outcomes were compared in appendectomy before or after 48h from 
      admission. RESULTS: 31,167 patients >/=18yo were identified for analysis, 
      28,015(89.9%) underwent early appendectomy. Early appendectomy patients were more 
      likely to be White (69.8% vs. 64.2% p < 0.01), and commercially insured (53.1% 
      vs. 45.4%, p < 0.01). Of the 3152 undergoing delayed surgery, 1610(51.1%) had 
      surgery later during the index admission, 715(22.7%) were readmitted urgently and 
      underwent appendectomy, and 827(26.2%) had elective appendectomy. Patients 
      undergoing delayed surgery had more complications (OR 1.34 95%CI 1.23-1.45), 
      readmissions (OR 1.55 95%CI 1.42-1.70), high hospital charges (OR 4.79 95%CI 
      4.35-5.27), and prolonged LOS (OR 6.12 95%CI 5.61-6.68). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      population-level study of complicated appendicitis we found more complications, 
      longer LOS, and higher charges in patients undergoing delayed surgery.

TI  - Association of Expectations of Training With Attrition in General Surgery 
      Residents.
PG  - 712-717
LID - 10.1001/jamasurg.2018.0611 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Attrition from general surgery training is highest during internship. 
      Whether the expectations and attitudes of new trainees affect their subsequent 
      risk of attrition is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To identify the expectations of general 
      surgery residency associated with attrition from training. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This prospective observational cohort study included categorical 
      general surgery interns entering training in the 2007-2008 academic year. 
      Residents were surveyed regarding their expectations of training and of life as 
      an attending at the start of their intern year (June 1 to August 31, 2007). 
      Expectations were grouped into factors by principal component analysis, and a 
      multivariable model was created using these factors in addition to known 
      demographic and program characteristics associated with attrition. Follow-up was 
      completed on December 31, 2016. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Attrition from 
      training was determined by linkage to American Board of Surgery resident files 
      through 2016, allowing 8 additional years of follow-up. RESULTS: Of 1048 
      categorical surgery interns in the study period, 870 took the survey (83.0% 
      response rate), and 828 had complete information available for analysis (524 men 
      [63.3%], 303 women [36.6%], and 1 missing information [0.1%]). Most were white 
      (569 [69.1%]) and at academic programs (500 [60.4%]). Six hundred sixty-six 
      residents (80.4%) completed training. Principal component analysis generated 6 
      factors. On adjusted analysis, 2 factors were associated with attrition. Interns 
      who choose their residency based on program reputation (factor 2) were more 
      likely to drop out (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.15). Interns who expected as 
      an attending to work more than 80 hours per week, to have a stressful life, and 
      to be the subject of malpractice litigation (career life expectation [factor 6]) 
      were less likely to drop out (odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82-0.98). CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Interns with realistic expectations of the demands of residency 
      and life as an attending may be more likely to complete training. Medical 
      students and residents entering training should be given clear guidance in what 
      to expect as a surgery resident.

AB  - Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by exaggerated reactivity to 
      social threat, often documented by biased attention to threatening information, 
      and increased activation in brain regions involved in salience/threat processing. 
      Attention training has been developed to ameliorate the attention bias documented 
      in individuals with SAD, with mixed results. We investigated patterns of brain 
      activation underlying acute attention modulation in 41 participants (29 with SAD 
      and 12 health controls). We then investigated how brain activation changed over 
      time in both groups in response to a 4-session attention training protocol 
      (toward threat, away from threat, no-training control). Results revealed 
      diminished pre-training deactivation in the insula in SAD participants during 
      attention modulation. SAD participants also demonstrated an increase in insula 
      deactivation over time, suggestive of an improvement in attention modulation of 
      emotion, and this was associated with a decrease in symptom severity. Attention 
      training did not, itself, lead to clinical improvement, though there was a trend 
      level effect of training toward threat on increased insula deactivation over 
      time. While deficits in attentional control and emotion modulation are documented 
      in individuals with SAD, current attention training protocols are not robustly 
      effective in ameliorating aberrant functioning. Pursuit of training protocols 
      that have more robust impacts on the relevant neural circuitry may have some 
      value.

AB  - While biomarkers have been used to define pathophysiological types and to 
      optimize treatment in many areas of medicine, in psychiatry such biomarkers 
      remain elusive. Based on previously described abnormalities of 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function in severe forms of depression, 
      we hypothesized that the temporal trajectory of basal cortisol levels would vary 
      among individuals with depression due to heterogeneity in pathophysiology, and 
      that cortisol trajectories that reflect elevated or increasing HPA activity would 
      predict better response to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). To test that 
      hypothesis, we sampled scalp hair from 39 subjects with treatment-resistant 
      depression just before ECT. Cortisol trajectory over the 12 weeks preceding ECT 
      was reconstructed from cortisol concentrations in sequential hair segments. 
      Cortisol trajectories varied widely between individuals, and exploratory analyses 
      of clinical features revealed associations with melancholia and global severity. 
      ECT non-responders showed a decreasing trajectory (mean change -25%, 
      95%-CI = [-1%,-43%]) during the 8 weeks preceding ECT (group-by-time interaction, 
      p = 0.004). The association between cortisol trajectory and subsequent ECT 
      response was independent of clinical features. A classification algorithm showed 
      that cortisol trajectory predicted ECT response with 80% accuracy, suggesting 
      that this biomarker might be developed into a clinically useful test for 
      ECT-responsive depression. In conclusion, cortisol trajectory mapped onto 
      symptoms of melancholia and independently predicted response to ECT in this 
      severely depressed sample. These findings deserve to be replicated in a larger 
      sample. Cortisol trajectory holds promise as a reliable, noninvasive, inexpensive 
      biomarker for psychiatric disorders.

TI  - Association between American Board of Surgery in-training examination score and 
      attrition from general surgery residency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam is administered 
      annually to general surgery residents and could provide a way to predict 
      attrition, potentially offering a point of intervention. METHODS: In 2007, a 
      national survey of categorical general surgery interns was performed. Resident 
      characteristics were linked to an American Board of Surgery database of American 
      Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores. Attrition was determined based on 
      completion of training during eight years of follow-up. To identify residents at 
      risk of attrition, American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores were 
      analyzed based on average rank and change in American Board of Surgery 
      In-Training Exam score. RESULTS: Of 1,048 residents, 739 (70.5%) participated and 
      108 (14.6%) did not complete training. Average American Board of Surgery 
      In-Training Exam rank was higher for participants who completed training than 
      those who did not (51.8 vs. 42.7 percentile respectively, P < .001). Ranking 
      below the 25th percentile was less common among those who dropped out (41.7% 
      ranked below 25th percentile and dropped out versus 51.5% ranked below 25th 
      percentile and completed, P = .06), but those whose rank dropped >16.5 percentile 
      points were more likely to leave training (attrition rate 13.0% with a drop 
      versus 6.0% without a drop, P = .003). In adjusted analysis, a one percentile 
      increase in American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam rank was associated with 
      decreased odds of attrition (OR 0.98, P < .01). CONCLUSION: Lower American Board 
      of Surgery In-Training Exam scores are associated with attrition, but this 
      difference is small, and some residents complete training with very low scores. A 
      large drop in American Board of Surgery In-Training Exam scores from one year to 
      the next appears to be associated with attrition. Program directors should focus 
      their efforts on these at-risk residents.

      systematic review of evaluation tools.
PG  - 1075-1084
LID - 10.1111/hex.12804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts 
      remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in 
      individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and 
      health systems have been published. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and appraise 
      evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system 
      decision making. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 1980 
      and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database 
      of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey 
      literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and 
      engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the 
      evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and 
      public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. RESULTS: In total, 10 663 
      unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were 
      developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of 
      engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature 
      review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the 
      public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, 
      and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the 
      public. CONCLUSION: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support 
      patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. 
      However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed 
      could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their 
      design and reporting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic diversity remains poor in academic surgery. However, no 
      study has quantified differences in the rates of retention and promotion of 
      underrepresented minority (URM) academic surgeons. METHODS: The American 
      Association of Medical Colleges Faculty Roster was used to track all first-time 
      assistant and associate professors appointed between 1/1/2003 and 12/31/2006. 
      Primary endpoints were percent promotion and retention at ten-year follow-up. 
      RESULTS: Initially, the majority of assistant and associate professors of surgery 
      were White (62%; 75%). Black assistant professors had lower 10-year promotion 
      rates across all specialties (p < 0.01). There were no race/ethnicity-based 
      differences in promotion for associate professors. Retention rates were higher 
      for White assistant professors than Asian or Black/Hispanic/Other minority 
      faculty (61.3% vs 52.8% vs. 50.8% respectively; p < 0.01). There was no 
      difference in 10-year retention rates among associate professors based on 
      race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS: Underrepresented minority surgeons are less likely 
      to remain in academia and Black assistant professors have the lowest rates of

      better support and develop minority faculty members in academic medicine.

TI  - Adaptive School-based Implementation of CBT (ASIC): clustered-SMART for building 
      an optimized adaptive implementation intervention to improve uptake of mental 
      health interventions in schools.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depressive and anxiety disorders affect 20-30% of school-age youth, 
      most of whom do not receive adequate services, contributing to poor developmental 
      and academic outcomes. Evidence-based practices (EBPs) such as cognitive 
      behavioral therapy (CBT) can improve outcomes, but numerous barriers limit access 
      among affected youth. Many youth try to access mental health services in schools, 
      but school professionals (SPs: counselors, psychologists, social workers) are 
      rarely trained adequately in CBT methods. Further, SPs face organizational 
      barriers to providing CBT, such as lack of administrative support. Three 
      promising implementation strategies to address barriers to school-based CBT 
      delivery include (1) Replicating Effective Programs (REP), which deploys 
      customized CBT packaging, didactic training in CBT, and technical assistance; (2) 
      coaching, which extends training via live supervision to improve SP competence in 
      CBT delivery; and (3) facilitation, which employs an organizational expert who 
      mentors SPs in strategic thinking to promote self-efficacy in garnering 
      administrative support. REP is a relatively low-intensity/low-cost strategy, 
      whereas coaching and facilitation require additional resources. However, not all 
      schools will require all three strategies. The primary aim of this study is to 
      compare the effectiveness of a school-level adaptive implementation intervention 
      involving REP, coaching, and facilitation versus REP alone on the frequency of 
      CBT delivered to students by SPs and student mental health outcomes. Secondary 
      and exploratory aims examine cost-effectiveness, moderators, and mechanisms of 
      implementation strategies. METHODS: Using a clustered, sequential 
      multiple-assignment, randomized trial (SMART) design, >/= 200 SPs from 100 schools 
      across Michigan will be randomized initially to receive REP vs. REP+coaching. 
      After 8 weeks, schools that do not meet a pre-specified implementation benchmark 
      are re-randomized to continue with the initial strategy or to augment with 
      facilitation. DISCUSSION: EBPs need to be implemented successfully and 
      efficiently in settings where individuals are most likely to seek care in order 
      to gain large-scale impact on public health. Adaptive implementation 
      interventions hold the promise of providing cost-effective implementation 
      support. This is the first study to test an adaptive implementation of CBT for 
      school-age youth, at a statewide level, delivered by school staff, taking an EBP 
      to large populations with limited mental health care access. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - 'I just want to be able to make a choice': Results from citizen deliberations

AB  - Despite Canada's long history with mammography screening, little is known about 
      citizens' perspectives about mammography and how best to support women to make 
      informed choices about screening. To address this gap, a series of four citizen 
      deliberation events were held in 2015-16 in Ontario, a Canadian province with an 
      organized population-based breast screening program in place since 1990. 
      Forty-nine individuals participated in four citizen panels, each comprising an 
      information session highlighting the evidence about mammography, and large- and 
      small-group deliberations about approaches to support informed decision making 
      for screening. Following their engagement with the research evidence about 
      mammography, participants expressed concern about their lack of full awareness of 
      the risks and benefits and a strong desire for choice when it comes to screening. 
      To support informed choice, mammography programs need to reflect the values of 
      information sharing, trust and transparency, financial accountability, and allow 
      for personal interactions and shared decision-making. Citizens are looking for 
      balanced information about the risks and benefits of screening presented in an 
      easy to understand, comprehensive, and transparent manner. Primary health care 
      providers and organized screening programs are important sources of information 
      about mammography and must be vigilant in their efforts to support informed 
      decision-making in this area by ensuring that the information materials they are 
      using are balanced and reflect current evidence.

TI  - Coping strategies among colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery and the 
      role of the surgeon in mitigating distress: A qualitative study.
PG  - 461-468
LID - S0039-6060(18)30315-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.surg.2018.06.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Distress is common among cancer patients and leads to worse 
      postoperative outcomes. Surgeons are often the first physicians to have in-depth 
      conversations with patients about a new colorectal cancer diagnosis; therefore, 
      it is important that these surgeons understand how patients cope with the 
      distress of a diagnosis and how they can help patients manage this distress. 
      METHODS: Patients with colorectal cancer were recruited from an outpatient 
      surgery clinic. Purposive sampling was used to recruit patients if they were 
      either planning to undergo surgery or had undergone surgery within six months. 
      In-depth, open-ended, individual qualitative interviews were performed. Grounded 
      theory was used to develop themes regarding patients' coping strategies and 
      beliefs regarding the role of the surgeon in helping them cope. RESULTS: Patients 
      described their own internal coping strategies using problem-focused, 
      emotion-focused, and meaning-focused techniques. Patients also reported the 
      importance of their social support network for coping. Patients believed surgeons 
      and their teams should help patients manage the emotional components of their 
      cancer diagnosis and surgical experience, especially if patients were 
      experiencing high levels of distress or had inadequate coping skills. They did 
      not believe surgeons themselves should be primarily responsible for helping them 
      cope. CONCLUSION: In order for surgeons to guide diagnosis and initial management 
      of distress in colorectal cancer patients undergoing surgery, they should screen 
      patients for distress, identify and strengthen patients' own coping strategies, 
      facilitate a strong social support network, and provide patients with the option 
      to obtain further support from the surgeon's office.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Medical school experience informs the decision to pursue graduate 
      surgical education. However, it is possible that inadequate preparation in 
      medical school is responsible for the high rate of attrition seen in general 
      surgery residency. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a national prospective 
      cohort study of all categorical general surgery interns who entered training in 
      the 2007-2008 academic year. Interns answered questions about their medical 
      school experience and reasons for pursuing general surgery residency. Responses 
      were linked with American Board of Surgery residency completion data. 
      Multivariable logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between 
      medical school experiences and residency attrition. RESULTS: Seven hundred and 
      ninety-two surgery interns participated, and the overall attrition rate was 
      19.3%. Most interns had performed </=8 wk of third year surgery clerkships (53.2% 
      of those who completed versus 49.7% of those who dropped out, P = 0.08). After 
      multivariable adjustment, shorter duration of third year rotations was protective 
      from attrition (OR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.29-0.99; P = 0.05). There was no difference 
      in attrition based on whether a surgical subinternship was performed (OR: 0.67, 
      95% CI: 0.38-1.19; P = 0.18). Residents who perceived that their medical school 
      surgical faculty were happy with their careers were less likely to experience 
      attrition (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.34-0.96; P = 0.03), but those who had gotten along 
      well with attending surgeons had higher odds of attrition (OR: 2.93, 95% CI: 
      1.34-6.39, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Increased quality, rather than quantity, of 
      clerkships is associated with improved rates of residency completion. Learner 
      relationships with positive yet demanding role models were associated with a 
      reduced risk of attrition.

      Research.
PG  - 675-705

AB  - Policy Points Engaging and involving underrepresented communities when setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. Groups and individuals 
      from minority and underserved communities strongly prioritized child health and 
      mental health research, often choosing to invest at the highest possible level. 
      Groups consisting of predominantly Native American or Arab American participants 
      invested in culture and beliefs research at the highest level, while many groups 
      did not select it at all. The priority given to culture and beliefs research by 
      these groups illustrates the importance of paying special attention to unique 
      preferences, and not just commonly held views, when getting public input on 
      spending priorities for research. CONTEXT: A major contributor to health 
      disparities is the relative lack of resources-including resources for 
      science-allocated to address the health problems of those with disproportionately 
      greater needs. Engaging and involving underrepresented communities in setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. We engaged minority and 
      underserved communities in informed deliberations and report here their 
      priorities for health research. METHODS: Academic-community partnerships adapted 
      the simulation exercise CHAT for setting health research priorities. We had 
      participants from minority and medically underserved communities (47 groups, n = 
      519) throughout Michigan deliberate about health research priorities, and we used 
      surveys and CHAT software to collect the demographic characteristics and 
      priorities selected by individuals and groups. FINDINGS: The participants ranged 
      in age (18 to 88), included more women than men, and were overrepresented by 
      minority groups. Nearly all the deliberating groups selected child health and 
      mental health research (93.6% and 95.7%), and most invested at the highest level. 
      Aging, access, promote health, healthy environment, and what causes disease were 
      also prioritized by groups. Research on mental health and child health were high 
      priorities for individuals both before and after group deliberations. Access was 
      the only category more likely to be selected by individuals after group 
      deliberation (77.0 vs 84.0%, OR = 1.63, p = .005), while improve research, health 
      policy, and culture and beliefs were less likely to be selected after group 
      deliberations (all, p < .001). However, the level of investment in many 
      categories changed after the group deliberations. Participants identifying as 
      Black/African American were less likely to prioritize mental health research, and 
      those of Other race were more likely to prioritize culture and beliefs research. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minority and medically underserved communities overwhelmingly 
      prioritized mental health and child health research in informed deliberations 
      about spending priorities.

TI  - Bottom-Up Synthesis and Mechanical Behavior of Refractory Coatings Made of Carbon 
      Nanotube-Hafnium Diboride Composites.
PG  - 1487-1495
LID - 10.1021/acsami.8b18840 [doi]
AB  - We use aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) forests as scaffolds to deposit hafnium 
      diboride (HfB(2)) and fabricate millimeter-thick ultrahigh-temperature composite 
      coating. HfB(2) has a melting temperature of 3250  degrees C, which makes it an 
      attractive candidate for applications requiring operation in extreme 
      environments. Compared to typical refractory HfB(2) processing, which requires 
      temperatures exceeding 1500  degrees C, we use conformal HfB(2) chemical vapor deposition 
      (CVD) to coat CNT forests at a low temperature of 200  degrees C. During this process, 
      nanometer-thin HfB(2) films grow on the CNT surface and uniformly fill tall CNT 
      forests, thus transforming nanometer film deposition to a scalable HfB(2) coating 
      technology. The conformal HfB(2) coating process uses static (S-) CVD, where the 
      precursor is fed into a closed system, enabling highly conformal coating and 
      economically efficient utilization of the HfB(2) precursor reaching 85%. The 
      modulus and compressive strength of the composites are measured using flat-punch 
      indentation of micropillars having various coating thickness. Filling the CNTs 
      with HfB(2) strengthens their node morphology and effectively enhances the 
      mechanical properties. We study the nonlinear behavior of the material to extract 
      a unique modulus value that describes the stress-strain response at any applied 
      compression. At the highest HfB(2) coating thickness of 45 nm, the solid fraction 
      is increased from 2% for the bare CNTs to 36% for the composite; the modulus and 
      strength reach 107 and 1.5 GPa, respectively. An analytical model is used to 
      explain the mechanism of the measured structure-mechanical property scaling. 
      Finally, the process is used to fabricate CNT-HfB(2) films having 1.7 mm height, 
      a centimeter square area, and only 5.8 x 10(-6) nm/nm thickness gradient to 
      demonstrate the potential for scalability.

AB  - As efforts to actively involve patients, family members and the broader public in 
      health service improvement and system redesign have grown, increasing attention 
      has also been paid to evaluation of their engagement in the health system. We 
      discuss key concepts and approaches related to evaluation, drawing particular 
      attention to different and potentially competing goals, stakeholders and 
      epistemological entry points. Evaluation itself can be supported by an increasing 
      number of frameworks and tools, matched to the relevant purpose and approach. The 
      patient engagement evaluation field faces several challenges, including the need 
      for greater specification of both the form and the context of engagement, the 
      need to balance the measurement imperative with the relational aspects of care 
      and the need for supportive organizations with the capacity and commitment to 
      undertake high-quality engagement and its evaluation.

TI  - Addressing the affordability of cancer drugs: using deliberative public 
      engagement to inform health policy.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s12961-019-0411-8 [doi]
LID - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health system expenditure on cancer drugs is rising rapidly in many 
      OECD countries given the costly new treatments and increased rates of use due to 
      a growing and ageing population. These factors put considerable strain on the 
      sustainability of health systems worldwide, sparking public debate among 
      clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, policy-makers and citizens on issues of 
      affordability and equity. We engaged Canadians through a series of deliberative 
      public engagement events to determine their priorities for making cancer drug 
      funding decisions fair and sustainable in Canada's publicly financed health 
      system. METHODS: An approach to deliberation was developed based on the McMaster 
      Health Forum's citizen panels and the established Burgess and O'Doherty model of 
      deliberative public engagement. Six deliberations were held across Canada in 
      2016. Transcripts were coded in NVivo and analysed to determine where 
      participants' views converged and diverged. Recommendations were grouped 
      thematically. RESULTS: A total of 115 Canadians participated in the deliberative 
      events and developed 86 recommendations. Recommendations included the review and 
      regular re-review of approved drugs using 'real-world' evidence on effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness; prioritisation of treatments that restore patients' 
      independence, mental health and general well-being; ensuring that decision 
      processes, results and their rationales are transparent; and commitment to people 
      with similar needs receiving the same care regardless of where in Canada they 
      live. CONCLUSIONS: The next steps for policy-makers should be to develop 
      mechanisms for (1) re-reviewing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data for all 
      cancer drugs; (2) making disinvestments in cancer drugs that satisfy requirements 
      relating to grandfathering and compassionate access; (3) ensuring fair and 
      equitable access to cancer drugs for all Canadians; and (4) fostering a 
      pan-Canadian approach to cancer drug funding decisions.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: While anxiety rates are alarmingly high in short sleeping 
      insomniacs, the relationship between insomnia and anxiety symptoms has not been 
      extensively studied, especially in comparison to the relationship between 
      insomnia and depressive symptoms. Using residency training as a naturalistic 
      stress exposure, we prospectively assessed the role of sleep disturbance and 
      duration on anxiety-risk in response to stress. METHODS: Web-based survey data 
      from 1336 first-year training physicians (interns) prior to and then quarterly 
      across medical internship. Using mixed effects modeling, we examined how 
      pre-internship sleep disturbance and internship sleep duration predicted symptoms 
      of anxiety, using an established tool for quantifying symptom severity in 
      generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). RESULTS: Pre-internship poor sleepers are at 
      more than twice the odds of having short sleep (</=6 h) during internship as good 
      sleepers (OR = 2.38, 95% CI = 1.61, 3.57). Poor sleepers were also at twice the 
      odds for screening positive for probable GAD diagnosis (OR = 2.08, 95% CI = 1.26, 
      3.45). Notably, sleep onset insomnia strongly predicted anxiety development under 
      stress (OR = 3.55, 95% CI = 1.49, 8.45). During internship, short sleep 
      associated with concurrent anxiety symptoms (b = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.38, -0.14) 
      and predicted future anxiety symptoms even more strongly (b = -0.39, 95% 
      CI = -0.76, -0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleepers, particularly those with sleep 
      onset insomnia symptoms, are vulnerable to short sleep and GAD anxiety and worry 
      during chronic stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Open Minds, Healthy Minds, Ontario's Comprehensive Mental Health and 
      Addictions Strategy commits to the transformation of mental health and addictions 
      services for all Ontarians. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the formulation and 
      implementation of this Strategy to address the question: What are the prospects 
      for transformative change in Ontario's current approach to mental health and 
      addictions? METHODS: Qualitative policy analysis using interpretive description 
      of key documents of the policy process, drawing on policy network and horizontal 
      governance theory. RESULTS: Three features set this policy process apart from 
      previous reform efforts: (1) expansion of the state pluralist network to those 
      outside of health, (2) extension of the policy network approach into the 
      Strategy's implementation stage and (3) the combined presence of political and 
      policy leadership. CONCLUSIONS: There is reason for optimism that the approach of 
      the Strategy has increased the prospects for the transformation of Ontario's 
      mental health and addictions system.

TI  - Citizen perspectives on the use of publicly reported primary care performance 
      information: Results from citizen-patient dialogues in three Canadian provinces.
PG  - 974-982
LID - 10.1111/hex.12902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Performance measurement and reporting is proliferating in all sectors 
      of the healthcare system, including primary care, despite a dearth of evidence on 
      how the public uses reports on primary care performance. We explored how the 
      public might use this information, to guide the development of effective 
      reporting systems for primary care. METHODS: We conducted six full-day 
      deliberative dialogue sessions with a purposive sample of 56 citizen-patients 
      across three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia). 
      Participants identified how they would use publicly reported performance data. We 
      conducted a thematic analysis of the data by region. RESULTS: Common uses for 
      primary care performance information emerged across all sessions. Participants 
      most often discussed the utility of this information for community advocacy and 
      participation in health system decision making. Similar barriers for using 
      performance information to choose a primary care provider were identified in each 
      region including the perceived lack of choice of providers and the high value 
      placed on relationships with current providers. Finally, the value of public 
      performance reporting in enhancing trust that people would receive good care was 
      also a common theme. CONCLUSIONS: Citizen-patient perspectives highlight that 
      public reporting on primary care performance could promote the health system's 
      responsiveness by enabling public engagement in decision making at the community 
      level. The role of public reporting in promoting trust rather than empowering 
      patient choice may reflect unique elements of the Canadian health system's 
      context.

TI  - Who is in and who is out? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder participation in 
      priority setting for health in three districts in Uganda.
PG  - 358-369
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czz049 [doi]
AB  - Stakeholder participation is relevant in strengthening priority setting processes 
      for health worldwide, since it allows for inclusion of alternative perspectives 
      and values that can enhance the fairness, legitimacy and acceptability of 
      decisions. Low-income countries operating within decentralized systems recognize 
      the role played by sub-national administrative levels (such as districts) in 
      healthcare priority setting. In Uganda, decentralization is a vehicle for 
      facilitating stakeholder participation. Our objective was to examine 
      district-level decision-makers' perspectives on the participation of different 
      stakeholders, including challenges related to their participation. We further 
      sought to understand the leverages that allow these stakeholders to influence 
      priority setting processes. We used an interpretive description methodology 
      involving qualitative interviews. A total of 27 district-level decision-makers 
      from three districts in Uganda were interviewed. Respondents identified the 
      following stakeholder groups: politicians, technical experts, donors, 
      non-governmental organizations (NGO)/civil society organizations (CSO), cultural 
      and traditional leaders, and the public. Politicians, technical experts and 
      donors are the principal contributors to district-level priority setting and the 
      public is largely excluded. The main leverages for politicians were control over 
      the district budget and support of their electorate. Expertise was a 
      cross-cutting leverage for technical experts, donors and NGO/CSOs, while 
      financial and technical resources were leverages for donors and NGO/CSOs. 
      Cultural and traditional leaders' leverages were cultural knowledge and influence 
      over their followers. The public's leverage was indirect and exerted through 
      electoral power. Respondents made no mention of participation for vulnerable 
      groups. The public, particularly vulnerable groups, are left out of the priority 
      setting process for health at the district. Conflicting priorities, interests and 
      values are the main challenges facing stakeholders engaged in district-level 
      priority setting. Our findings have important implications for understanding how 
      different stakeholder groups shape the prioritization process and whether 
      representation can be an effective mechanism for participation in health-system 
      priority setting.

TI  - Violence Victimization Predicts Body Mass Index One Decade Later among an Urban 
      Sample of African American Young Adults: Sex as a Moderator and 
      Dehydroepiandrosterone as a Mediator.
PG  - 632-643
LID - 10.1007/s11524-019-00360-6 [doi]
AB  - Psychological stressors such as violence victimization are known contributors to 
      obesity. However, moderators and mediators of this association have not been 
      studied, although they might offer pathways for intervention or prevention. Using 
      a sample of African American young adults, this study tested: (1) the moderating 
      effect of sex on the effect of violence victimization on trajectories of body 
      mass index (BMI), and (2) the mediating effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) 
      on this association. This 13-year longitudinal study followed 73 male and 80 
      female African American young adults who lived in an urban area from 1999 to 2012 
      when the youth were 20-32 years old. The independent variable was violence 
      victimization measured in 1999 and 2000. The dependent variable was BMI measured 
      in 2002 and 2012. The mediator was DHEA measured in 2001 and 2002. Multilevel 
      path analysis was used to test if males and females differed in violence 
      victimization predicting change in BMI (Model I) and the mediating effect of DHEA 
      change on the above association (Model II). The results of Model I suggested that 
      the change in violence victimization from 1999 to 2000 predicted change in BMI 
      from 2002 to 2012 for females, but not males. Based on Model II, the DHEA change 
      from 2000 to 2001 for females fully mediated the association between violence 
      victimization from 1999 to 2000 and increases in BMI from 2002 to 2012. Our 
      findings suggest that violence victimization in urban areas contributes to the 
      development of obesity among African American female young adults and change in 
      DHEA mediates this link. Violence prevention may have important implications for 
      obesity prevention of African American young women who live in unsafe urban 
      areas. This study also suggests that DHEA may be involved in the violence 
      victimization-obesity link for African American women.

AB  - Including information and values from patients in HTA has the potential to 
      improve both the process and outcomes of health technology policy decisions. 
      Accordingly, funding and structural incentives to include patients in HTA 
      activities have increased over the past several years. Unfortunately, these 
      incentives have not yet been accompanied by a corresponding increase in 
      resources, time, or commitment to responsiveness. In this Perspectives piece, we 
      reflect on our collective experiences participating in, conducting, and 
      overseeing patient engagement activities within HTA to highlight the ethical 
      challenges associated with this area of activity. While we remain committed to 
      the idea that patient engagement activities strengthen the findings, relevance, 
      and legitimacy of health technology policy, we are deeply concerned about the 
      potential for these activities to do ethical harm. We use this analysis to call 
      for action to introduce strong protections against ethical violations that may 
      harm patients participating in HTA engagement activities.

AB  - CONTEXT: Engaging underrepresented communities in health research priority 
      setting could make the scientific agenda more equitable and more responsive to 
      their needs. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate democratic deliberations engaging minority and 
      underserved communities in setting health research priorities. METHODS: 
      Participants from underrepresented communities throughout Michigan (47 groups, 
      n = 519) engaged in structured deliberations about health research priorities in 
      professionally facilitated groups. We evaluated some aspects of the structure, 
      process, and outcomes of deliberations, including representation, equality of 
      participation, participants' views of deliberations, and the impact of group 
      deliberations on individual participants' knowledge, attitudes, and points of 
      view. Follow-up interviews elicited richer descriptions of these and also 
      explored later effects on deliberators. RESULTS: Deliberators (age 18-88 years) 
      overrepresented minority groups. Participation in discussions was well 
      distributed. Deliberators improved their knowledge about disparities, but not 
      about health research. Participants, on average, supported using their group's 
      decision to inform decision makers and would trust a process like this to inform 
      funding decisions. Views of deliberations were the strongest predictor of these 
      outcomes. Follow-up interviews revealed deliberators were particularly struck by 
      their experience hearing and understanding other points of view, sometimes 
      surprised at the group's ability to reach agreement, and occasionally activated 
      to volunteer or advocate. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberations using a structured group 
      exercise to engage minority and underserved community members in setting health 
      research priorities met some important criteria for a fair, credible process that 
      could inform policy. Deliberations appeared to change some opinions, improved 
      some knowledge, and were judged by participants worth using to inform 
      policymakers.

AB  - Introduction: It has been hypothesized that people diagnosed with anxiety and 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) exhibit behavioral aberrations when faced 
      with the potential for negative outcomes, but the specific cognitive aspects of 
      decision-making that may be altered have not been systematically studied in 
      clinical populations. Here, we studied decision-making in a clinical cohort using 
      a task that allows for examination of the decision weights and values associated 
      with different choice outcomes. Methods: Patients diagnosed with OCD (n = 10), 
      generalized anxiety disorder (n = 15), social anxiety disorder (n = 14), and 
      healthy controls (n = 20) were given a decision-making task and choices were 
      modeled using a cumulative prospect theory framework. Results: We found OCD 
      patients to have lower value discrimination than controls, as well as less 
      optimal performance on the task, an effect that was mostly driven by trials with 
      only positive outcomes. Discussion: Our results shed light on the cognitive 
      processes that drive altered decision-making under risk in OCD. Specifically, 
      they demonstrate that OCD patients have diminished sensitivity to positive 
      outcomes, which might be associated with risk aversion and altered learning of 
      gain. These findings also extend prior reports, suggesting that altered cognitive 
      processing during decision-making is linked to altered perception of value, but 
      not probability, in these patients.

TI  - Supporting the evaluation of public and patient engagement in health system 
      organizations: Results from an implementation research study.
PG  - 1132-1143
LID - 10.1111/hex.12949 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As citizens, patients and family members are participating in 
      numerous and expanding roles in health system organizations, attention has turned 
      to evaluating these efforts. The context-specific nature of engagement requires 
      evaluation tools to be carefully designed for optimal use. We sought to address 
      this need by assessing the appropriateness and feasibility of a generic tool 
      across a range of health system organizations, engagement activities and patient 
      groups. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods implementation research design to study 
      the implementation of an engagement evaluation tool in seven health system 
      organizations in Ontario, Canada focusing on two key implementation outcome 
      variables: appropriateness and feasibility. Data were collected through 
      respondent feedback questions (binary and open-ended) at the end of the tool's 
      three questionnaires as well as interviews and debriefing discussions with 
      engagement professionals and patient partners from collaborating organizations. 
      RESULTS: The three questionnaires comprising the evaluation tool were 
      collectively administered 29 times to 405 respondents yielding a 52% response 
      rate (90% and 53% of respondents respectively assessed the survey's 
      appropriateness and feasibility [quantitatively or qualitatively]). The 
      questionnaires' basic properties were rated highly by all respondents. Concrete 
      suggestions were provided for improving the appropriateness and feasibility of 
      the questionnaires (or components within) for different engagement activity and 
      organization types, and for enhancing the timing of implementation. DISCUSSION 
      AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings offer guidance for health system 
      organizations and evaluators to support the optimal use of engagement evaluation 
      tools across a variety of health system settings, engagement activities and 
      respondent groups.

TI  - Supporting women at average risk to make informed decisions about mammography 
      when there is no "right" answer: a qualitative citizen deliberation study.
PG  - E730-E737
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20190102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women are encouraged to make informed choices about mammography 
      screening that align with their values and preferences, yet information materials 
      developed by screening programs rarely provide complete, balanced information 
      about screening. Through a series of deliberations with Ontario citizens, we 
      elicited perspectives on materials developed by screening programs to support 
      informed decision-making. METHODS: We held 4 deliberative engagement events with 
      citizens to discuss the current evidence about mammography and informed 
      decision-making for the general population (i.e., women not at high risk) in the 
      context of organized screening programs. Participants reviewed and provided 
      feedback on the educational materials currently produced by screening programs in 
      8 provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, 
      Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador) and 2 territories (Yukon Territory and 
      Northwest Territory) and identified the key features that should guide the design 
      of these materials to optimally support informed decision-making. RESULTS: In 
      general, participants viewed the educational materials as insufficient to support 
      informed decision-making. They identified the following key features of optimal 
      educational materials: they should be accessible, complete and accurate, and 
      provide information on both benefits and risks of screening in a comprehensive, 
      easy-to-understand manner. Information materials should evoke the trust of the 
      reader, and they should be consistent across Canada. INTERPRETATION: Canadian 
      women have insufficient access to reliable information sources and complete 
      evidence about mammography screening, and, without this information, they are 
      unable to make fully informed decisions. Canadian breast screening programs must 
      take steps to improve the information shared with women to support informed 
      decision-making that aligns with women's values and preferences.

TI  - Applying priority-setting frameworks: A review of public and vulnerable 
      populations' participation in health-system priority setting.

LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2019.12.005 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature that describes, applies, and 
      evaluates applications of health-system priority-setting frameworks in different 
      contexts. However, little explicit focus has been given to examining 
      operationalization of the stakeholder participation component of these 
      frameworks. The literature identifies the public as a stakeholder group and 
      recommends their participation when applying the frameworks. METHODS: We 
      conducted a scoping review to search the PubMed, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, Medline, and 
      PsycINFO databases for cases where priority-setting frameworks were applied 
      (2000-2017). We aimed to synthesize current literature to examine the degree to 
      which the public and vulnerable populations have been engaged through 
      applications of these frameworks FINDINGS: The following stakeholders commonly 
      participated: managers, administrators/coordinators, clinicians/physicians, 
      non-physician health care providers, health economists, academics/researchers, 
      experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers. Few papers reported on public 
      participation, and even fewer identified vulnerable groups that participate. 
      Stakeholders were most commonly reported to participate in identifying areas for 
      prioritization. CONCLUSIONS: While the frameworks were developed with stakeholder 
      participation in mind, in practice not all stakeholders are participating in 
      priority-setting processes as envisioned by the frameworks. The public and 
      vulnerable groups do not consistently participate, challenging the utility of the 
      participation component of frameworks in guiding stakeholder participation in 
      health-system priority setting. Frameworks can be more explicit about which 
      stakeholders should participate and detailing how their participation should be 
      operationalized.

TI  - Protocol for a randomized controlled trial examining multilevel prediction of 
      response to behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy for generalized 
      anxiety disorder.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s13063-019-3802-9 [doi]
LID - 17
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 40-60% of patients with generalized anxiety disorder experience 
      long-lasting improvement with gold standard psychosocial interventions. 
      Identifying neurobehavioral factors that predict treatment success might provide 
      specific targets for more individualized interventions, fostering more optimal 
      outcomes and bringing us closer to the goal of "personalized medicine." Research 
      suggests that reward and threat processing (approach/avoidance behavior) and 
      cognitive control may be important for understanding anxiety and comorbid 
      depressive disorders and may have relevance to treatment outcomes. This study was 
      designed to determine whether approach-avoidance behaviors and associated neural 
      responses moderate treatment response to exposure-based versus behavioral 
      activation therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS/DESIGN: We are 
      conducting a randomized controlled trial involving two 10-week group-based 
      interventions: exposure-based therapy or behavioral activation therapy. These 
      interventions focus on specific and unique aspects of threat and reward 
      processing, respectively. Prior to and after treatment, participants are 
      interviewed and undergo behavioral, biomarker, and neuroimaging assessments, with 
      a focus on approach and avoidance processing and decision-making. Primary 
      analyses will use mixed models to examine whether hypothesized approach, 
      avoidance, and conflict arbitration behaviors and associated neural responses at 
      baseline moderate symptom change with treatment, as assessed using the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale. Exploratory analyses will examine 
      additional potential treatment moderators and use data reduction and machine 
      learning methods. DISCUSSION: This protocol provides a framework for how studies 
      may be designed to move the field toward neuroscience-informed and personalized 
      psychosocial treatments. The results of this trial will have implications for 
      approach-avoidance processing in generalized anxiety disorder, relationships 
      between levels of analysis (i.e., behavioral, neural), and predictors of 
      behavioral therapy outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively 
      registered within 21 days of first participant enrollment in accordance with 
      FDAAA 801 with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02807480. Registered on June 21, 2016, 
      before results.

AB  - The development of refugee health policies is significant, given the increased 
      volume of displaced persons seeking refuge in Canada and around the world. 
      Changes to the Canadian refugee health policy, known as the Interim Federal 
      Health Program (IFHP), limited healthcare access for refugees and refugee 
      claimants from 2012 to 2016. In this article, we present a policy analysis using 
      the case of the IFHP retrenchments to examine how political actors on opposing 
      sides of the issue defined the problem using different causal story mechanisms. 
      This analysis reveals that organized interests dramatically changed the problem 
      definition of the IFHP reforms. Following their use of causal stories in 
      redefining the problem, the courts declared that the reforms to refugee 
      healthcare were a form of cruel and unusual treatment. Understanding policy 
      strategies used by proponents of refugee healthcare coverage expansion is 
      important for countries responding to the current, enduring refugee crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in developed 
      public health systems remain understudied. Current approaches to HTA present a 
      variety of conceptual, methodological and practical problems in the context of 
      child health. This study explores the technical and sociopolitical determinants 
      of public funding decisions on paediatric drugs, through the analysis of 
      interviews with stakeholders involved in or impacted by HTA for child health 
      technologies at the provincial and national levels in Canada. METHODS: We 
      undertook in-depth interviews with a purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders 
      involved with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the 
      provincial (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Grounded theory methods were 
      employed to guide data collection and analysis. Theory on 'technology-as-policy' 
      and the sociopolitics of health technologies served as sensitizing concepts for 
      inductive data coding and analysis. Emergent themes informed the development of 
      conceptual and practical insights on social values and system dynamics related to 
      child HTA, of relevance to public policymaking on the coverage of health 
      technologies for children in Canada. RESULTS: Participant reflection on the 
      normative and systems dimensions of drug funding for children formed two broad 
      categories: HTA paradigms and sociopolitical context. Our analysis revealed 
      notable differences of context and substance related to child health technology 
      production, evaluation and use. These differences spanned the major phases of HTA 
      (from assembly to assessment to integration) and the surrounding sociopolitical 
      milieu (from markets to governance to politics). Careful analysis of these 
      differences sets in relief a number of substantive and procedural shortcomings of 
      current HTA paradigms in respect of child health. Our findings suggest a need to 
      rethink how HTA is structured and operationalized for child health technologies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Current approaches to health technology assessment are not well 
      calibrated to the realities of child health and illness. Our study presents a 
      nuanced and contextually grounded analysis of concepts instrumental to drug 
      funding decisions for children. The insights generated are directly applicable to 
      the Canadian and Ontario contexts, but also yield fundamental knowledge about HTA

TI  - Understanding health professional role integration in complex adaptive systems: a 
      multiple-case study of physician assistants in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 365

LID - 365
AB  - BACKGROUND: To meet the complex needs of healthcare delivery, the Ministry of 
      Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) introduced Physician Assistants (PAs) into the 
      Ontario health care system in 2006 with the goal of helping to increase access to 
      care, decrease wait times, improve continuity of care and provide a flexible 
      addition to the healthcare workforce. The characterization of healthcare 
      organizations as complex adaptive systems (CAS) may offer insight into the 
      relationships and interactions that optimize and restrict successful PA 
      integration. The aim of this study is to explore the integration of PAs across 
      multiple case settings and to understand the role of PAs within complex adaptive 
      systems. METHODS: An exploratory, multiple-case study was used to examine PA role 
      integration in four settings: family medicine, emergency medicine, general 
      surgery, and inpatient medicine. Interviews were conducted with 46 healthcare 
      providers and administrators across 13 hospitals and 6 family medicine clinics in 
      Ontario, Canada. Analysis was conducted in three phases including an inductive 
      thematic analysis within each of the four cases, a cross-case thematic analysis, 
      and a broader, deductive exploration of cross-case patterns pertaining to 
      specific complexity theory principles of interest. RESULTS: Forty-six health care 
      providers were interviewed across 19 different healthcare sites. Support for PA 
      contributions across various health care settings, the importance of role 
      awareness, supervisory relationship attributes, and role vulnerability are 
      interconnected and dynamic. Findings represent the experiences of PAs and other 
      healthcare providers, and demonstrate how the PAs willingness to work and ability 
      to build relationships allows for the establishment of interprofessional, 
      collaborative, and person-centered care. As a self-organizing agent in complex 
      adaptive systems (i.e., health organizations), PA role exploration revealed 
      patterns of team behavior, non-linear interconnections, open relationships, 
      dynamic systems, and the legacy of role implementation as defined by complexity 
      theory. CONCLUSIONS: By exploring the role of PAs across multiple sites, the 
      complexity theory lens concurrently fosters an awareness of emerging patterns, 
      relationships and non-linear interactions within the defined context of the 
      Ontario healthcare system. By establishing collaborative, interprofessional care 
      models in hospital and community settings, PAs are making a significant 
      contribution to Ontario healthcare settings.

TI  - Does moral reasoning influence public values for health care priority setting?: A 
      population-based randomized stated preference survey.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preferences of members of the public are recognized as important 
      inputs into health care priority-setting, though knowledge of such preferences is 
      scant. We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare 
      resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an 
      experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. 
      Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual 
      analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral 
      reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the 
      differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. 
      RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to 
      allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral 
      reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger 
      respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for 
      children. The top principles guiding participants' allocative decisions were 
      treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation 
      of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by 
      participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this 
      preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, 
      revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access. Definitions of value 
      in healthcare based on clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness may exclude moral 
      considerations that the public values, such as equality and humanitarianism, 
      highlighting opportunities to enrich healthcare priority-setting through public 
      engagement.

TI  - Understanding the Role of Values in Health Policy Decision-Making From the 
      Perspective of Policy-Makers and Stakeholders: A Multiple-Case Embedded Study in 
      Chile and Colombia.
PG  - 185-197
LID - 10.15171/ijhpm.2019.94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chile and Colombia are examples of Latin American countries with 
      health systems shaped by similar values. Recently, both countries have crafted 
      policies to regulate the participation of private for-profit insurance companies 
      in their health systems, but through very different mechanisms. This study asks: 
      what values are important in the decision-making processes that crafted these 
      policies? And how and why are they used? METHODS: An embedded multiple-case study 
      design was carried out for 2 specific decisions in each country: (1) in Chile, 
      the development of the Universal Plan of Explicit Entitlements -AUGE/GES - and 
      mandating universal coverage of treatments for high-cost diseases; and (2) in 
      Colombia, the declaration of health as a fundamental right and a mechanism to 
      explicitly exclude technologies that cannot be publicly funded. We interviewed 
      key informants involved in one or more of the decisions and/or in the policy 
      analysis and development process that contributed to the eventual decision. The 
      data analysis involved a constant comparative approach and thematic analysis for 
      each case study. RESULTS: From the 40 individuals who were invited, 28 key 
      informants participated. A tension between 2 important values was identified for 
      each decision (eg, solidarity vs. individualism for the AUGE/GES plan in Chile; 
      human dignity vs. sustainability for the declaration of the right to health in 
      Colombia). Policy-makers used values in the decisionmaking process to frame 
      problems in meaningful ways, to guide policy development, as a pragmatic 
      instrument to make decisions, and as a way to legitimize decisions. In Chile, 
      values such as individualism and free choice were incorporated in decision-making 
      because attaining private health insurance was seen as an indicator of improved 
      personal economic status. In Colombia, human dignity was incorporated as the core 
      value because the Constitutional Court asserted its importance in its use of 
      judicial activism as a check on the power of the executive and legislative 
      branches. CONCLUSION: There is an opportunity to open further exploration of the 
      role of values in different health decisions, political sectors besides health, 
      and even other jurisdictions.

      system's role in the illness unclear. Comparisons across studies are complicated 
      by variation in co-morbidity (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder-PTSD, anxiety 
      disorders), exposure to trauma, and timing of trauma (child vs. adult). Here, we 
      examined the impact of these factors on HPA axis profiles in depression. METHODS: 
      We recruited 5 groups of participants: MDD (n = 14), comorbid MDD + PTSD 
      following adulthood trauma (MDD + PTSD-Adult; n = 12), comorbid MDD + PTSD 
      following childhood trauma (MDD + PTSD-Child; n = 18), comorbid MDD + social 
      anxiety disorder (MDD + SAD; n = 12), and non-depressed control participants who 
      were sex and age matched to patients (combined total n = 36). HPA axis function 
      was assessed using three challenges: stress reactivity via the Trier Social 
      Stress Test (TSST), feedback sensitivity via a dexamethasone suppression test 
      (DST), and central drive via a metyrapone challenge (MET). We compared hormonal 
      responses between patient groups and their respective non-depressed controls. 
      RESULTS: MDD + PTSD-Child showed low cortisol levels at baseline, and reduced 
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels at baseline and throughout the TSST. 
      MDD-only, MDD + PTSD-Adult, and MDD + SAD did not differ from non-depressed 
      controls in HPA axis responses to the TSST. Controlling for childhood trauma 
      severity, the reduced baseline levels in MDD + PTSD-Child were no longer 
      significant and significantly reduced baseline cortisol levels emerged for MDD + 
      PTSD-Adult. No diagnostic group effects were detected with DST and MET. Childhood 
      maltreatment subtypes were associated with unique HPA axis responses to TSST and 
      MET. CONCLUSION: Comorbidity and trauma exposure, as well as their timing and 
      type, contribute to inconsistencies in the depression literature and must be 
      included in efforts to clarify the role of the HPA axis in MDD.

AB  - Conventional definitions of mental health, manhood, and social support create 
      barriers to accessing behavioral health care for Black men ages 18 to 30. 
      Targeted behavioral health interventions sensitive to culture, social norms, and 
      gender that circumvent these barriers are desperately needed to improve access 
      and integrated care for this group. This article reports mixed methods findings 
      from the 2017 iteration of the Young Black Men, Masculinities, and Mental Health 
      (YBMen) project, a social media-based, psychoeducational program that promotes 
      mental health, progressive definitions of manhood, and sustainable social support 
      for Black men. Young Black men (n = 350) across two universities in the Midwest 
      completed baseline surveys on their mental health, definitions of manhood, and 
      social support. Forty of the men participated in the YBMen intervention and at 
      postintervention reported experiencing fewer depressive symptoms on the Patient 
      Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9, Z = -2.05, p < .01) and the Gotland Male Depression 
      Scale (GMDS; Z = -1.76, p < .05). There were also changes on the Conformity to 
      Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI) for Self-Reliance (Z = -0.34, p = .26) and 
      Heterosexual Self-Presentation (Z = -0.18, p = .59), though these changes were 
      not statistically significant. A qualitative review of postintervention 
      interviews revealed participants' appreciation of the YBMen project and its 
      influence on their mental health, manhood, and social support. Programmatic 
      efforts that support the behavioral health, positive development, and social 
      relationships of Black men translate into positive families, communities, and 
      experiences as they live, learn, love, and work over the life course.

TI  - Priority measures for publicly reporting primary care performance: Results of 
      public engagement through deliberative dialogues in 3 Canadian provinces.
PG  - 1213-1223
LID - 10.1111/hex.13100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While public reporting of hospital-based performance measurement is 
      commonplace, it has lagged in the primary care sector, especially in Canada. 
      Despite the increasing recognition of patients as active partners in the 
      health-care system, little is known about what information about primary care 
      performance is relevant to the Canadian public. We explored patient perspectives 
      and priorities for the public reporting of primary care performance measures. 
      METHODS: We conducted six deliberative dialogue sessions across three Canadian 
      provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia). Participants were asked to 
      rank and discuss the importance of collecting and reporting on specific 
      dimensions and indicators of primary care performance. We conducted a thematic 
      analysis of the data. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients participated in the dialogue 
      sessions. Measures of access to primary care providers, communication with 
      providers and continuity of information across all providers involved in a 
      patient's care were identified as the highest priority indicators of primary care 
      performance from a patient perspective. Several common measures of quality of 
      care, such as rates of cancer screening, were viewed as too patient dependent to 
      be used to evaluate the health system or primary care provider's performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that public reporting aimed at patient 
      audiences should focus on a nuanced measure of access, incorporation of context 
      reported alongside measurement that is for public audiences, clear reporting on 
      provider communication and a measure of information continuity. Participants 
      highlighted the importance the public places on their providers staying up to 
      date with advances in care.

TI  - Ethical and Social Values for Paediatric Health Technology Assessment and Drug 
      Policy.
PG  - 374-382
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in advanced 
      health systems remain understudied. In particular, the ethical and social values 
      dimensions of health technology assessment (HTA) and drug coverage decisions for 
      children have received almost no attention in research or policy. METHODS: To 
      elicit and understand the social values that influence decision-making for public 
      funding of paediatric drugs, we undertook a series of in-depth, semi-structured 
      interviews with a stratified purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders involved 
      with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the provincial 
      (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Constructivist grounded theory 
      methodology guided data collection and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our study 
      provides empirical evidence about the unique ethical and social values dimensions 
      of HTA for children, and describes a novel social values typology for paediatric 
      drug policy decision-making. Three principal categories of values emerged from 
      stakeholder reflections on HTA and drug policy-making for children: procedural 
      values, structural values, and sociocultural values. Key findings include the 
      importance of attention to the procedural legitimacy of HTA for children, with 
      emphasis on the inclusion of child health voices in processes of technology 
      appraisal and policy uptake; a role for HTA institutions to consider the equity 
      impacts of technologies, both in setting review priorities and in assessing the 
      value of technologies for public coverage; and the potential benefits of a 
      distinct national framework to guide drug policy for children. CONCLUSION: 
      Current approaches to HTA are not well designed for the realities of child health 
      and illness, nor the societal priorities regarding children that our study 
      identified. This research generates new knowledge to inform decision-making on 
      paediatric drugs by HTA institutions and government payers in Canada and other 
      publicly-funded health systems, through insights into the relevant social values 
      for child drug funding decisions from varied stakeholder groups.

TI  - Treatment-Specific Associations Between Brain Activation and Symptom Reduction in 
      OCD Following CBT: A Randomized fMRI Trial.
PG  - 39-47
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.2020.19080886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to examine whether brain activity is associated 
      with treatment response to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in adolescents and 
      adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and whether any associations are 
      treatment specific relative to an active control psychotherapy (stress management 
      therapy; SMT). METHODS: Eighty-seven patients with OCD (age range 12-45 years; 57 
      female, 39 medicated) were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of CBT or SMT. 
      Prior to treatment, functional MRI scans were conducted in patients performing an 
      incentive flanker task, which probes brain activation to both cognitive control 
      and reward processing. Voxelwise linear mixed-effects models examined whether 
      baseline brain activation was differentially associated with change in scores on 
      the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (standard or Children's version) over 
      the course of CBT or SMT treatment. RESULTS: Within the CBT group, a better 
      treatment response was significantly associated with greater pretreatment 
      activation within the right temporal lobe and rostral anterior cingulate cortex 
      during cognitive control and within the ventromedial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, 
      lateral prefrontal, and amygdala regions during reward processing. In contrast, 
      reduced pretreatment activation within a largely overlapping set of regions was 
      significantly associated with a better treatment response to SMT. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study findings demonstrate that associations between brain activation and 
      treatment response were treatment specific to CBT relative to a control 
      psychotherapy and that these associations were stable from adolescence to mature 
      adulthood. Such treatment-specific associations are important for the development 
      of biomarkers to personalize treatment in OCD.

TI  - A framework for explaining the role of values in health policy decision-making in 
      Latin America: a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/s12961-020-00584-y [doi]
LID - 100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although values underpin the goals pursued in health systems, 
      including how health systems benefit the population, it is often not clear how 
      values are incorporated into policy decision-making about health systems. The 
      challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and 
      financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This 
      is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin 
      American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what 
      conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA 
      countries. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for 
      this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written 
      in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy 
      process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. 
      Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One 
      researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured 
      summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles 
      to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of 
      agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS: We 
      identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We 
      identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been 
      used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework 
      has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the 
      health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments 
      adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); 
      (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a 
      transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational 
      values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make 
      decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four 
      factors). CONCLUSIONS: It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different 
      social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about 
      health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate 
      values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the 
      achievement of policy goals in health system financing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      protocol was registered with PROSPERO, ID=CRD42017057049 .

TI  - Colonic Stents as a Bridge to Surgery Compared with Immediate Resection in 
      Patients with Malignant Large Bowel Obstruction in a NY State Database.
PG  - 809-817
LID - 10.1007/s11605-020-04790-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is controversy surrounding the efficacy and safety of colonic 
      stents as a bridge to surgery compared with immediate resection in patients 
      presenting with an acute malignant large bowel obstruction. METHODS: 
      Retrospective longitudinal cohort study using the NYS SPARCS Database. Patients 
      with acute malignant large bowel obstruction who either had stent followed by 
      elective surgery within 3 weeks (bridge to surgery) or underwent immediate 
      resection between October 2009 and June 2016 in the state of New York were 
      included. The primary outcome was rate of stoma creation at index resection. 
      Secondary outcomes were 90-day readmission, reoperation, procedural 
      complications, and discharge disposition. RESULTS: A total of 3059 patients were 
      included, n = 2917 (95.4%) underwent an immediate resection and n = 142 (4.6%) 
      underwent bridge to surgery. We analyzed 139 patients in propensity score-matched 
      groups. Patients in the bridge to surgery group were less likely than those in 
      the immediate resection group to get a stoma at the time of surgery (OR 0.33, 95% 
      CI 0.18-0.60). They were also less likely to be discharged to a rehabilitation 
      facility or require a home health aide upon discharge (OR 0.36, 95% CI 
      0.22-0.61). There were no differences in rates of 90-day readmission, 
      reoperation, or procedural complications between groups. DISCUSSION: Colonic 
      stenting as a bridge to surgery leads to less stoma creation, a significant 
      quality of life advantage, compared with immediate resection. Patients should be 
      counseled regarding these potential benefits when the technology is available.

TI  - Differential associations of parental harshness and parental disengagement with 
      overall cortisol output at 15 years: Implications for adolescent mental health.
PG  - 129-146
LID - 10.1017/S0954579420000954 [doi]
AB  - Psychosocial stress in childhood and adolescence is linked to stress system 
      dysregulation, although few studies have examined the relative impacts of 
      parental harshness and parental disengagement. This study prospectively tested 
      whether parental harshness and disengagement show differential associations with 
      overall cortisol output in adolescence. Associations between overall cortisol 
      output and adolescent mental health problems were tested concurrently. 
      Adolescents from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) provided 
      hair samples for cortisol assay at 15 years (N = 171). Caregivers reported on 
      parental harshness and disengagement experiences at 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15 years, and 
      adolescents reported at 15 years. Both parent and adolescent reported depressive 
      and anxiety symptoms and antisocial behaviors at 15. Greater parental harshness 
      from 1-15 years, and harshness reported at 15 years in particular, was associated 
      with higher overall cortisol output at 15. Greater parental disengagement from 
      1-15 years, and disengagement at 1 year specifically, was associated with lower 
      cortisol output. There were no significant associations between cortisol output 
      and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or antisocial behaviors. These results 
      suggest that the unique variances of parental harshness and disengagement may 
      have opposing associations with cortisol output at 15 years, with unclear 
      implications for adolescent mental health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The National Accreditation Program for Rectal Cancer (NAPRC) 
      emphasizes a multidisciplinary approach for treating rectal cancer and has 
      developed performance measures to ensure that patients receive standardized care. 
      We hypothesized that rectal cancer patients receiving care at multiple centers 
      would be less likely to receive timely and appropriate care. STUDY DESIGN: A 
      single institution retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database 
      was performed. All patients undergoing proctectomy and </=1 other treatment 
      modality (eg radiation and/or chemotherapy) for Stage II/III rectal 
      adenocarcinoma were included. Unified care was defined as receiving all 
      modalities of care at our institution, and fragmented care was defined as having 
      at least 1 treatment modality at another institution. RESULTS: From 2009 to 2019, 
      415 patients met inclusion criteria, with 197 (47.5%) receiving fragmented care 
      and 218 (52.5%) receiving unified care. The unified cohort patients were more 
      likely to see a colorectal surgeon before starting treatment (89.0% vs 78.7%, 
      p < 0.01) and start definitive treatment within 60 days of diagnosis (89.0% vs 
      79.7%, p = 0.01). On adjusted analysis, unified care patients were 2.78 times 
      more likely to see a surgeon before starting treatment (95% CI 1.47-5.24) and 
      2.63 times more likely to start treatment within 60 days (95% CI 1.35-5.13). 
      There was no difference in 90-day mortality or 5-year disease-free survival. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective cohort study suggests patients with rectal cancer 
      receiving fragmented care are at an increased risk of delays in care without any 
      impact on disease-free survival. These findings need to be considered within the 
      context of ongoing regionalization of rectal cancer care to ensure all patients 
      receive optimal care, irrespective of whether care is delivered across multiple 
      institutions.

TI  - The Moral Foundations of Child Health and Social Policies: A Critical 
      Interpretive Synthesis.
LID - 10.3390/children8010043 [doi]
LID - 43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allusions to the uniqueness and value of childhood abound in 
      academic, lay, and policy discourse. However, little clarity exists on the values 
      that guide child health and social policy-making. We review extant academic 
      literature on the normative dimensions of child health and social policy to 
      provide foundations for the development of child-focused public policies. 
      METHODS: We conducted a critical interpretive synthesis of academic literature on 
      the normative dimensions of child health and social policy-making. We employed a 
      social constructivist lens to interpret emergent themes. Political theory on the 
      social construction of target populations served as a bridge between sociologies 
      of childhood and public policy analysis. RESULTS: Our database searches returned 
      14,658 unique articles; full text review yielded 72 relevant articles. Purposive 
      sampling of relevant literature complemented our electronic searches, adding 51 
      original articles, for a total of 123 articles. Our analysis of the literature 
      reveals three central themes: potential, rights, and risk. These themes retain 
      relevance in diverse policy domains. A core set of foundational concepts also 
      cuts across disciplines: well-being, participation, and best interests of the 
      child inform debate on the moral and legal dimensions of a gamut of child social 
      policies. Finally, a meta-theme of embedding encompasses the pervasive issue of a 
      child's place, in the family and in society, which is at the heart of much social 
      theory and applied analysis on children and childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Foundational 
      understanding of the moral language and dominant policy frames applied to 
      children can enrich analyses of social policies for children. Most societies 
      paint children as potent, vulnerable, entitled, and embedded. It is the admixture 
      of these elements in particular policy spheres, across distinct places and times, 
      that often determines the form of a given policy and societal reactions to it. 
      Subsequent work in this area will need to detail the degree and impact of 
      variance in the values mix attached to children across sociocultural contexts and 
      investigate tensions between what are and what ought to be the values that guide 
      social policy development for children.

TI  - An institutional ethnographic analysis of public and patient engagement 
      activities at a national health technology assessment agency.

LID - 10.1017/S0266462321000088 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The practice of public and patient engagement (PPE) in health 
      technology assessment (HTA) has spread worldwide, yet gaps in knowledge remain. 
      We carried out an institutional ethnography of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and 
      Technologies in Health (CADTH) public and patient involvement in HTA. METHODS: 
      The research took place over 15 months and included observational work in the 
      institutional settings, text review, and interviews with individuals working for 
      or involved with the agency. RESULTS: We found that despite demonstrated 
      commitment to PPE, organizational history, governance structure, and practices 
      were impediments to a unified approach to PPE. Unclear role descriptions for 
      committee members and differences in philosophy and priority given to PPE across 
      the organization presented challenges to effective participation. The high degree 
      of value given to evidence-based principles at times conflicted with meaningful 
      integration of patient input. A lack of clear goals and processes, roles, and 
      differential treatment of evidence in PPE served to minimize the importance of 
      patient experiences and to displace their validity. An acknowledgment of 
      conflicts between multiple epistemic traditions at work within HTA activities may 
      strengthen organizational approaches to PPE. CONCLUSION: HTA organizations can 
      learn from this study by reflecting on the challenges described and the 
      recommendations offered to address them. We suggest solidifying CADTH's 
      commitment to PPE with clear agency-wide roles and direction, values, and 
      outcomes, a comprehensive framework, and policy and procedures. An acknowledgment 
      of diverse epistemic traditions, as well as leadership and expertise in PPE, will 
      strengthen CADTH's PPE activities and sustain its leadership position in the HTA 
      field.

TI  - Barriers to Equitable Public Participation in Health-System Priority Setting 
      Within the Context of Decentralization: The Case of Vulnerable Women in a Ugandan 
      District.
PG  - 1047-1057
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decentralization of healthcare decision-making in Uganda led to the 
      promotion of public participation. To facilitate this, participatory structures 
      have been developed at sub-national levels. However, the degree to which the 
      participation structures have contributed to improving the participation of 
      vulnerable populations, specifically vulnerable women, remains unclear. We aim to 
      understand whether and how vulnerable women participate in health-system priority 
      setting; identify any barriers to vulnerable women's participation; and to 
      establish how the barriers to vulnerable women's participation can be addressed. 
      METHODS: We used a qualitative description study design involving interviews with 
      district decision-makers (n=12), sub-county leaders (n=10), and vulnerable women 
      (n=35) living in Tororo District, Uganda. Data was collected between May and June 
      2017. The analysis was conducting using an editing analysis style. RESULTS: The 
      vulnerable women expressed interest in participating in priority setting, 
      believing they would make valuable contributions. However, both decision-makers 
      and vulnerable women reported that vulnerable women did not consistently 
      participate in decision-making, despite participatory structures that were 
      instituted through decentralization. There are financial (transportation and lack 
      of incentives), biomedical (illness/disability and menstruation), knowledge-based 
      (lack of knowledge and/or information about participation), motivational 
      (perceived disinterest, lack of feedback, and competing needs), socio-cultural 
      (lack of decision-making power), and structural (hunger and poverty) barriers 
      which hamper vulnerable women's participation. CONCLUSION: The identified 
      barriers hinder vulnerable women's participation in health-system priority 
      setting. Some of the barriers could be addressed through the existing 
      decentralization participatory structures. Respondents made both short-term, 
      feasible recommendations and more systemic, ideational recommendations to improve 
      vulnerable women's participation. Integrating the vulnerable women's creative and 
      feasible ideas to enhance their participation in health-system decision-making 
      should be prioritized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine if there is an impact of 
      surgical delay on 5-year overall survival (OS) from early stage colon cancer, and 
      if so, to define how long surgery can safely be postponed. METHODS: Using the 
      NCDB, we compared early (14-30 days) and delayed surgery (31-90 days) in patients 
      with Stage I/II colon cancer. Outcomes included OS at five years and odds of 
      death. RESULTS: Delayed resection conferred a decreased 5-year OS of 73.0% (95% 
      CI, 72.6-73.4), compared to early resection 78.3% (95% CI, 77.9-78.8). When time 
      to surgery was divided into one-week intervals, there was no difference in the 
      odds of death with delay up to 35-41 days (6 weeks), but odds of death increased 
      by 9% per week thereafter. CONCLUSIONS: These data support that definitive 
      resection for early stage colon cancer may be safely delayed up to 6 weeks.

TI  - Developing a Canadian evaluation framework for patient and public engagement in 
      research: study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement (PPE) in research is growing 
      internationally, and with it, the interest for its evaluation. In Canada, the 
      Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research has generated national momentum and 
      opportunities for greater PPE in research and health-system transformation. As is 
      the case with most countries, the Canadian research community lacks a common 
      evaluation framework for PPE, thus limiting our capacity to ensure integrity 
      between principles and practices, learn across projects, identify common areas 
      for improvement, and assess the impacts of engagement. OBJECTIVE: This project 
      aims to build a national adaptable framework for the evaluation of PPE in 
      research, by: 1. Building consensus on common evaluation criteria and indicators 
      for PPE in research; 2. Defining recommendations to implement and adapt the 
      framework to specific populations. METHODS: Using a collaborative action-research 
      approach, a national coalition of patient-oriented research leaders, (patient and 
      community partners, engagement practitioners, researchers and health system 
      leaders) will co-design the evaluation framework. We will develop core evaluation 
      domains of the logic model by conducting a series of virtual consensus meetings 
      using a nominal group technique with 50 patient partners and engagement 
      practitioners, identified through 18 national research organizations. We will 
      then conduct two Delphi rounds to prioritize process and impact indicators with 
      200 participants purposely recruited to include respondents from seldom-heard 
      groups. Six expert working groups will define recommendations to implement and 
      adapt the framework to research with specific populations, including Indigenous 
      communities, immigrants, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, 
      caregivers, and people with low literacy. Each step of framework development will 
      be guided by an equity, diversity and inclusion approach in an effort to ensure 
      that the participants engaged, the content produced, and the adaptation 
      strategies proposed are relevant to diverse PPE. DISCUSSION: The potential 
      contributions of this project are threefold: 1) support a national learning 
      environment for engagement by offering a common blueprint for collaborative 
      evaluation to the Canadian research community; 2) inform the international 
      research community on potential (virtual) methodologies to build national 
      consensus on common engagement evaluation frameworks; and 3) illustrate a shared 
      attempt to engage patients and researchers in a strategic national initiative to 
      strengthen evaluation capacity for PPE.

AB  - PURPOSE: In this paper, we contribute to the theorizing of patient involvement in 
      organizational improvement by exploring concepts of "learning from patients" as 
      mechanisms of organizational change. Using the concept of metaphor as a 
      theoretical bridge, we analyse interview data (n = 20) from participants in 
      patient engagement activities from two case study organizations in Ontario, 
      Canada. Inspired by classic organizational scholars, we ask "what is the 
      organization that it might learn from patients?" DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: 
      Patient involvement activities are used as part of quality improvement efforts in 
      healthcare organizations worldwide. One fundamental assumption underpinning this 
      activity is the notion that organizations must "learn from patients" in order to 
      enact positive organizational change. Despite this emphasis on learning, there is 
      a paucity of research that theorizes learning or connects concepts of learning to 
      organizational change within the domain of patient involvement. FINDINGS: Through 
      our analysis, we interpret a range of metaphors of the organization, including 
      organizations as (1) power and politics, (2) systems and (3) narratives. Through 
      these metaphors, we display a range of possibilities for interpreting how 
      organizations might learn from patients and associated implications for 
      organizational change. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This analysis has implications for how 
      the framing of the organization matters for concepts of learning in patient 
      engagement activities and how misalignments might stymie engagement efforts. We 
      argue that the concept and commitment to "learning from patients" would be 
      enriched by further engagement with the sociology of knowledge and critical 
      concepts from theories of organizational learning.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Regionalization of rectal cancer surgery may lead to worse disease 
      free survival owing to longer travel time to reach a high volume center yet no 
      study has evaluated this relationship at a single high volume center volume 
      center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of rectal cancer 
      patients undergoing surgery from 2009 to 2019 at a single high volume center. 
      Patients were divided into two groups based on travel time. The primary outcome 
      was disease-free survival (DFS). Additional outcomes included treatment within 60 
      d of diagnosis, completeness of preoperative staging, and evaluation by a 
      colorectal surgeon prior to initiation of treatment. RESULTS: A lower proportion 
      of patients with long travel time began definitive treatment within 60 d of 
      diagnosis (74.0% versus 84.0%, P= 0.01) or were seen by the treating colorectal 
      surgeon before beginning definitive treatment (74.8% versus 85.4%, P < 0.01). On 
      multivariable logistic regression analysis, patients with long travel time were 
      significantly less likely to begin definitive treatment within 60 d of diagnosis 
      (OR = 0.54; 95% CI = 0.31-0.93) or to be evaluated by a colorectal surgeon prior 
      to initiating treatment (OR = 0.45; 95% CI = 0.25-0.80). There were no 
      significant differences in DFS based on travel time. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      patients with long travel times may be vulnerable to delayed, lower quality 
      rectal cancer care, there is no difference in DFS when definitive surgery is 
      performed at a high volume canter. Ongoing research is needed to identify 
      explanations for delays in treatment to ensure all patients receive the highest 
      quality care.

AB  - Glucocorticoids exert profound effects on the brain and behavior, but cortisol 
      concentrations are rarely linked to subjectively reported emotional states in 
      humans. This study examined whether the link between cortisol and subjective 
      anxiety varied by childhood maltreatment history. To do this, 97 individuals 
      (60.8% female) participated in a standardized stress task in the laboratory 
      (Trier Social Stress Test, TSST) while providing serial ratings of their feelings 
      of anxiety as well as cortisol samples in blood. These measurements were 
      collected nine times across the laboratory visit, from immediately before the 
      TSST to 65 minutes after stress initiation. We estimated the within-person 
      association between cortisol concentrations and momentary feelings of anxiety for 
      individuals with and without exposure to childhood maltreatment, measured via 
      self-report on the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Individuals exposed to 
      maltreatment during childhood reported the greatest feelings of anxiety when 
      cortisol concentrations were lowest. This pattern was exaggerated among female 
      participants, those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and those exposed 
      to emotional neglect relative to other forms of maltreatment. Early life 
      adversity, such as parental maltreatment, may alter the role of cortisol in 
      affective experiences. This observation may provide preliminary, translational 
      evidence of a novel pathway through which stress may lead to and maintain 
      internalizing symptoms in humans. More studies accounting for the moderating role 
      of childhood maltreatment in biobehavioral pathways are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigate whether older adults who were newly diagnosed with 
      dementia (severity unspecified) and resided in an assisted living facility that 
      offered a dementia care program had a lower rate of transition to a nursing home, 
      compared to those who resided in an assisted living facility without such a 
      program. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Linked, person-level health system administrative data on older 
      adults who were newly diagnosed with dementia and resided in an assisted living 
      facility in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2019 (n = 977). METHODS: Access to a 
      dementia care program in an assisted living facility (n = 57) was examined. 
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors 
      clustered on the assisted living facility was used to model the time to 
      transition to a nursing home from the new dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 
      11.8 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program, compared 
      with 20.5 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults 
      who resided in an assisted living facility without a dementia care program. After 
      adjustment for relevant characteristics at baseline, older adults who resided in 
      an assisted living facility with a dementia care program had a 40% lower rate of 
      transition to a nursing home (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 
      0.81), compared with those in an assisted living facility without such a program 
      at any point during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The rate 
      of transition to a nursing home was significantly lower among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility that offered a dementia care program. 
      These findings support the expansion of dementia care programs in assisted living 
      facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many residents of assisted living facilities live with dementia, but 
      little is known about the characteristics of assisted living facilities that 
      provide specialized care for older adults who live with dementia. In this study, 
      we identify the characteristics of assisted living facilities that offer a 
      dementia care program, compared to those that do not offer such a program. 
      METHODS: We conducted a population-level cross-sectional study on all licensed 
      assisted living facilities in Ontario, Canada in 2018 (n = 738). Facility-level 
      characteristics (e.g., resident and suite capacities, etc.) and the provision of 
      the other 12 provincially regulated care services (e.g., pharmacist and medical 
      services, skin and wound care, etc.) attributed to assisted living facilities 
      were examined. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was 
      used to model the characteristics of assisted living facilities associated with 
      the provision of a dementia care program. RESULTS: There were 123 assisted living 
      facilities that offered a dementia care program (16.7% versus 83.3% no dementia 
      care). Nearly half of these facilities had a resident capacity exceeding 140 
      older adults (44.7% versus 21.6% no dementia care) and more than 115 suites 
      (46.3% versus 20.8% no dementia care). All assisted living facilities that 
      offered a dementia care program also offered nursing services, meals, assistance 
      with bathing and hygiene, and administered medications. After adjustment for 
      facility characteristics and other provincially regulated care services, the 
      prevalence of a dementia care program was nearly three times greater in assisted 
      living facilities that offered assistance with feeding (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 
      2.91, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.98 to 4.29), and almost twice as great among 
      assisted living facilities that offered medical services (PR 1.78, 95% CI 1.00 to 
      3.17), compared to those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: A dementia care program was 
      more prevalent in assisted living facilities that housed many older adults, had 
      many suites, and offered at least five of the other 12 regulated care services. 
      Our findings deepen the understanding of specialized care for dementia in 
      assisted living facilities.

TI  - Priority setting and equity in COVID-19 pandemic plans: a comparative analysis of 
      18 African countries.
PG  - 297-309
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czab113 [doi]
AB  - Priority setting represents an even bigger challenge during public health 
      emergencies than routine times. This is because such emergencies compete with 
      routine programmes for the available health resources, strain health systems and 
      shift health-care attention and resources towards containing the spread of the 
      epidemic and treating those that fall seriously ill. This paper is part of a 
      larger global study, the aim of which is to evaluate the degree to which national 
      COVID-19 preparedness and response plans incorporated priority setting concepts. 
      It provides important insights into what and how priority decisions were made in 
      the context of a pandemic. Specifically, with a focus on a sample of 18 African 
      countries' pandemic plans, the paper aims to: (1) explore the degree to which the 
      documented priority setting processes adhere to established quality indicators of 
      effective priority setting and (2) examine if there is a relationship between the 
      number of quality indicators present in the pandemic plans and the country's 
      economic context, health system and prior experiences with disease outbreaks. All 
      the reviewed plans contained some aspects of expected priority setting processes 
      but none of the national plans addressed all quality parameters. Most of the 
      parameters were mentioned by less than 10 of the 18 country plans reviewed, and 
      several plans identified one or two aspects of fair priority setting processes. 
      Very few plans identified equity as a criterion for priority setting. Since the 
      parameters are relevant to the quality of priority setting that is implemented 
      during public health emergencies and most of the countries have pre-existing 
      pandemic plans; it would be advisable that, for the future (if not already 
      happening), countries consider priority setting as a critical part of their 
      routine health emergency and disease outbreak plans. Such an approach would 
      ensure that priority setting is integral to pandemic planning, response and 
      recovery.

      completion in individuals with major depressive disorder.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment effectiveness for major depressive disorder (MDD) is 
      often affected by client non-adherence, dropout, and non-response. Identification 
      of client characteristics predicting successful treatment completion and/or 
      response (i.e., symptom reduction) may be an important tool to increase 
      intervention effectiveness. It is unclear whether neural attenuations in reward 
      processing associated with MDD predict behavioral treatment outcome. METHODS: 
      This study aimed to determine whether blunted neural responses to reward at 
      baseline differentiate MDD (n = 60; 41 with comorbid anxiety) and healthy control 
      (HC; n = 40) groups; and predict MDD completion of and response to 7-10 sessions 
      of behavior therapy. Participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) 
      task. The N200, P300, contingent negative variation (CNV) event related 
      potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses (reaction time [RT], correct hits) 
      were quantified and extracted for cross-sectional group analyses. ERPs and 
      behavioral responses demonstrating group differences were then used to predict 
      therapy completion and response within MDD. RESULTS: MDD exhibited faster RT and 
      smaller P300 amplitudes than HC across conditions. Within the MDD group, 
      treatment completers (n = 37) exhibited larger P300 amplitudes than 
      non-completers (n = 21). LIMITATIONS: This study comprises secondary analyses of 
      EEG data; thus task parameters are not optimized to examine feedback ERPs from 
      the paradigm. We did not examine heterogenous presentations of MDD; however, 
      severity and comorbidity did not influence findings. CONCLUSIONS: Previous 
      studies suggest that P300 is an index of motivational salience and stimulus 
      resource allocation. In sum, individuals who deploy greater neural resources to 
      task demands are more likely to persevere in behavioral therapy.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on patient engagement in the health system: Results from a 
      Pan-Canadian survey of patient, family and caregiver partners.
PG  - 744-753
LID - 10.1111/hex.13421 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of the 
      health system. Little is known about how the activities and experiences of 
      patient, family and caregiver partners, as a large group across a variety of 
      settings within the health system, changed due to the substantial health system 
      shifts catalysed by the pandemic. This paper reports on the results of a survey 
      that included questions about this topic. METHODS: Canadian patient, family and 
      caregiver partners were invited to participate in an online anonymous survey in 
      the Fall of 2020. A virtual snowballing approach to recruitment was used. Survey 
      invitations were shared on social media and emailed to health system and 
      governmental organizations with the request that they share the survey with 
      patient partners. This paper focuses on responses to two questions related to 
      patient partner experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 
      questions were completed by 533 respondents. Over three quarters of respondents 
      (77.9%, n = 415) indicated their patient engagement activities had been impacted 
      by COVID-19. The majority (62.5%, n = 230) experienced at least a temporary or 
      partial reduction in their patient engagement activities. Some respondents did 
      see increases in their patient engagement activities (11.4%, n = 42). Many 
      respondents provided insights into their experience with virtual platforms for 
      engagement (n = 194), most expressed negative or mixed experiences with this 
      shift. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of Canadian patient, family 
      and caregiver partners' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their 
      engagement activities. Understanding how engagement unfolded during a crisis is 
      critical for our future planning if patient engagement is to be fully integrated 
      into the health system. Identifying how patient partners were engaged and not 
      engaged during this time period, as well as the benefits and challenges of 
      virtual engagement opportunities, offers instructive lessons for sustaining 
      patient engagement, including the supports needed to engage with a more diverse 
      set of patient, family and caregiver partners. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient 
      partners were important members of the Canadian Patient Partner Study research 
      team. They were engaged from the outset, participating in all stages of the 
      research project. Additional patient partners were engaged to develop and pilot 
      test the survey, and all survey respondents were patient, family or caregiver 
      partners. The manuscript is coauthored by two patient partners.

TI  - Mechanisms of Cardiometabolic Health Outcomes and Disparities: What 
      Characteristics of Chronic Stressors are Linked to HPA-Axis Dysregulation?
PG  - 448-459
LID - 10.1177/08982643221085903 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Chronic stressors are associated with cardiometabolic health 
      conditions and disparities. Mechanisms linking stressors and health remain poorly 
      understood. Methods: Two cohort studies (Cardiac Rehabilitation And The 
      Experience [CREATE] and Tracking Risk Identification for Adult Diabetes [TRIAD]) 
      with harmonized variables were used to examine relationships between six types of 
      chronic stressors in adulthood and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis 
      dysregulation, as indicated by blunted diurnal cortisol slopes, which are 
      stress-sensitive biomarkers implicated in cardiometabolic health (merged N = 213, 
      mean age 61, 18% Black). A secondary aim was to explore whether these chronic 
      stressors accounted for Black-White disparities in HPA axis regulation. Results: 
      Some chronic stressors were linked to HPA axis dysregulation, with recent 
      stressors most salient (b = 0.00353, SE = 0.00133, p = .008). Black-White 
      disparities in HPA axis regulation persisted after controlling for racial 
      differences in chronic stressors, which reduced the disparity 11.46%. Discussion: 
      Chronic stressors in adulthood may increase risk for HPA axis dysregulation and 
      associated cardiometabolic health outcomes but may not be a key factor in racial 
      disparities.

AB  - Objectives: To examine anxiety disorders in aging Black adults. Methods: Using 
      nationally representative data from the National Survey of American Life, we 
      estimated lifetime/12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in Black men and 
      women, age 50+ (N = 1561). Disorder-specific persistence and severity, functional 
      impairment, and mental health service utilization were investigated using 
      multivariate regressions. Results: Black men and women who met criteria for 
      anxiety disorders (lifetime prevalence=12.4%/18.3% in men/women) also 
      demonstrated persistent disorders (percent meeting criteria = 40.3%-61.2%). Those 
      with a 12-month anxiety disorder (6.2%/10.5% of men/women) typically reported 
      severe task interference (38.3%-85.7%). Those with any 12-month anxiety disorder, 
      compared to those without, experienced greater impairment in days out of role, 
      work, family burden, cognition and, in women, mobility (p's < .05). Only 
      47.0%/65.2% of Black men/women with any lifetime anxiety disorder used mental 
      health services. Discussion: Despite low prevalence, older Blacks with anxiety 
      disorders experience substantial mental health burden in middle age and later.

AB  - Objectives: To examine post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Black adults 
      in younger, middle, and older ages. Methods: Using nationally representative data 
      from the National Survey of American Life, we estimated lifetime and 12-month 
      prevalence of PTSD in Black men and women ages 18-34, 35-49, and 50+. We 
      determined PTSD persistence and severity by age group, then associations of PTSD 
      with socio-economic status, chronic stress, and racial discrimination in middle 
      age. Results: The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was higher in Black women/men ages 
      18-34 (prevalence=14.0%/6.3%) and 35-49 (12.8%/4.6%) versus 50 and older 
      (8.7%/5.1%). Those ages 35-49 were more likely than younger/older Black adults to 
      have severe interference in work, relationships, and activities domains. In 
      middle age, PTSD was associated with unemployment, lower education, poverty, and 
      stress in Black men, and unemployment, divorce, poverty, stress, and 
      discrimination in Black women. Discussion: Black women experience a 
      disproportionate burden of PTSD in middle age.

TI  - Rates of health services use among residents of retirement homes in Ontario: a 
      population-based cohort study.
PG  - E730-E738
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.211883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because there are no standardized reporting systems specific to 
      residents of retirement homes in North America, little is known about the health 
      of this distinct population of older adults. We evaluated rates of health 
      services use by residents of retirement homes relative to those of residents of 
      long-term care homes and other populations of older adults. METHODS: We conducted 
      a retrospective cohort study using population health administrative data from 
      2018 on adults 65 years or older in Ontario. We matched the postal codes of 
      individuals to those of licensed retirement homes to identify residents of 
      retirement homes. Outcomes included rates of hospital-based care and physician 
      visits. RESULTS: We identified 54 733 residents of 757 retirement homes (mean age 
      86.7 years, 69.0% female) and 2 354 385 residents of other settings. Compared to 
      residents of long-term care homes, residents of retirement homes had 
      significantly higher rates per 1000 person months of emergency department visits 
      (10.62 v. 4.48, adjusted relative rate [RR] 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      2.55 to 2.67), hospital admissions (5.42 v. 2.08, adjusted RR 2.77, 95% CI 2.71 
      to 2.82), alternate level of care (ALC) days (6.01 v. 2.96, adjusted RR 1.51, 95% 
      CI 1.48 to 1.54), and specialist physician visits (6.27 v. 3.21, adjusted RR 
      1.64, 95% CI 1.61 to 1.68), but a significantly lower rate of primary care visits 
      (16.71 v. 108.47, adjusted RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.14). INTERPRETATION: 
      Residents of retirement homes are a distinct population with higher rates of 
      hospital-based care. Our findings can help to inform policy debates about the 
      need for more coordinated primary and supportive health care in privately 
      operated congregate care homes.

TI  - Designing and Implementing Deliberative Processes for Health Technology 
      Assessment: A Good Practices Report of a Joint HTAi/ISPOR Task Force.
PG  - e37
LID - 10.1017/S0266462322000198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Deliberative processes for health technology assessment (HTA) are 
      intended to facilitate participatory decision making, using discussion and open 
      dialogue between stakeholders. Increasing attention is being given to 
      deliberative processes, but guidance is lacking for those who wish to design or 
      use them. Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi) and ISPOR-The 
      Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research initiated a joint 
      Task Force to address this gap. METHODS: The joint Task Force consisted of 
      fifteen members with different backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise relevant 
      to the field. It developed guidance and a checklist for deliberative processes 
      for HTA. The guidance builds upon the few, existing initiatives in the field, as 
      well as input from the HTA community following an established consultation plan. 
      In addition, the guidance was subject to two rounds of peer review. RESULTS: A 
      deliberative process for HTA consists of procedures, activities, and events that 
      support the informed and critical examination of an issue and the weighing of 
      arguments and evidence to guide a subsequent decision. Guidance and an 
      accompanying checklist are provided for (i) developing the governance and 
      structure of an HTA program and (ii) informing how the various stages of an HTA 
      process might be managed using deliberation. CONCLUSIONS: The guidance and the 
      checklist contain a series of questions, grouped by six phases of a model 
      deliberative process. They are offered as practical tools for those wishing to 
      establish or improve deliberative processes for HTA that are fit for local 
      contexts. The tools can also be used for independent scrutiny of deliberative 
      processes.

TI  - Morning light treatment for traumatic stress: The role of amygdala reactivity 
      study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to trauma can result in various mental health disorders 
      including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although 
      psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies exist for the treatment of these disorders, 
      many individuals fail to receive treatment and among those who do, many remain 
      symptomatic. Therefore, it is critical to continue developing new interventions 
      for traumatic stress that target underlying mechanisms of pathology and offer a 
      safe and acceptable alternative to current treatments. Morning light treatment 
      has good potential as a novel non-invasive, low risk treatment for traumatic 
      stress. Evidence suggests that morning light may improve traumatic stress by 
      reducing reactivity in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in the 
      pathophysiology of PTSD and anatomically linked to circadian photoreceptors in 
      the eye. METHODS: In this study, we aim to establish a significant dose-response 
      relationship between duration of morning light treatment and reduction in 
      amygdala reactivity among individuals with traumatic stress symptoms (NCT# 
      04117347). Using a transdiagnostic approach, sixty-six individuals with a history 
      of a DSM-5 criterion A trauma and traumatic stress symptoms will be recruited to 
      participate in a 5-week study. Participants will be randomized across three 
      treatment arms based on morning light treatment duration: 15-minutes, 30-minutes, 
      or 60-minutes of light treatment per day for four weeks. To evaluate amygdala 
      activity, participants will undergo fMRI at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and 
      post-treatment. Participants will also complete clinical assessments and 
      self-report measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety at pre-treatment, 
      mid-treatment, and post-treatment. DISCUSSION: Morning light therapy may be an 
      acceptable, feasible, and effective treatment for individuals suffering from 
      traumatic stress. Identifying mechanistically relevant targets, and the doses 
      needed to impact them, are critical steps in developing this new treatment 
      approach for the sequelae of traumatic stress.

AB  - Black adolescent boys experience mental health challenges because of their 
      exposure to a greater frequency and severity of psychosocial stressors. This 
      study used a sample of Black boys at a high school in southeastern Michigan as a 
      case study to understand the types of resources Black boys might use to support 
      their mental health. After conducting a rigorous analysis of the study data using 
      a rapid and an accelerated data reduction technique, four themes helped us answer 
      the question: What kinds of mental health support resources are Black boys using? 
      Four themes emerged from our analysis: online resources, community and trusted 
      individuals, self-reliance, and additional needs. This case study is a 
      springboard for further work to tailor a mental health education and support 
      intervention, such as the YBMen Project, for Black boys and for building 
      additional support amid the multiple crises occurring that impact their mental 
      health and safety. Findings have implications for future research, practice, and 
      policy to improve the mental health of Black boys in high school.

TI  - A multi-institutional study from the US ROPE Consortium examining factors 
      associated with directly entering practice upon residency graduation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is concern regarding the competency of today's general surgery 
      graduates as a large proportion defer independent practice in favor of additional 
      fellowship training. Little is known about the graduates who directly enter 
      general surgery practice and if their operative experiences during residency 
      differ from graduates who pursue fellowship. METHODS: Nineteen Accreditation 
      Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited general surgery programs from 
      the US Resident OPerative Experience Consortium were included. Demographics, 
      career choice, and case logs from graduates between 2010 to 2020 were analyzed. 
      RESULTS: There were 1,264 general surgery residents who graduated over the 
      11-year period. A total of 248 (19.6%) went directly into practice and 1,016 
      (80.4%) pursued fellowship. Graduates directly entering practice were more likely 
      to be a high-volume resident (43.1% vs 30.5%, P < .01) and graduate from a 
      high-volume program (49.2% vs 33.0%, P < .01). Direct-to-practice graduates 
      performed 53 more cases compared with fellowship-bound graduates (1,203 vs 1,150, 
      P < .01). On multivariable analysis, entering directly into practice was 
      positively associated with total surgeon chief case volume (odds ratio = 1.47, 
      95% confidence interval 1.18-1.84, P < .01) and graduating from a US medical 
      school (odds ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval 1.45-4.44, P < .01) while 
      negatively associated with completing a dedicated research experience (odds 
      ratio = 0.31, 95% confidence interval 0.22-0.45, P < .01). CONCLUSION: This is 
      the first multi-institutional study exploring resident operative experience and 
      career choice. These data suggest residents who desire immediate practice can 
      tailor their experience with less research time and increased operative volume. 
      These data may be helpful for programs when designing their experience for 
      residents with different career goals.

TI  - Primary aim results of a clustered SMART for developing a school-level, adaptive 
      implementation strategy to support CBT delivery at high schools in Michigan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Schools increasingly provide mental health services to students, but 
      often lack access to implementation strategies to support school-based (and 
      school professional [SP]) delivery of evidence-based practices. Given substantial 
      heterogeneity in implementation barriers across schools, development of adaptive 
      implementation strategies that guide which implementation strategies to provide 
      to which schools and when may be necessary to support scale-up. METHODS: A 
      clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment randomized trial (SMART) of high 
      schools across Michigan was used to inform the development of a school-level 
      adaptive implementation strategy for supporting SP-delivered cognitive behavioral 
      therapy (CBT). All schools were first provided with implementation support 
      informed by Replicating Effective Programs (REP) and then were randomized to add 
      in-person Coaching or not (phase 1). After 8 weeks, schools were assessed for 
      response based on SP-reported frequency of CBT delivered to students and/or 
      barriers reported. Responder schools continued with phase 1 
      implementation strategies. Slower-responder schools (not providing >/= 3 CBT 
      components to >/=10 students or >2 organizational barriers identified) were 
      re-randomized to add Facilitation to current support or not (phase 2). The 
      primary aim hypothesis was that SPs at schools receiving the REP + Coaching + 
      Facilitation adaptive implementation strategy would deliver more CBT sessions 
      than SPs at schools receiving REP alone. Secondary aims compared four 
      implementation strategies (Coaching vs no Coaching x Facilitation vs no 
      Facilitation) on CBT sessions delivered, including by type (group, brief and full 
      individual). Analyses used a marginal, weighted least squares approach developed 
      for clustered SMARTs. RESULTS: SPs (n = 169) at 94 high schools entered the 
      study. N = 83 schools (88%) were slower-responders after phase 1. Contrary to the 
      primary aim hypothesis, there was no evidence of a significant difference in CBT 
      sessions delivered between REP + Coaching + Facilitation and REP alone (111.4 vs. 
      121.1 average total CBT sessions; p = 0.63). In secondary analyses, the adaptive 
      strategy that offered REP + Facilitation resulted in the highest average CBT 
      delivery (154.1 sessions) and the non-adaptive strategy offering REP + Coaching 
      the lowest (94.5 sessions). CONCLUSIONS: The most effective strategy in terms of 
      average SP-reported CBT delivery is the adaptive implementation strategy that (i) 
      begins with REP, (ii) augments with Facilitation for slower-responder schools 
      (schools where SPs identified organizational barriers or struggled to deliver 
      CBT), and (iii) stays the course with REP for responder schools. TRIAL

TI  - Defining the Assisted Living Sector in Canada: An Environmental Scan.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we (1) identify the terms used to describe the 
      assisted living sector and the legislation governing operation in all Canadian 
      provinces and territories; (2) identify the cost estimates associated with 
      residency in these homes; and (3) quantify the growth of the sector. DESIGN: 
      Environmental scan. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Internet searches of Canadian 
      provincial and territorial government websites and professional associations were 
      conducted in 2021 to retrieve publicly accessible sources related to the assisted 
      living sector. METHODS: We synthesized data that identified the terms used to 
      describe the sector in all provinces and territories, the legislation governing 
      operation, financing, median fees per month for care, and growth of the sector 
      from 2012 to 2020. Counts and proportions were calculated for some extracted 
      variables. All data were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: The terms used to 
      describe the assisted living sector varied across Canada. The terms "assisted 
      living," "retirement homes," and "supportive living" were prevalent. Ontario was 
      the only province to regulate the sector through an independent, not-for-profit 
      organization. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta had some of the highest 
      median fees for room, board, and care per month (range: $1873 to $6726). The 
      licensed assisted living sector in Ontario doubled in size (768 in 2020 vs 383 in 
      2012), and there was a threefold increase in the number of corporate-owned chain 
      assisted living facilities (465 in 2020 vs 142 in 2012). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The rapid growth of the assisted living sector that is primarily 
      financed through out-of-pocket payments may indicate a rise in a two-tier system 
      of housing and health care for older adults. Policymakers need better mechanisms, 
      such as standardized reporting systems and assessments, to understand the needs 
      of older adults who reside in assisted living facilities and inform the need for 
      sector regulation and oversight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Standardized letters of recommendation (SLOR) are hypothesized to 
      decrease bias and provide consistent domains for evaluation. However, their 
      ability to differentiate among applicants is unknown. The utilization and 
      functionality of SLOR and the impact of SLOR domain rating on matching for colon 
      and rectal surgery (CRS) residency applicants have yet to be assessed. DESIGN: 
      Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis were employed. Applicants were 
      categorized into 3 groups; Top-tier(TT): applicants rated 100% Excellent/Very 
      Good; Mid-Tier(MT) applicants rated 80-99% Excellent/Very Good; and Non-Top 
      Tier(NTT) applicants rated <80% Excellent/Very Good. SETTING: University of 
      Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. PARTICIPANTS: SLORs submitted to a single 
      colorectal surgery residency in 2019 were analyzed RESULTS: A total of 101 
      applicants were included, 54 (53.5%) of the applicants were male. 75 (74.2%) 
      applicants who applied to our residency matched into a CRS residency, compared to 
      the national rate of 66%. Of the 101 applicants with SLOR, 54 (53.5%) were 
      categorized as TT, 26 (25.7%) as MT, and 21(20.8%) as NTT. The univariable 
      analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference in research 
      experience (p=0.029) and match status (p=0.01) between applicant tiers. There 
      were no statistically significant differences between applicant-tier and 
      demographics, foreign medical graduates (FMG), H-indices, ABSITE scores, type of 
      residency, preliminary year, completing an unaccredited CRS, and applicants with 
      an additional degree. On multivariable analysis age (OR=0.65; CI=0.48-0.87) and 
      FMG applicants (OR=0.05; CI=0.01-0.44) were inversely associated with 
      successfully matching. Compared to TT applicants, MT (OR=0.07; CI=0.01-0.57) and 
      NTT (OR=0.04; CI=0.01-0.34) applicants were inversely associated with a 
      successful match. Individuals who completed research prior to residency but after 
      medical school was associated with successfully matching (p=0.009). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The presence of MT and NTT ratings is associated with failure to match and may 
      represent an area of concern for CRS programs rather than a tool to discern 
      differences between candidates.

TI  - Understanding the Conceptualization and Operationalization of Trauma-Informed 
      Care Within and Across Systems: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis.
PG  - 785-853
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12579 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points In order to achieve successful operationalization of 
      trauma-informed care (TIC), TIC policies must include conceptual clarity 
      regarding the definition of both trauma and TIC. Furthermore, TIC requires clear 
      and cohesive policies that address operational factors such as clearly delineated 
      roles of service providers, protocol for positive trauma screens, necessary 
      financial infrastructure, and mechanisms of intersectoral collaboration. 
      Additionally, policy procedures need to be considered for how TIC is provided at 
      the program and service level as well as what TIC means at the organizational, 
      system, and intersectoral level. CONTEXT: Increased recognition of the 
      epidemiology of trauma and its impact on individuals within and across human 
      service delivery systems has contributed to the development of trauma-informed 
      care (TIC). How TIC can be conceptualized and implemented, however, remains 
      unclear. This study seeks to review and analyze the TIC literature from within 
      and across systems of care and to generate a conceptual framework regarding TIC. 
      METHODS: Our study followed a critical interpretive synthesis methodology. We 
      searched multiple databases (Campbell Collaboration, Econlit, Health Systems 
      Evidence, Embase, ERIC, HealthSTAR, IPSA, JSTOR, Medline, PsychINFO, Social 
      Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science),as well as 
      relevant gray literature and information-rich websites. We used a coding tool, 
      adapted to the TIC literature, for data extraction. FINDINGS: Electronic database 
      searches yielded 2,439 results and after inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
      applied, a purposive sample of 98 information-rich articles was generated. 
      Conceptual clarity and definitional understanding of TIC is lacking in the 
      literature, which has led to poor operationalization of TIC. Additionally, 
      infrastructural and ideological barriers, such as insufficient funding and 
      service provider "buy-in," have hindered TIC implementation. The resulting 
      conceptual framework defines trauma and depicts critical elements of vertical 
      TIC, including the bidirectional relationship between the trauma-affected 
      individual and the system, and horizontal TIC, which requires intersectoral 
      collaboration, an established referral network, and standardized TIC language. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Successful operationalization of TIC requires policies that address 
      current gaps in systems arrangements, such as the lack of funding structures for 
      TIC, and political factors, such as the role of policy legacies. The emergent 
      conceptual framework acknowledges critical factors affecting operationalization.

TI  - Striatal reactivity during emotion and reward relates to approach-avoidance 
      conflict behaviour and is altered in adults with anxiety or depression.
PG  - E311-E322
LID - 10.1503/jpn.220083 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously reported activation in reward, salience and 
      executive control regions during functional MRI (fMRI) using an 
      approach-avoidance conflict (AAC) decision-making task with healthy adults. 
      Further investigations into how anxiety and depressive disorders relate to 
      differences in neural responses during AAC can inform their understanding and 
      treatment. We tested the hypothesis that people with anxiety or depression have 
      altered neural activation during AAC. METHODS: We compared 118 treatment-seeking 
      adults with anxiety or depression and 58 healthy adults using linear 
      mixed-effects models to examine group-level differences in neural activation 
      (fMRI) during AAC decision-making. Correlational analyses examined relationships 
      between behavioural and neural measures. RESULTS: Adults with anxiety or 
      depression had greater striatal engagement when reacting to affective stimuli (p 
      = 0.008, d = 0.31) regardless of valence, and weaker striatal engagement during 
      reward feedback (p = 0.046, d = -0.27) regardless of the presence of monetary 
      reward. They also had blunted amygdala activity during decision-making (p = 
      0.023, d = -0.32) regardless of the presence of conflict. Across groups, approach 
      behaviour during conflict decision-making was inversely correlated with striatal 
      activation during affective stimuli (p < 0.001, r = -0.28) and positively related 
      to striatal activation during reward feedback (p < 0.001, r = 0.27). LIMITATIONS: 
      Our transdiagnostic approach did not allow for comparisons between specific 
      anxiety disorders, and our cross-sectional approach did not allow for causal 
      inference. CONCLUSION: Anxiety and depression were associated with altered neural 
      responses to AAC. Findings were consistent with the role of the striatum in 
      action selection and reward responsivity, and they point toward striatal 
      reactivity as a future treatment target. Blunting of amygdala activity in anxiety 
      or depression may indicate a compensatory response to inhibit affective salience 
      and maintain approach.

TI  - Resting-State Connectivity and Response to Psychotherapy Treatment in Adolescents 
      and Adults With OCD: A Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - 89-99
LID - 10.1176/appi.ajp.21111173 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cortical-subcortical hyperconnectivity related to affective-behavioral 
      integration and cortical network hypoconnectivity related to cognitive control 
      have been demonstrated in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD); the study 
      objective was to examine whether these connectivity patterns predict treatment 
      response. METHODS: Adolescents (ages 12-17) and adults (ages 24-45) were randomly 
      assigned to 12 sessions of exposure and response prevention (ERP) or stress 
      management therapy (SMT), an active control. Before treatment, resting-state 
      connectivity of ventromedial prefrontal cortical (vmPFC), cingulo-opercular, 
      frontoparietal, and subcortical regions was assessed with functional MRI. OCD 
      severity was assessed with the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale before, 
      during, and after treatment. Usable fMRI and longitudinal symptom data were 
      obtained from 116 patients (68 female; 54 adolescents; 60 medicated). RESULTS: 
      ERP produced greater decreases in symptom scores than SMT. ERP was selectively 
      associated with less vmPFC-subcortical (caudate and thalamus) connectivity in 
      both age groups and primarily in unmedicated participants. Greater symptom 
      improvement with both ERP and SMT was associated with greater cognitive-control 
      (cingulo-opercular and frontoparietal) and subcortical (putamen) connectivity 
      across age groups. Developmental specificity was observed across ERP and SMT 
      treatments, such that greater improvements with ERP than SMT were associated with 
      greater frontoparietal-subcortical (nucleus accumbens) connectivity in 
      adolescents but greater connectivity between frontoparietal regions in adults. 
      Comparison of response-predictive connections revealed no significant differences 
      compared with a matched healthy control group. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest 
      that less vmPFC-subcortical connectivity related to affect-influenced behavior 
      may be important for ERP engagement, whereas greater cognitive-control and motor 
      circuit connectivity may generally facilitate response to psychotherapy. Finally, 
      neural predictors of treatment response may differ by age.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the first surge of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare 
      utilization changed. We sought to examine the impact of the first COVID-19 surge 
      on the outcomes of patients whose elective surgeries for diverticulitis were 
      postponed and those who underwent urgent surgery during the surge. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study from a single tertiary center in the 
      Northeast of the US. Patients whose elective surgeries were delayed, or who 
      underwent urgent surgery for diverticulitis during the first COVID-19 surge 
      (3/16/2020 to 8/1/2020) were included. A cohort from 2019 was used for 
      comparison. Variables were compared between groups including: procedure, death, 
      length of stay, disposition, stoma rate, technique for surgery, and leak rate. 
      RESULTS: Forty-five patients were included in the COVID-19 group and 44 patients 
      in the 2019 group. Twenty-seven patients had elective surgeries delayed during 
      the COVID-19 surge. Ten (37%) required more urgent surgery, 80% with complicated 
      disease. Six (22%) were admitted to the hospital and 13 (48%) required additional 
      antibiotics. Eight (30%) patients postponed their surgeries indefinitely and 7 
      (26%) had surgery once permitted. There were no observed differences between the 
      two groups in the rate of complicated disease, leaks, technique for surgery or 
      stoma rate. CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 surge, over 1/3 of patients 
      whose elective diverticulitis surgeries were postponed required urgent surgery, a 
      majority of whom had complicated disease. There were no apparent differences in 
      outcomes when compared to a pre-pandemic cohort, highlighting the importance of a 
      triage system with the ability to escalate surgery in a timely manner.

TI  - Access to novel drugs and therapeutics for children and youth: Eliciting 
      citizens' values to inform public funding decisions.
PG  - 715-727

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The unique evidentiary, economic and ethical challenges associated 
      with health technology assessment (HTA) of precision therapies limit access to 
      novel drugs and therapeutics for children and youth, for whom such challenges are 
      amplified. We elicited citizens' perspectives about values-based criteria 
      relevant to the assessment of paediatric precision therapies to inform the 
      development of a child-tailored HTA framework. METHODS: We held four citizen 
      panels virtually in May-June 2021, informed by a plain-language citizen brief 
      summarizing global and local evidence about the challenges, policy and 
      programmatic options and implementation strategies related to enhancing access to 
      precision therapies for Canadian children and youth. Panellists were recruited 
      through a nationally representative database, medical/patient networks and social 
      media. We inductively coded and thematically analysed panel transcripts to 
      generate themes and identify priority values. RESULTS: The perspectives of 
      panellists (n = 45) coalesced into four overlapping themes, with attendant 
      subthemes, relevant to a child-tailored HTA framework: (1) Childhood 
      Distinctions: vulnerability, 'fair innings', future potential, family impacts; 
      (2) Voice: agency of children and youth; lived versus no lived experience; (3) 
      One versus Many: disease severity, rarity, equity, unmet need and (4) Health 
      System Governance: funding, implementation inequities, effectiveness and safety. 
      Participants broadly agreed that childhood distinctions, particularly family 
      impacts, justify child-tailored HTA. Dissent arose over whose voice should inform 
      HTA and how such perspectives are best incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens can 
      offer unique insights into criteria relevant to the development or revision of 
      HTA frameworks to capture holistic, societally responsive dimensions of value 
      attached to unique contexts or populations, including children. Balancing the 
      hopes and expectations of patients and caregivers for access to expensive but 
      potential life-altering therapies against the opportunity costs borne by 
      encompassing health systems is a fundamental challenge that will require rigorous 
      methods to elicit, weigh and reconcile varied views. PATIENT OR PUBLIC 
      CONTRIBUTION: A patient advocate served on the steering committee of this study 
      and co-authored this article. Key informants for the Citizen Brief included 
      patient advocates and caregivers; a separate patient advocate reviewed the Brief 
      before dissemination. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the 
      general public and caregivers of children, with written consent.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the sociodemographic characteristics, activities, 
      motivations, experiences, skills and challenges of patient partners working 
      across multiple health system settings in Canada. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional 
      survey of self-identified patient partners. SETTING: Patient partners in multiple 
      jurisdictions and health system organisations. PARTICIPANTS: 603 patient partners 
      who had drawn on their experiences with the health system as a patient, family 
      member or informal caregiver to try to improve it in some way, through their 
      involvement in the activities of a group, organisation or government. RESULTS: 
      Survey respondents predominantly identified as female (76.6%), white (84%) and 
      university educated (70.2%) but were a heterogeneous group in the scope 
      (activities and organisations), intensity (number of hours) and longevity (number 
      of years) of their role. Primary motivations for becoming a patient partner were 
      the desire to improve the health system based on either a negative (36.2%) or 
      positive (23.3%) experience. Respondents reported feeling enthusiastic (83.6%), 
      valued (76.9%) and needed (63.3%) always or most of the time; just under half 
      felt they had always or often been adequately compensated in their role. 
      Knowledge of the health system and the organisation they partner with are key 
      skills needed. Two-thirds faced barriers in their role with over half identifying 
      power imbalances. Less than half were able to see how their input was reflected 
      in decisions or changes always or most of the time, and 40.3% had thought about 
      quitting. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first of its kind to examine at a 
      population level, the characteristics, experiences and dynamics of a large sample 
      of self-identified patient partners. Patient partners in this sample are a 
      sociodemographically homogenous group, yet heterogeneous in the scope, intensity 
      and longevity of roles. Our findings provide key insights at a critical time, to 
      inform the future of patient partnership in health systems.

TI  - Towards conceptualizing patients as partners in health systems: a systematic 
      review and descriptive synthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the sharp increase in the involvement of patients (including 
      family and informal caregivers) as active participants, collaborators, advisors 
      and decision-makers in health systems, a new role has emerged: the patient 
      partner. The role of patient partner differs from other forms of patient 
      engagement in its longitudinal and bidirectional nature. This systematic review 
      describes extant work on how patient partners are conceptualized and engaged in 
      health systems. In doing so, it furthers the understanding of the role and 
      activities of patient partners, and best practices for future patient partnership 
      activities. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed 
      literature published in English or French that describes patient partner roles 
      between 2000 and 2021 in any country or sector of the health system. We used a 
      broad search strategy to capture descriptions of longitudinal patient engagement 
      that may not have used words such as "partner" or "advisor". RESULTS: A total of 
      506 eligible papers were identified, representing patient partnership activities 
      in mostly high-income countries. These studies overwhelmingly described patient 
      partnership in health research. We identified clusters of literature about 
      patient partnership in cancer and mental health. The literature is saturated with 
      single-site descriptive studies of patient partnership on individual projects or 
      initiatives. There is a lack of work synthesizing impacts, facilitating factors 
      and outcomes of patient partnership in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: There is not yet 
      a consolidated understanding of the role, activities or impacts of patient 
      partners. Advancement of the literature has been stymied by a lack of 
      consistently used terminology. The literature is ready to move beyond single-site 
      descriptions, and synthesis of existing pockets of high-quality theoretical work 
      will be essential to this evolution.

TI  - Discharge Prescribing Protocol Decreases Opioids in Circulation and Does Not 
      Increase Refills After Colorectal Surgery.
PG  - 840-847

AB  - BACKGROUND: Up to 10% of patients develop new, persistent opioid use after 
      surgery. We aimed to assess our prescribing practices and patient utilization of 
      opioids after colorectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to implement an 
      opioid-prescribing protocol that will minimize the number of postoperative 
      opioids to decrease community circulation and persistent use by patients. DESIGN: 
      This was a single-institution, prospective study based on questionnaires of 
      postoperative patients in 2019 and 2020 to determine opioid prescribing and usage 
      patterns. Based on these preliminary results, a protocol was implemented in which 
      patients were discharged with 5 or 15 oxycodone 5 mg equivalents based on opioid 
      usage in the 24 hours before discharge. Patients were surveyed after protocol 
      implementation. SETTINGS: Our institution is a large referral center for surgical 
      treatment of colorectal disease. PATIENTS: Adults who underwent inpatient 
      abdominal colorectal procedures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: End points included the 
      number of opioids prescribed, number of prescribed opioids taken, and refill 
      rate. Nonparametric testing was used. RESULTS: Of 77 eligible patients, 61 were 
      opioid naive. Preprotocol, opioid-naive patients (n = 29) were prescribed a 
      median of 30 (interquartile range [IQR], 30-45) tablets but took only 10 (IQR, 
      0-10; p < 0.0001). Eighty-three percent took 20 or fewer tablets. After protocol 
      implementation, opioid-naive patients (n = 32) were prescribed fewer tablets 
      (median 15; IQR, 7-15; p < 0.0001) but took a similar number of tablets as the 
      preprotocol group (median 10; IQR, 0-10; p = 0.21). The refill rate remained 
      similar (13.8% vs 18.8%; p = 0.60). Protocol adherence was 90.6%. LIMITATIONS: 
      This study is limited by sample size, cohort heterogeneity, and generalizability. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients took significantly fewer opioids than were prescribed. Our 
      protocol limited overprescribing and resulted in fewer opioids in the community 
      without opportunity costs such as increased refills. Long-term studies are needed 
      to assess the effects of persistent opioid use after surgery. See Video Abstract

OAB - ANTECEDENTES: Hasta el 10% de los pacientes desarrollan un nuevo uso persistente 
      de opioides despues de la cirugia. Nuestro objetivo fue evaluar nuestras 
      practicas de prescripcion y la utilizacion de opioides por parte de los pacientes 
      despues de la cirugia colorrectal. OBJETIVO: Nuestro objetivo es implementar un 
      protocolo de prescripcion de opioides que minimice la cantidad de opioides 
      posoperatorios para disminuir la circulacion en la comunidad y el uso persistente 
      por parte de los pacientes. DISENO: Estudio prospectivo, de una sola institucion, 
      basado en cuestionarios de pacientes postoperatorios en 2019 y 2020 para 
      determinar los patrones de prescripcion y uso de opioides. Con base en estos 
      resultados preliminares, se implemento un protocolo en el que los pacientes eran 
      dados de alta con 5 o 15 equivalentes de oxicodona de 5 mg segun el uso de 
      opioides en las 24 horas previas al alta. Los pacientes fueron encuestados 
      despues de la implementacion del protocolo. AJUSTES: Nuestra institucion es un 
      gran centro de referencia para el tratamiento quirurgico de la enfermedad 
      colorrectal. PACIENTES: Adultos que se sometieron a procedimientos colorrectales 
      abdominales con hospitalizacion. PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO: Los criterios 
      de valoracion incluyeron el numero de opioides recetados, el numero de opioides 
      recetados tomados y la tasa de reabastecimiento. Se utilizaron pruebas no 
      parametricas. RESULTADOS: De 77 pacientes elegibles, 61 no habian recibido 
      opioides. A los pacientes sin tratamiento previo con opioides antes del protocolo 
      (n = 29) se les prescribio una mediana de 30 (rango intercuartilico [RIC] 30-45) 
      comprimidos, pero solo tomaron 10 (RIC 0.10, p < 0,0001). El ochenta y tres por 
      ciento tomo </=20 comprimidos. Despues de la implementacion del protocolo, a los 
      pacientes sin tratamiento previo con opioides (n = 32) se les prescribieron menos 
      comprimidos (15; RIC 7.15, p < 0,0001), pero tomaron un numero similar antes de 
      la intervencion (10; RIC 0-10, p = 0,21). La tasa de reabastecimiento se mantuvo 
      similar (13,8% frente a 18,8%, p = 0,60). La adherencia al protocolo fue del 
      90,6%. LIMITACIONES: Este estudio esta limitado por el tamano de la muestra, la 
      heterogeneidad de la cohorte y la generalizacion. CONCLUSIONES: Los pacientes 
      tomaron significativamente menos opioides de los prescritos. Nuestro protocolo 
      limito la prescripcion excesiva y dio como resultados menos opioides en la 
      comunidad sin costos de oportunidad, como el aumento de reabastecimiento. Se 
      necesitan estudios a largo plazo para evaluar los efectos sobre el uso 
      persistente de opioides despues de la cirugia. Consulte Video Resumen en

TI  - Do diurnal salivary cortisol curves carry meaningful information about the 
      regulatory biology of the HPA axis in healthy humans?

AB  - Salivary cortisol stress biomarkers have been extensively used in epidemiological 
      work to document links between stress and ill health. There has been little 
      effort to ground field friendly cortisol measures in the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulatory biology that is likely 
      relevant to delineating mechanistic pathways leading from stress exposure to 
      detrimental health outcomes. Here, we utilized a healthy convenience sample 
      (n = 140) to examine normal linkages between extensively collected salivary 
      cortisol measures and available laboratory probes of HPA axis regulatory biology. 
      Participants provided 9 saliva samples per day over 6 days within a month, while 
      engaging in usual activities, and also participated in 5 regulatory tests 
      (adrenocorticoptripin stimulation, dexamethasone/corticotropin-releasing-hormone 
      stimulation, metyrapone, dexamethasone suppression, and Trier Social Stress 
      Test). Logistical regression was used to test specific predictions linking 
      cortisol curve components to regulatory variables and to explore widely for 
      non-predicted associations. We found support for 2 of 3 original hypotheses, 
      showing associations (1) between cortisol diurnal decline and feedback 
      sensitivity as measured by dexamethasone suppression, and (2) between morning 
      cortisol levels and adrenal sensitivity. We did not find links between central 
      drive (metyrapone test) and end of day salivary levels. We confirmed an a priori 
      expectation of limited linkage between regulatory biology and diurnal salivary 
      cortisol measures, beyond those predicted. These data support an emerging focus 
      on measures related to diurnal decline in epidemiological stress work. They raise 
      questions about the biological meaning of other curve components, including 
      morning cortisol levels, and perhaps CAR (Cortisol Awakening Response). If 
      morning cortisol dynamics are linked to stress, more work on adrenal sensitivity 
      in stress adaptation and stress-health links may be warranted.

TI  - The Presence of Implicit Gender Bias in Colon and Rectal Surgery Residency 
      Letters of Recommendation.
PG  - 848-856
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000002633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Selection for colorectal surgery residency relies on letters of 
      recommendation for assessment of candidates' strengths and weaknesses. It is 
      unclear whether this process incorporates implicit gender bias. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to assess the presence of gender bias in letters of recommendation 
      for colorectal surgery residency. DESIGN: Mixed methods assessment of the 
      characteristics described within the blinded letters of the 2019 application 
      cycle to a single academic residency. SETTINGS: Academic medical center. 
      PATIENTS: Blinded letters from the 2019 colorectal surgery residency application 
      cycle. INTERVENTIONS: Characteristics of the letters were qualitatively and 
      quantitatively analyzed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association of gender with the 
      presence of descriptors within the letters. RESULTS: A total of 111 applicants, 
      409 letter writers, and 658 letters were analyzed. Forty-three percent of 
      applicants were female. Female and male applicants had an equal mean number of 
      positive (5.4 vs 5.8; p = 0.10) and negative (0.5 vs 0.4; p = 0.07) attributes 
      represented. Female applicants were more likely to be described as having poor 
      academic skills (6.0 vs 3.4%; p = 0.04) and possessing negative leadership 
      qualities (5.2% vs 1.4%; p < 0.01) than male applicants. Male applicants were 
      more likely to be described as kind (36.6% vs 28.3%; p = 0.03), curious (16.4% vs 
      9.2%; p = 0.01), possessing positive academic skills (33.7% vs 20.0%; p < 0.01), 
      and possessing positive teaching skills (23.5% vs 17.0%; p = 0.04). LIMITATIONS: 
      This study analyzed a single year of applications to an academic center and may 
      not be generalizable. CONCLUSIONS: There are differences in the qualities used to 
      describe female versus male applicants in colorectal surgery residency 
      application letters of recommendation. Female applicants were more often 
      described in negative academic terms and possessing negative leadership 
      qualities. Males were more likely to be described as kind, curious, academically 
      impressive, and possessing good teaching skills. The field may benefit from

      PRESENCIA DE SESGO DE GNERO IMPLCITO EN LAS CARTAS DE RECOMENDACIN DE RESIDENCIA 
      EN CIRUGA DE COLON Y RECTO: ANTECEDENTES:La seleccion para la residencia en 
      cirugia colorrectal se basa en cartas de recomendacion para la evaluacion 
      subjetiva de las fortalezas y debilidades de los candidatos. No esta claro si 
      este proceso incorpora un sesgo de genero implicito.OBJETIVO:Evaluar la presencia 
      de sesgo de genero en las cartas de recomendacion para la residencia en cirugia 
      colorrectal.DISENO:Evaluacion de metodos mixtos de las caracteristicas descritas 
      dentro de las cartas selladas del ciclo de solicitud de 2019 a una sola 
      residencia academica.ENTORNO CLINICO:Centro medico academico.PACIENTES:Cartas 
      selladas del ciclo de solicitud de residencia en cirugia colorrectal de 
      2019.INTERVENCIONES:Las caracteristicas de las cartas se determinaron utilizando 
      medidas cualitativas y cuantitativas.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE VALORACION:Asociacion 
      del genero con la presencia de descriptores dentro de las cartas.RESULTADOS:Hubo 
      111 solicitantes, 409 escritores de cartas y se analizaron 658 cartas. El 43% de 
      los solicitantes eran mujeres. Los solicitantes masculinos y femeninos tenian el 
      mismo promedio de atributos positivos (5,4 frente a 5,8; p = 0,10) y negativos 
      (0,5 frente a 0,4; p = 0,07) representados. Las solicitantes femeninas tenian mas 
      probabilidades de ser descritas como con deficientes habilidades academicas (6,0 
      frente a 3,4%, p = 0,04) y poseian cualidades de liderazgo negativas (5,2% frente 
      a 1,4%; p < 0,01) en comparacion con los solicitantes masculinos. Los 
      solicitantes masculinos tenian mas probabilidades de ser descritos como amables 
      (36,6 % frente a 28,3%; p = 0,03), curiosos (16,4% frente a 9,2%; p = 0,01), que 
      poseian habilidades academicas positivas (33,7 % frente a 20,0%; p < 0,01), y 
      habilidades docentes positivas (23,5% vs 17,0%; p = 0,04).LIMITACIONES:Este 
      estudio analizo un solo ano de solicitudes a un centro academico y puede no ser 
      generalizable.CONCLUSION:Existen diferencias en las cualidades utilizadas para 
      describir a los solicitantes femeninos versus masculinos en las cartas de 
      recomendacion de solicitud de residencia en cirugia colorrectal. Las candidatas 
      femeninas se describieron con mayor frecuencia en terminos academicos negativos y 
      poseian cualidades de liderazgo negativas. Los hombres eran mas propensos a ser 
      descritos como amables, curiosos, academicamente impresionantes y con buenas 
      habilidades docentes. El campo puede beneficiarse de iniciativas educativas para 
      reducir el sesgo de genero implicito en las cartas de recomendacion. Consulte

TI  - Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Operative Experience Among General Surgery 
      Residents: A Multi-Institutional Study from the US ROPE Consortium.
PG  - 172-179
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005848 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between race/ethnicity and case volume 
      among graduating surgical residents. BACKGROUND: Racial/ethnic minority 
      individuals face barriers to entry and advancement in surgery; however, no 
      large-scale investigations of the operative experience of racial/ethnic minority 
      residents have been performed. METHODS: A multi-institutional retrospective 
      analysis of the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education case logs of 
      categorical general surgery residents at 20 programs in the US Resident OPerative 
      Experience Consortium database was performed. All residents graduating between 
      2010 and 2020 were included. The total, surgeon chief, surgeon junior, and 
      teaching assistant case volumes were compared between racial/ethnic groups. 
      RESULTS: The cohort included 1343 residents. There were 211 (15.7%) Asian, 65 
      (4.8%) Black, 73 (5.4%) Hispanic, 71 (5.3%) "Other" (Native American or Multiple 
      Race), and 923 (68.7%) White residents. On adjusted analysis, Black residents 
      performed 76 fewer total cases (95% CI, -109 to -43, P <0.001) and 69 fewer 
      surgeon junior cases (-98 to -40, P <0.001) than White residents. Comparing 
      adjusted total case volume by graduation year, both Black residents and White 
      residents performed more cases over time; however, there was no difference in the 
      rates of annual increase (10 versus 12 cases per year increase, respectively, P 
      =0.769). Thus, differences in total case volume persisted over the study period. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this multi-institutional study, Black residents graduated with 
      lower case volume than non-minority residents throughout the previous decade. 
      Reduced operative learning opportunities may negatively impact professional 
      advancement. Systemic interventions are needed to promote equitable operative 
      experience and positive culture change.

TI  - Development of the Engage with Impact Toolkit: A comprehensive resource to 
      support the evaluation of patient, family and caregiver engagement in health 
      systems.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1111/hex.13742 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent shifts in the patient, family and caregiver engagement field 
      have focused greater attention on measurement and evaluation, including the 
      impacts of engagement efforts. Current evaluation tools offer limited support to 
      organizations seeking to reorient their efforts in this way. We addressed this 
      gap through the development of an impact measurement framework and accompanying 
      evaluation toolkit-the Engage with Impact Toolkit. METHODS: The measurement 
      framework and toolkit were co-designed with the Evaluating Patient Engagement 
      Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of patient, family and caregiver 
      partners, engagement specialists, researchers and government personnel. Project 
      activities occurred over four phases: (1) project scoping and literature review; 
      (2) modified concept mapping; (3) working group deliberations and (4) toolkit web 
      design. RESULTS: The project scope was to develop a measurement framework and an 
      evaluation toolkit for patient engagement in health systems that were practical, 
      accessible, menu-driven and aligned with current system priorities. Concept 
      mapping yielded 237 impact statements that were sorted, discussed and combined 
      into 81 unique items. A shorter list of 50 items (rated 8.0 or higher out of 10) 
      was further consolidated to generate a final list of 35 items mapped across 8 
      conceptual domains of impact: (1) knowledge and skills; (2) confidence and trust; 
      (3) equity and inclusivity; (4) priorities and decisions; (5) effectiveness and 
      efficiency; (6) patient-centredness; (7) culture change and (8) patient outcomes 
      and experience. Working Group members rated the final list for importance (1-5) 
      and identified a core set of 33 items (one for each of the 8 domains and 25 
      supplementary items). Two domains (priorities and decisions; and culture change) 
      yielded the highest overall importance ratings (4.8). A web-based toolkit 
      (www.evaluateengagement.ca) hosts the measurement framework and related 
      evaluation supports. CONCLUSION: The Engage with Impact Toolkit builds on 
      existing engagement evaluation tools but brings a more explicit focus to 
      supporting organizations to assess the impacts of their engagement work. PATIENT 
      CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver partners led the early 
      conceptualization of this work and were involved at all stages and in all aspects 
      of the work. As end-users of the toolkit, their perspectives, knowledge and 
      opinions were critical.

TI  - Disparities in the Operative Experience Between Female and Male General Surgery 
      Residents: A Multi-institutional Study From the US ROPE Consortium.
PG  - 1-7
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000005847 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine differences in resident operative experience between male 
      and female general surgery residents. BACKGROUND: Despite increasing female 
      representation in surgery, sex and gender disparities in residency experience 
      continue to exist. The operative volume of male and female general surgery 
      residents has not been compared on a multi-institutional level. METHODS: 
      Demographic characteristics and case logs were obtained for categorical general 
      surgery graduates between 2010 and 2020 from the US Resident OPerative Experience 
      Consortium database. Univariable, multivariable, and linear regression analyses 
      were performed to compare differences in operative experience between male and 
      female residents. RESULTS: There were 1343 graduates from 20 Accreditation 
      Council for Graduate Medical Education-accredited programs, and 476 (35%) were 
      females. There were no differences in age, race/ethnicity, or proportion pursuing 
      fellowship between groups. Female graduates were less likely to be high-volume 
      residents (27% vs 36%, P < 0.01). On univariable analysis, female graduates 
      performed fewer total cases than male graduates (1140 vs 1177, P < 0.01), largely 
      due to a diminished surgeon junior experience (829 vs 863, P < 0.01). On adjusted 
      multivariable analysis, female sex was negatively associated with being a 
      high-volume resident (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.98, P = 0.03). Over the 
      11-year study period, the annual total number of cases increased significantly 
      for both groups, but female graduates (+16 cases/year) outpaced male graduates 
      (+13 cases/year, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Female general surgery graduates 
      performed significantly fewer cases than male graduates. Reassuringly, this gap 
      in operative experience may be narrowing. Further interventions are warranted to 
      promote equitable training opportunities that support and engage female 
      residents.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate lymph node (LN) excision is imperative for pathologic 
      staging and determination of adjuvant treatment. METHODS: he 2004-2017 National 
      Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for curative colon cancer resections. Tumors 
      were categorized by location: left, right, and transverse colon cancers. Adequate 
      (12-20 LNs) vs. inadequate (<12 LNs) lymphadenectomy was examined and 
      sub-analysis of <12 LNs, 12-20 LNs or >20 LNs. Primary outcome was predictors of 
      inadequate lymph node retrieval. RESULTS: Of 101,551 patients, 11.2% (11,439) had 
      inadequate lymphadenectomy. The inadequate lymphadenectomy rate steadily 
      decreased. On multivariable analysis, inadequate LN retrieval was associated with 
      transverse (OR 1.49, CI [1.30-1.71]) and left colon cancers (OR 2.66, CI 
      [2.42-2.93], whereas income >$63,333 had decreased likelihood of inadequate LN 
      retrieval (OR 0.68, CI[0.56-0.82]. CONCLUSION: We are making the grade as NCDB 
      data demonstrates a steady decrease in inadequate lymphadenectomy (2004-2017). 
      There remain socioeconomic risk factors for inadequate lymphadenectomy that need 
      to be addressed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nonoperative management (NOM) of locally advanced rectal cancer was 
      described as early as 2004. Initial national data demonstrated increase in 
      utilization of NOM from 1998 to 2010, but newer national utilization data are not 
      available. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study using the National 
      Cancer Database to assess utilization and 5-y overall survival (OS) of NOM of 
      locally advanced rectal cancer. All patients had American Joint Committee on 
      Cancer stage 2 or 3 rectal cancer, were over 40 y old, received both chemotherapy 
      and radiation therapy, and were not being treated with palliative intent. 
      RESULTS: 74,780 patients were analyzed. 64,540 (86.2%) underwent a definitive 
      resection, 10,330 (13.8%) had NOM. Utilization of NOM steadily increased from 
      11.3% in 2010 to 18.6% in 2018. Multivariate regression identified the highest 
      predictors of utilization of NOM to be uninsured status, government insurance, 
      Black race, and treatment at a community cancer center. Multivariate regression 
      identified NOM as the highest hazard for mortality (hazard ratio = 2.286, 
      confidence interval 2.209-2.366). After propensity score matching, the mean 
      estimated 5-y OS was 52.0% for those managed operatively compared to 39.8% for 
      those managed nonoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: From 2004 to 2018, the utilization of 
      NOM of locally advanced rectal cancer significantly increased. However, there was 
      a significant discrepancy in OS in comparison to surgical resection for these 
      patients. Further study is needed to determine the long-term oncologic safety of 
      NOM.

PG  - 73
LID - 10.1186/s40900-023-00491-w [doi]
LID - 73
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is a pan-Canadian research network 
      focused on innovating and improving the quality and delivery of pain prevention, 
      assessment, management and research for all Canadians. An important focus of the 
      CPN is to work in collaboration with patient partners. Patient partners, 
      researchers and clinicians work together in all aspects of the research network 
      including on funded research projects and in the governance of the Network. Given 
      this focus, the CPN identified the importance of evaluating their patient 
      engagement work to understand its functioning and impact. METHODS: The objective 
      of this exploratory evaluation case study was to understand the impacts of 
      patient engagement on the CPN. The CPN worked with an external evaluation team 
      which established an arms-length approach to the evaluation. Interviews were 
      conducted with CPN members, including patient partners, leadership, funded 
      researchers and committee co-chairs, at three discrete time points to trace the 
      evolution of the patient engagement program within the Network. Key Network 
      documents were also collected and reviewed. Data were analyzed following each set 
      of interviews using content analysis guided by the principles of constant 
      comparison and qualitative description. A final round of analysis was conducted 
      using the Engage with Impact Toolkit, an impact measurement framework, to 
      identify impacts of engagement. RESULTS: Impacts of patient engagement were 
      identified at the individual, network, funded research project and research 
      community levels. These impacts were observed in the following areas: (1) 
      building community; (2) developing knowledge, skills and resources; (3) 
      increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and decisions; (5) enabling 
      additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; and, (7) coping with 
      experiences of living with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: While not without 
      challenges, the patient engagement efforts of the CPN demonstrates the impact 
      engaging patient partners can have on a national research network and related 
      policy activities. Understanding the approaches to, and impacts of, patient 
      engagement on health research networks can illuminate the value of having patient 
      partners engaged in all aspects of a research network and should serve as 
      encouragement to others who look to take on similar work.

OAB - The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is one of a group of research networks that was 
      funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to support 
      patient-oriented research in chronic diseases. From the beginning of its work, 
      the CPN has included patients as partners. Patient partners are co-chairs of all 
      Network governance committees, funded projects are required to include patient 
      partners in their work and there is a committee dedicated to engagement, the 
      Patient Engagement (PE) committee. The PE Committee determined that it was 
      important to evaluate how the CPN was engaging with patient partners and 
      collaborated with the Public and Patient Engagement Collaborative (PPEC) to 
      evaluate this work. The PPEC, along with members of the PE Committee, identified 
      understanding the impact of patient engagement as an important part of the 
      evaluation. This paper provides a description of the impacts of patient 
      engagement on the people who were involved in the CPN, on the CPN's work and way 
      of being, and on the broader pain research community. Based on the results from 
      three sets of interviews and review of Network documents, we share impacts 
      identified in seven areas: (1) building community; (2) developing knowledge, 
      skills and resources; (3) increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and 
      decisions; (5) enabling additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; 
      and, (7) coping with experiences of living with chronic pain. This research shows 
      us the impact that engaging patient partners can have on a national research 
      network, and the areas where greater focus could, perhaps, lead to even greater 
      impacts in future networks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Functional alterations of tripartite neural networks during cognitive 
      control (i.e., frontoparietal network [FPN], cingulo-opercular network, and 
      default mode network) occur in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) 
      and may contribute to illness expression. However, the degree to which changes in 
      these networks are elicited by gold standard treatment (e.g., exposure and 
      response prevention [EX/RP]) remains unknown. Understanding how EX/RP modulates 
      network connectivity in adolescent versus adult patients with OCD may aid the 
      identification of developmentally sensitive treatment targets that enhance 
      cognitive control. METHODS: Data from a total of 169 adolescents (13-17 years) 
      and adults (25-40 years; 57% female) were analyzed, including healthy control 
      participants (n = 58) and patients with OCD (n = 111) who were randomized to 
      either EX/RP or an active control therapy (stress management training). 
      Participants performed a flanker task during functional magnetic resonance 
      imaging pre- and posttreatment. To retain sensitivity to individual differences 
      in connectivity, group iterative multiple model estimation was used to assess 
      functional connectivity (i.e., density) within and between brain networks. 
      RESULTS: Significant increases in FPN density and decreases in FPN-default mode 
      network density were observed from pre- to posttreatment in patients who received 
      EX/RP. The opposite patterns of change occurred in patients who received stress 
      management training. These treatment-related changes in network density did not 
      differ across age group. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest EX/RP-specific changes in 
      task-based connectivity in patients with OCD. Given baseline differences between 
      healthy control participants and patients by age group, these treatment-related 
      changes may indicate restoration of healthy FPN and default mode network 
      development across patients, providing targets for improving response to EX/RP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prior analyses of general surgery resident case logs have indicated a 
      decline in the number of endocrine procedures performed during residency. This 
      study aimed to identify factors contributing to the endocrine operative 
      experience of general surgery residents and compare those who matched in 
      endocrine surgery fellowship with those who did not. METHODS: We analyzed the 
      case log data of graduates from 18 general surgery residency programs in the US 
      Resident Operative Experience Consortium over an 11-year period. RESULTS: Of the 
      1,240 residents we included, 17 (1%) matched into endocrine surgery fellowships. 
      Those who matched treated more total endocrine cases, including more thyroid, 
      parathyroid, and adrenal cases, than those who did not (81 vs 37, respectively, P 
      < .01). Program-level factors associated with increased endocrine volume included 
      endocrine-specific rotations (+10, confidence interval 8-12, P < .01), 
      endocrine-trained faculty (+8, confidence interval 7-10, P < .01), and program 
      co-location with otolaryngology residency (+5, confidence interval 2 -8, P < .01) 
      or endocrine surgery fellowship (+4, confidence interval 2-6, P < .01). Factors 
      associated with decreased endocrine volume included bottom 50th percentile in 
      National Institute of Health funding (-10, confidence interval -12 to -8, P < 
      .01) and endocrine-focused otolaryngologists (-3, confidence interval -4 to -1, P 
      < .01). CONCLUSION: Several characteristics are associated with a robust 
      endocrine experience and pursuit of an endocrine surgery fellowship. Modifiable 
      factors include optimizing the recruitment of dedicated endocrine surgeons and 
      the inclusion of endocrine surgery rotations in general surgery residency.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of engaging older adults and service providers as research 
      partners in the co-design of a community mobility-promoting program: a mixed 
      methods developmental evaluation study.
PG  - 116

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly researchers are partnering with citizens and communities 
      in research; less is known about research impacts of this engagement. EMBOLDEN is 
      an evidence-informed, mobility-promoting intervention for older adults 
      co-designed by a 26-person Strategic Guiding Council (SGC) of health/social 
      service providers and older adult citizens. This study evaluated research 
      partners' perceptions of engagement strategies, the engagement context, 
      strengths, areas for improvement, as well as the impacts of the guiding council 
      on older-adult identified priority areas. METHODS: This study was guided by 
      developmental evaluation, working in partnership with four older adult SGC 
      members who helped to set evaluation priorities, decide methods, and adapt 
      patient-centred evaluation tools. Data sources included a questionnaire, focus 
      groups and document analysis of meeting notes from 16 SGC meetings that took 
      place between December 2019 and February 2022. A thematic approach to analysis 
      guided the coding of focus group transcripts and SGC meeting notes. Convergent 
      mixed methods guided the integration and presentation of qualitative and 
      quantitative data sources in a joint display of evaluation results. RESULTS: Of 
      26 SGC members, nine completed the evaluation squestionnaire, and five 
      participated in focus groups. Around two thirds of the SGC commonly attended each 
      meeting. EMBOLDEN's SGC was structured to include a diverse group (across gender, 
      ethnicity and discipline) of older adults and service providers, which was 
      perceived as a strength. Engagement processes were perceived as inclusive and 
      well-facilitated, which stimulated discussion at meetings. Advantages and 
      disadvantages of engaging with the SGC virtually, as compared to in-person (as 
      was the case for the first 3 SGC meetings) were also discussed. Impacts of the 
      SGC were identified across preparatory, execution phase and translational stages 
      of research. Impacts of SGC involvement on members were also described. 
      CONCLUSION: Older adult research partners played an important role designing, 
      implementing, and evaluating co-design approaches in this study. Older adults and 
      service providers can make important contributions to the design, delivery and 
      sharing results of health research through their lived expertise and connections 
      to community. This project contributes to the growing field of citizen and 
      community engagement in research by offering a participatory approach to 
      engagement evaluation that considers diversity, satisfaction, and impact.

OAB - It is becoming common for researchers to ask patients and caregivers to become 
      involved with their studies as partners. By partnering with people who have 
      first-hand experience with a condition, researchers hope their studies will be 
      more relevant, run efficiently and have more impact than studies designed by 
      researchers alone. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant 
      increase in the number of published papers that involve patients and caregivers, 
      but few papers mention what changed because of this involvement. Researchers need 
      to know the best ways to involve patients and caregivers and the impact of doing 
      so.This study aimed to find out how a council of older adults (OAs) and service 
      providers (SPs) impacted a study about collaboratively designing and testing a 
      mobility intervention. This study aimed to find out how council members felt 
      about their involvement in this study, by asking them what went well and what 
      could have been improved.This study used a questionnaire, focus groups and 
      analyzed council meeting notes to inform this study. Four OA council members 
      helped design the study, decide research methods, and adapt wording of questions 
      (focus groups, questionnaire). Between 19% and 35% of council members completed 
      evaluation activities. They felt the study strengths were the diversity of the 
      council, and a welcoming environment for discussion. The council impacted how the 
      study was designed, carried out and how results were shared. Results from this 
      study can improve patient partnership engagement, experiences, and impacts in 
      future studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Though exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a well-proven 
      treatment for OCD across the lifespan, prior RCTs have not studied adolescent and 
      adult patients with the same ERP protocol relative to an active comparator that 
      controls for non-specific effects of treatment. This approach assesses 
      differences in the effect of OCD-specific exposures in affected adolescents and 
      adults and in response to ERP compared to a stress-management control therapy 
      (SMT). METHODS: This assessor-blinded, parallel, 2-arm, randomized, ambulatory 
      clinical superiority trial randomized adolescents (aged 12-18) and adults (24-46) 
      with OCD (N = 126) to 12 weekly sessions of ERP or SMT. OCD severity was measured 
      before, during and after treatment using the child or adult version of the 
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (C/Y-BOCS), depending on participant age. 
      We predicted that ERP would produce greater improvement in OCD symptoms than SMT 
      and that there would be no significant post-treatment differences across age 
      groups. RESULTS: ERP (n = 63) produced significantly greater improvements on 
      C/Y-BOCS scores at post-treatment than SMT (n = 63) (Effect size = -0.72, 
      CI = -0.52 to -0.91, p < .001). ERP also produced more treatment responders 
      (ERP = 86%, SMT = 32%; chi(2) = 46.37, p < .001) and remitters than SMT (ERP = 39%, 
      SMT = 7%; chi(2) = 16.14, p < .001). Finally, there were no statistically 
      significant post-treatment differences in C/Y-BOCS scores between adolescents and 
      adults assigned to ERP. CONCLUSION: A single ERP protocol is superior to SMT in 
      treating both adolescents and adults with OCD. OCD-specific therapy is necessary 
      across the lifespan for optimal outcomes in this highly disabling disorder, 
      though non-specific treatments like SMT are still all-too-commonly provided.

TI  - A global comparative analysis of the the inclusion of priority setting in 
      national COVID-19 pandemic plans: A reflection on the methods and the 
      accessibility of the plans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the swift governments' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      there remains a paucity of literature assessing the degree to which; priority 
      setting (PS) was included in the pandemic plans and the pandemic plans were 
      publicly accessible. This paper reflects on the methods employed in a global 
      comparative analysis of the degree to which countries integrated PS into their 
      COVID-19 pandemic plans based on Kapiriri & Martin's framework. We also assessed 
      if the accessibility of the plans was related to the country's transparency 
      index. METHODS: Through a three stage search strategy, we accessed and reviewed 
      86 national COVID-19 pandemic plans (and 11 Canadian provinces and territories). 
      Secondary analysis assessed any alignment between the readily accessible plans 
      and the country's transparency index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 71 national plans 
      were readily accessible while 43 were not. There were no systematic differences 
      between the countries whose plans were readily available and those whose plans 
      were 'missing'. However, most of the countries with 'missing' plans tended to 
      have a low transparency index. The framework was adapted to the pandemic context 
      by adding a parameter on the need to plan for continuity of priority routine 
      services. While document review may be the most feasible and appropriate approach 
      to conducting policy analysis during health emergencies, interviews and follow up 
      document review would assess policy implementation.

TI  - A randomized clinical trial of behavioral activation and exposure-based therapy 
      for adults with generalized anxiety disorder.
LID - 100004 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Exposure-based therapy (EXP) and behavioral activation (BA) are 
      empirically-supported behavioral intervention techniques that target avoidance 
      and approach behavior to alleviate symptoms. Although EXP is an established 
      treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), the effectiveness of BA for GAD 
      has not been directly tested or compared with that of EXP. This study examined 
      the efficacy of EXP and BA for adults with GAD. METHOD: In a randomized clinical 
      trial (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02807480) with partial blinding in Tulsa, OK, 102 
      adults with GAD were allocated to manualized, 10-session EXP or BA between April 
      2016-April 2021. Primary analyses were intention-to-treat and included the 94 (46 
      EXP, 48 BA) participants who started treatment. The GAD-7 self-report scale was 
      the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Similar GAD-7 declines were observed at 
      post-treatment for EXP (d=-0.97 [95% CI -1.40 to -0.53]) and BA (d=-1.14 [95% CI 
      -1.57 to -0.70]), and were maintained through 6-month follow-up (EXP: d=-2.13, 
      BA: d=-1.98). Compared to EXP, BA yielded more rapid declines in anxiety and 
      depression scores during therapy (d=0.75-0.77), as well as lower anxiety and 
      depression scores (d=0.13-0.14) and greater participant-rated improvement 
      (d=0.64) at post-treatment. Bayesian analyses indicated 74-99% probability of 
      greater change in BA than EXP at post-treatment. CONCLUSIONS: BA and EXP are both 
      effective in treating GAD, and BA may confer greater benefit during treatment. 
      Future research is warranted to inform personalized treatment approaches.

AB  - Stakeholder participation is a key component of a fair and equitable 
      priority-setting in health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for fair 
      and equitable priority setting, and hence, stakeholder participation. To date, 
      there is limited literature on stakeholder participation in the development of 
      the pandemic plans (including the priority setting plans) that were rapidly 
      developed during the pandemic. Drawing on a global study of national COVID-19 
      preparedness and response plans, we present a secondary analysis of COVID-19 
      national plans from 70 countries from the six WHO regions, focusing on 
      stakeholder participation. We found that most plans were prepared by the Ministry 
      of Health and acknowledged WHO guidance, however less than half mentioned that 
      additional stakeholders were involved. Few plans described a strategy for 
      stakeholder participation and/or accounted for public participation in the plan 
      preparation. However, diverse stakeholders (including multiple governmental, 
      non-governmental, and international organizations) were proposed to participate 
      in the implementation of the plans. Overall, there was a lack of transparency 
      about who participated in decision-making and limited evidence of meaningful 
      participation of the community, including marginalized groups. The critical 
      relevance of stakeholder participation in priority setting requires that 
      governments develop strategies for meaningful participation of diverse 
      stakeholders during pandemics such as COVID-19, and in routine healthcare 
      priority setting.

TI  - Patient perspectives on pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for antidepressant 
      prescribing in primary care: a qualitative description study.
PG  - 293-309
LID - 10.1007/s12687-024-00705-y [doi]
AB  - Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) try multiple antidepressants 
      before finding one that works well and is tolerable. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) 
      testing was developed to facilitate more efficacious prescribing. This technology 
      has not been robustly implemented clinically. Patient perspectives are critical 
      to policy decisions, but the views of patients with MDD about the use of PGx 
      testing to guide antidepressant prescribing have not been extensively examined, 
      particularly in publicly funded healthcare systems. The purpose of this 
      qualitative description study was to produce actionable patient perspectives 
      evidence to inform future technology assessment of PGx testing. We conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with 21 adults with MDD for which antidepressants were 
      indicated in Ontario, Canada, and used the Ontario Decision Determinants 
      Framework to conduct an unconstrained deductive content analysis. Patients 
      expressed views about the overall clinical benefit of PGx testing in depression 
      care, preferences for deployment of testing, perspectives on ethical 
      considerations, opinions about equity and patient care, and beliefs regarding the 
      feasibility of adopting PGx testing into the healthcare system. They also worried 
      about the possibility of conflicts of interest between PGx test manufacturers and 
      pharmaceutical companies. This study provides policymakers with patient 
      priorities to facilitate the development of patient-centred policies. It 
      highlights that formal adoption of PGx testing into the healthcare system 
      requires a focus on equity of access and health outcomes.

AB  - Engagement of patients and the public in health research is crucial for ensuring 
      research relevance and alignment with community needs. However, there is a lack 
      of nuanced evaluations and examples that promote collaborative and reflective 
      learning about partnerships with partners. The aim of this paper is to provide a 
      case example of a participatory evaluation of the engagement of older adult 
      partners in an aging-focused research centre. We outline our process of 
      co-planning and implementing an evaluation of the McMaster Collaborative for 
      Health and Aging's engagement strategy through the use of multiple methods, 
      including a standardized tool and qualitative approaches. The team chose to 
      explore and capture the engagement experiences and perspectives of the older 
      adult partners within the Collaborative using a survey (the Public and Patient 
      Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET)), an art-based method (photovoice), and a 
      focus group. We present a brief summary of the findings but primarily focus this 
      paper on the experiences of using each methodology and tool, with an emphasis on 
      promoting dialogue on the benefits, limitations, and challenges. We reflect on 
      the process of co-planning and the integration of both standardized tools and 
      qualitative approaches to adopt a holistic approach to evaluating partnership 
      within the Collaborative. Ultimately, this case example aims to provide practical 
      guidance for other research groups navigating the complexities of partnership 
      engagement and evaluation, thereby promoting meaningful partnerships in research.

OAB - Engaging older adults in research is important to match research study goals with 
      older adult needs and interests and can lead to better health outcomes and a more 
      equitable healthcare system. Yet, older adults are often excluded from research 
      due to the idea that they can be a challenging group with whom to work. The 
      McMaster Collaborative for Health and Aging is a provincial research centre 
      established to engage patients, researchers, and other key partners to improve 
      the health of and the healthcare system for older adults. The Collaborative 
      partners with older adults and caregivers in all its activities and projects. For 
      example, older adults mentor students and advise on patient-partnered research 
      projects and co-facilitate workshops. There are many frameworks and models to 
      support research partnerships with people with lived experience. Yet, evaluating 
      the quality and impacts of these partnerships is less common. This paper presents 
      a case example of a participatory evaluation of older adult partners' engagement 
      in the Collaborative. Together, older adult partners and researchers decided on 
      the project goals and methods. The evaluation used multiple methods to capture 
      partners' experiences and perspectives on the process and impact of their 
      engagement in research. First, a survey called the Public and Patient Engagement 
      Evaluation Tool (PPEET) was completed. Second, photovoice was used (a method 
      involving photography for self-expression). Finally, a focus group was conducted 
      (discussions with partners facilitated by researchers). We reflect on the 
      benefits and limitations of each method and make recommendations for future 
      evaluations. The paper underscores considering partner preferences and abilities 
      when choosing evaluation methods for patient-partnered research.

TI  - Patient and public involvement in international research: Perspectives of a team 
      of researchers from six countries on collaborating with people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and end-of-life.
PG  - e13942

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a critical priority in 
      research, policy, academia and advocacy organizations. PPI in dementia research 
      is gaining momentum. However, these efforts are missing in international projects 
      aimed at those living with advanced dementia in long-term care (LTC) homes. 
      Additional complexities can arise in enacting PPI within the context of 
      integration of a palliative approach to care and experiences around end-of-life 
      in (EOL) dementia. The mySupport study involved implementing the Family Carer 
      Decision Support (FCDS) intervention for care partners of those living with 
      advanced dementia in LTC in six countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: An 
      interpretive description study was conducted to explore the perspectives of 
      international researchers from six countries on engaging people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and EOL care in research processes. The findings from 
      this study informed the development of a PPI strategy and a subsequent toolkit 
      for the FCDS intervention. FINDINGS: Thirty-eight interviews were completed with 
      project researchers: 12 from the United Kingdom, 8 from Canada, 7 from Ireland, 4 
      each from Italy and The Netherlands and 3 from the Czech Republic. Four broad 
      themes describe international researchers' perspectives on advancing methods of 
      engagement for people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL in international 
      PPI activities: (1) Groundwork to engage in research; (2) planning for research 
      activities is key; (3) focus on meaningful engagement and (4) having foresight 
      for practical issues shaping PPI. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: International 
      projects that involve PPI can present many sources of challenges. The findings in 
      this study highlight important considerations for foundational work for 
      incorporating PPI in international projects. Learning from world leaders and 
      those with lived experiences in various regions can be insightful and help share 
      tools and resources. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: PPI was envisioned as a 
      critical part of conducting the mySupport study. The findings from this study 
      informed the development of a PPI strategy and an international Strategic Guiding 
      Council that included family carers of those living with advanced dementia in LTC 
      homes in six countries. This manuscript focused on the perspectives of 
      researchers on their engagement with people with lived experiences of dementia 
      and EOL. The perspectives of persons with lived experiences on engaging in the 
      mySupport research study will be reported in a forthcoming manuscript.

TI  - Patient partner perspectives on compensation: Insights from the Canadian Patient 
      Partner Survey.
PG  - e13971

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a growing role for patients, family members and caregivers 
      as consultants, collaborators and partners in health system settings in Canada. 
      However, compensation for this role is not systematized. When offered, it varies 
      in both type (e.g., one-time honorarium, salary) and amount. Further, broad-based 
      views of patient partners on compensation are still unknown. We aimed to describe 
      the types and frequency of compensation patient partners have been offered and 
      their attitudes towards compensation. METHODS: This study uses data from the 
      Canadian Patient Partner Study (CPPS) survey. The survey gathered the experiences 
      and perspectives of those who self-identified as patient partners working across 
      the Canadian health system. Three questions were about compensation, asking what 
      types of compensation participants had been offered, if they had ever refused 
      compensation, and whether they felt adequately compensated. The latter two 
      questions included open-text comments in addition to menu-based and scaled 
      response options. Basic frequencies were performed for all questions and 
      open-text comments were analyzed through inductive qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: A total of 603 individuals participated in the CPPS survey. Most 
      respondents were never or rarely offered salary (81%), honorarium (64%), gift 
      cards (80%) or material gifts (93%) while half were offered conference 
      registration and expenses at least sometimes. A total of 129 (26%) of 499 
      respondents reported refusing compensation. Of 511 respondents, half felt 
      adequately compensated always or often, and half only sometimes, rarely or never. 
      Open-text comments revealed positive, ambivalent and negative attitudes towards 
      compensation. Attitudes were framed by perceptions about their role, sentiments 
      of giving back to the health system, feelings of acknowledgement, practical 
      considerations, values of fairness and equity and accountability relationships. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that compensation is not standardized in 
      Canada. Half of survey respondents routinely feel inadequately compensated. 
      Patient partners have diverse views of what constitutes adequate compensation 
      inclusive of personal considerations such as a preference for volunteering, and 
      broader concerns such as promoting equity in patient partnership. Organizations 
      should attempt to ensure that compensation practices are clear, transparent and 
      attentive to patient partners' unique contexts. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Two patient 
      partners are members of the CPPS research team and have been fully engaged in all 
      study phases from project conception to knowledge translation. They are 
      co-authors of this manuscript. The survey was co-designed and pilot tested with 
      patient partners and survey participants were patient partners.

TI  - Student mental health outcomes of a clustered SMART for developing an adaptive 
      implementation strategy to support school-based CBT delivery.

AB  - PURPOSE: Most youth experiencing anxiety/depression lack access to evidence-based 
      mental health practices (EBPs). School-delivered care improves access, and 
      various support can help school professionals (SPs; school social workers, 
      counselors) deliver EBPs, like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT). Understanding 
      implementation strategies' impact on downstream mental health outcomes is crucial 
      to scaling up EBPs to address the treatment gap, but it has rarely been assessed. 
      METHODS: This paper compares implementation strategies' impact on change in 
      student outcomes, collected as exploratory outcomes from a type III hybrid 
      implementation-effectiveness trial. A clustered, sequential, multiple-assignment 
      randomized trial design was used, which embedded four implementation supports 
      that differentially sequence three implementation strategies, Replicating 
      Effective Programs (REP), Coaching, and Facilitation. Prior to the first 
      randomization, N = 169 SPs from 94 Michigan high schools each identified up to 10 
      students whom they believed could benefit from CBT and facilitated student survey 
      completion. Changes in students' depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9, 
      modified for teens) and anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) over 
      10 months were compared across the four sequences of implementation support using 
      a generalization of a marginal, weighted least squares approach developed for a 
      clustered SMARTs. RESULTS: Small, non-clinically significant reductions in 
      symptoms over the study period were found. Pairwise comparisons found no 
      significant differences in symptom change across the four implementation 
      strategies. The difference in the estimated mean PHQ-9T/GAD-7 scores between the 
      least and the most intensive strategies (REP vs. REP+Coaching+Facilitation) was 
      1.04 (95%CI = -0.95, 3.04) for depression and 0.82 (95%CI = -0.89, 2.52) for 
      anxiety. DISCUSSION: No difference in symptom change was found across the four 
      implementation strategies. Multiple forms of implementation support may be useful 
      for improving student mental health outcomes. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - The Cortisol Awakening Response: Regulation and Functional Significance.
PG  - 43-59
LID - 10.1210/endrev/bnae024 [doi]
AB  - In healthy individuals, the majority of cortisol secretion occurs within several 
      hours surrounding morning awakening. A highly studied component of this secretory 
      period is the cortisol awakening response (CAR), the rapid increase in cortisol 
      levels across the first 30 to 45 minutes after morning awakening. This strong 
      cortisol burst at the start of the active phase has been proposed to be 
      functional in preparing the organism for the challenges of the upcoming day. 
      Here, we review evidence on key regulatory and functional processes of the CAR 
      and develop an integrative model of its functional role. Specifically, we propose 
      that, in healthy individuals, the CAR is closely regulated by an intricate 
      dual-control system, which draws upon key circadian, environmental, and 
      neurocognitive processes to best predict the daily need for cortisol-related 
      action. Fine-tuned CAR expression, in turn, is then assumed to induce potent 
      glucocorticoid action via rapid nongenomic and slower genomic pathways (eg, 
      affecting circadian clock gene expression) to support and modulate daily activity 
      through relevant metabolic, immunological, and neurocognitive systems. We propose 
      that this concerted action is adaptive in mediating two main functions: a primary 
      process to mobilize resources to meet activity-related demands and a secondary 
      process to help the organism counterregulate adverse prior-day emotional 
      experiences.

      and Scoping Review.
PG  - e70008

LID - e70008
AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the world's population ages, there has been increasing attention 
      to developing health policies to support older adults. Engaging older adults in 
      policy-making is one way to ensure that policy decisions align with their needs 
      and priorities. However, ageist stereotypes often underestimate older adults' 
      ability to participate in such initiatives. This scoping review aims to describe 
      the characteristics and impacts of public engagement initiatives designed to help 
      inform health policy-making for older adults. METHODS: A systematic search of 
      peer-reviewed and grey literature (English only) describing public engagement 
      initiatives in health policy-making for older adults was conducted using six 
      electronic databases, Google and the Participedia website. No geographical, 
      methodological or time restrictions were applied to the search. Eligibility 
      criteria were purposefully broad to capture a wide array of relevant engagement 
      initiatives. The outcomes of interest included participants, engagement methods 
      and reported impacts. RESULTS: This review included 38 papers. The majority of 
      public engagement initiatives were funded or initiated by governments or 
      government agencies as a formal activity to address policy issues, compared to 
      initiatives without a clear link to a specific policy-making process (e.g., 
      research projects). While most initiatives engaged older adults as target 
      participants, there was limited reporting on efforts to achieve participant 
      diversity. Consultation-type engagement activities were most prevalent, compared 
      to deliberative and collaborative approaches. Impacts of public engagement were 
      frequently reported without formal evaluations. Notably, a few articles reported 
      negative impacts of such initiatives. CONCLUSION: This review describes how 
      public engagement practices have been conducted to help inform health 
      policy-making for older adults and the documented impacts. The findings can 
      assist policymakers, government staff, researchers and seniors' advocates in 
      supporting the design and execution of public engagement initiatives in this 
      policy sector. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Older adult partners from the 
      McMaster University Collaborative for Health and Aging provided strategic advice 
      throughout the key phases of this review, including developing a review protocol, 
      data charting and synthesis and interpreting and presenting the review findings. 
      This collaborative partnership was an essential aspect of this review, enhancing 
      its relevance and meaningfulness for older adults.

AB  - The Washington State Department of Health developed an equitable funding 
      allocation methodology incorporating quantitative and qualitative decision-making 
      components. We describe the methodology and an implementation evaluation 
      performed by an external evaluation team using the RE-AIM (Reach, Effectiveness, 
      Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance) evaluation framework. The evaluation 
      team concluded that the methodology was developed in a way that used a racial 
      equity lens and prioritized intersectionalities in the communities that the 
      funding was intended to serve. (Am J Public Health. 2024;114(S7):S575-S579.

TI  - Journey through the Decades: The Evolution in Treatment and Shared Decision 
      Making for Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/cancers16162807 [doi]
LID - 2807
AB  - The management of locally advanced rectal cancer has undergone significant 
      transformations over the decades and optimal treatment approaches continue to 
      evolve. There have been numerous advances in surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation 
      therapy from the first description of the abdominoperineal resection in 1908, 
      timing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy in the late 20th and early 21st 
      century, and most recently, the introduction of organ preservation or 
      nonoperative management in 2004. Alongside these advancements, the concept of 
      shared decision making in medicine has evolved, prompting a focus on 
      patient-centered care. This evolution in practice has been fueled by a growing 
      recognition of the importance of patient autonomy and the alignment of treatment 
      options with patients' values and preferences. With the growing number of 
      possible treatment options, variability in patient counseling exists, 
      highlighting the need for a standardized approach to shared decision making in 
      locally advanced rectal cancer. This narrative review will describe the evolution 
      of treatment options of locally advanced rectal cancer as well as the concept of 
      shared decision making and decision aids, and will introduce a decision aid for 
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who have achieved a complete 
      clinical response and are eligible for watch and wait.

AB  - Trauma leads to mental health problems including posttraumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. New treatments are needed for traumatic stress 
      that can overcome barriers to care while targeting underlying biological 
      mechanisms of the pathology. Morning light treatment has potential as a novel 
      intervention for traumatic stress. We conducted a randomized clinical trial 
      testing 3 doses of a 4-week morning light treatment in people with traumatic 
      stress to evaluate brain mechanisms underlying the treatment. Forty-six 
      participants completed a baseline week followed by a 4-week morning light 
      treatment (15, 30 or 60 mins each morning). Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      was conducted at pre- and post-treatment using an emotional faces task to probe 
      the amygdala, based on prior work showing direct effects of light on the amygdala 
      and the role of amygdala in traumatic stress. Clinician-rated symptoms and 
      self-reported symptoms were also assessed at pre- and post-treatment. No group 
      differences were observed in left amygdala reactivity, but right amygdala 
      reactivity reduced only in the 30 and 60 min groups with medium effect sizes. 
      Clinical symptoms reduced in all groups with medium to large effect sizes. 
      Self-reported depression and anxiety scores reduced more in the 60 min than in 
      the 15 min group (p = .02). The results suggest that 4 weeks of morning light 
      treatment of at least 30 min per day can reduce amygdala reactivity and symptoms 
      of traumatic stress. Morning light treatment should be further explored as a 
      potential treatment for traumatic stress, given it is relatively safe, 
      acceptable, accessible and scalable.

AB  - Anorectal abscesses are a common colorectal emergency. The hallmark of treatment 
      is obtaining source control while avoiding injury to the underlying sphincter 
      complex. Understanding the anatomy of an anorectal abscess is critical to 
      planning the appropriate drainage strategy and decreasing the risk of complex 
      fistula formation. Use of antibiotics should be reserved for those with extensive 
      cellulitis, signs of systemic infection, or patients who are immunocompromised. 
      Whether antibiotics prevent future fistula formation is an area of active 
      research. Primary fistulotomy at time of the index drainage is controversial; 
      however, there may be situations where it is appropriate. It is important to 
      counsel patients that after effective drainage of an anorectal abscess, they have 
      a 30 to 50% chance of developing an anal fistula that will then require further 
      treatment.

TI  - Public perspectives on the benefits and harms of lung cancer screening: A 
      systematic review and mixed-method integrative synthesis.

AB  - ObjectiveScreening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography aims to 
      reduce lung cancer mortality, but there is a lack of knowledge about how target 
      populations consider its potential benefits and harms.MethodsWe conducted a 
      systematic review of primary empirical studies published in any jurisdiction 
      since 2002 using an integrative meta-synthesis technique. We searched six health 
      and social science databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles, 
      abstracts, and potentially eligible full-text studies. Quantitative assessments 
      and open-ended perspectives on benefits and harms were extracted and convergently 
      integrated at analysis using a narrative approach. Study quality was 
      assessed.ResultsThe review included 26 quantitative, 18 qualitative, and 5 mixed 
      methods studies. Study quality was acceptable. Lung cancer screening was widely 
      perceived to be personally beneficial for early detection and reassurance. 
      Radiation exposure and screening accuracy were recognised as harms, but these 
      were frequently considered to be justified by early detection of lung cancer. 
      Stigma, anxiety, and fear related to screening procedures and results were 
      pervasive among current smokers. People with low incomes reported not 
      participating in screening because of potential out-of-pocket costs and 
      geographic access.ConclusionsPopulations targeted for lung cancer screening 
      tended to consider screening as personally beneficial and rationalised physical, 
      but not psychological, harms. Screening programmes should be clear about 
      benefits, use non-stigmatising design, and consider equity as a guiding 
      principle.

AB  - Canada has a rich history of public engagement in the health policy sector. 
      However, current political, economic and social challenges call for critical 
      reflection on this history, to assess whether current approaches to engaging 
      Canadian publics are up to the task, and what adaptations or new approaches might 
      be needed. If the persisting inequities in health systems across Canada are going 
      to be addressed, it is imperative that those designing, developing and 
      implementing policies find ways to reflect the needs and preferences of the 
      communities and populations most adversely affected by these inequities in their 
      decisions. The purpose of this special issue is to address this important topic 
      through a series of research papers and commentaries. Our work is targeted to 
      health policy makers across Canada who are seeking to engage with various publics 
      on a wide array of health policy issues. We offer key insights into what more 
      purposeful and equitable public engagement might look like, as well as common 
      pitfalls in public engagement practices and how they can be avoided.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Canada has a rich history of public engagement in health policy; 
      however, shifts in engagement practices over time have not been critically 
      examined. METHODOLOGY: We searched for cases of government-initiated public 
      engagement in Canadian health policy from 2000 to 2021 at the federal, provincial 
      (Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia) and pan-Canadian levels. Government 
      databases, portals and platforms for engagement were searched, followed by 
      academic and grey literature using relevant search terms. A coding scheme was 
      iteratively developed to categorize cases by target population, recruitment 
      method and type of engagement. RESULTS: We identified 132 cases of 
      government-initiated public engagement. We found a predominance of feedback and 
      consultation engagement types and self-selection recruitment, especially at the 
      federal level from 2016 onward. Engagements that targeted multiple populations 
      (patients, public and other stakeholders) were favoured overall and over time. 
      Just over 10% of cases in our survey mentioned efforts to engage with 
      equity-deserving groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results identify a heavy 
      reliance over time on more passive, indirect engagement approaches, which limit 
      opportunities for collaborative problem solving and fail to include 
      equity-deserving populations. Those overseeing the design and implementation of 
      government-initiated public engagement will draw valuable lessons from this 
      review to inform the design of engagement initatives.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public engagement in long-term care policy making in Canada has 
      primarily focused on "intermediary agents" who speak on behalf of long-term care 
      (LTC) residents and their family caregivers. Yet the legitimacy of these 
      intermediaries, as perceived by those they represent, has gone largely 
      unexplored. This study examines LTC resident and family perspectives on who can 
      legitimately represent them in LTC policy making. METHODOLOGY: We used an 
      interpretive description design, drawing on semi-structured interviews with LTC 
      residents and family caregivers in Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed using 
      inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen interviews were conducted with 19 
      participants. Three key characteristics of legitimate representatives were 
      identified: (1) willingness to act in the best interests of residents and 
      families, (2) having the necessary skills and capacity to participate in LTC 
      policy making and (3) engaging directly with residents and families. CONCLUSION: 
      Governments and civil society organizations seeking to establish and maintain 
      legitimacy in the eyes of LTC residents and family members can pursue this goal 
      by supporting intermediaries who mirror the identities or experiences of those 
      they represent, who are dedicated to serving their interests and who routinely 
      and directly engage with them to understand the realities of LTC.

AB  - Almost 50,000 people in Canada have had a medically assisted death since federal 
      legislation was passed in 2016. Still, the debate about the permissibility of 
      medical assistance in dying (MAiD) continues to rage. The central role of shared 
      values and ethics in public policy making emphasizes the importance of engaging 
      the public, particularly around heavily value-laden issues such as MAiD. Public 
      deliberation, a mode of engagement that fosters sustained and reasoned discussion 
      between participants, is well-suited to addressing such ethically contentious 
      policy issues. In this paper, we review recent efforts to engage the public on 
      assisted dying within and outside Canada and explain how public deliberation 
      could contribute substantively to MAiD policy making.

TI  - Building Engagement-Capable Environments for Health System Transformation: 
      Development and Early Implementation of a Capability Framework for Patient, 
      Family and Caregiver Engagement in Ontario Health Teams.
PG  - e70083
LID - 10.1111/hex.70083 [doi]

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread calls to involve patients, families and 
      caregivers (PFCs) as partners at all levels of health system planning and design, 
      there is unevenness in how engagement efforts are supported across these 
      settings. The concept of 'engagement-capable environments' offers a way forward 
      to uncover the key requirements for sustainable, high-quality engagement, but 
      more work is needed to identify the specific competencies required to create 
      these environments. We addressed this gap by developing a capability framework 
      for Ontario Health Teams (OHTs), a newly established structure for planning, 
      designing, organizing and delivering care in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: The 
      framework was co-developed by a Working Group of OHT staff and leaders, PFC 
      partners, researchers and government personnel. Project activities occurred over 
      four phases: (1) planning, (2) evidence review and surveying of intended users to 
      identify key competencies, (3) framework design and (4) implementation. RESULTS: 
      An evidence review identified more than 90 potential competencies for this work. 
      These results were contextualized and expanded through a survey of OHT 
      stakeholders to brainstorm potential competencies, supports and enablers for 
      engagement. Surveys were completed by 69 individuals; 689 knowledge and skill 
      competency statements, 462 attitude and behaviour competency statements and 250 
      supports and enablers were brainstormed. The statements were analysed and 
      organized into initial competency categories, which were reviewed, discussed and 
      iteratively refined by Working Group members and through broader consultations 
      with the OHT community. The final framework includes six competency domains and 
      four support and enabler domains, each with sub-domain elements, mapped across a 
      three-stage maturity model. The framework has been disseminated across OHTs, and 
      its adoption and implementation are now requirements within OHT agreements. 
      CONCLUSION: The framework combines a strong conceptual foundation with actionable 
      elements informed by the literature and consultations with the intended users of 
      the framework. Although developed for OHTs, the framework should be broadly 
      applicable to other health system organizations seeking similar health system 
      transformation goals. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver

AB  - Schools are a promising access point for youth with mental health concerns, but 
      school-based mental health professionals (SPs) often need ongoing support to 
      provide high-fidelity cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Adherence and 
      competence, two critical elements of fidelity, were examined in a 
      cluster-randomized implementation trial. We evaluated CBT adherence and then 
      triangulated CBT adherence with end-of-study competence. We then evaluated the 
      effects of two implementation supports, Coaching and (for slower-responding 
      schools) Facilitation, on adherence and competence. By the end of the 43-week 
      study period, 27.8% of SPs met adherence criteria. Adherent SPs scored higher on 
      the competence measure, the CBT Competence Scale (t (116.2) = 3.71, p < .001). No 
      significant difference in adherence was found among SPs at schools assigned to 
      Coaching vs. not (Delta = 6.0%, p = .385), however SPs at schools randomized to 
      Coaching scored significantly higher on two of the four competence subscales 
      (Non-Behavioral and Behavioral skills). Among slower-responder schools, SPs at 
      schools assigned to Facilitation were more likely to demonstrate adherence (Delta = 
      16.3%, p = .022), but there was no effect of Facilitation on competence. 
      Approximately one quarter of SPs met adherence criteria in the trial; adequate 
      delivery of exposure was a primary obstacle to reaching adherence. Facilitation 
      may be especially suited to help SPs overcome barriers to delivery, whereas 
      Coaching may be especially suited to help SPs improve CBT competence. Both are 
      likely needed to build a mental health work force with the competence and ability 
      to deliver EBPs in schools.

TI  - Long-term Follow-up After an Initial Episode of Diverticulitis: A 13-Year Update.
PG  - 234-241
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000003587 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with recurrent diverticulitis, the trigger to proceed to 
      elective sigmoid colectomy is unclear. Current clinical practice guidelines 
      suggest that this is an individualized decision between surgeon and patient. 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term risk of diverticulitis recurrence and 
      determine predictors of recurrent disease. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. 
      SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with CT-proven 
      diverticulitis who presented as inpatient or outpatient between 2002 and 2008. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Incidence of diverticulitis recurrence was determined via medical 
      record review and questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Risk of recurrent 
      diverticulitis or surgery for diverticulitis. RESULTS: A total of 753 patients 
      with first-time diverticulitis were identified. The patients had a mean age of 
      61.5 years (SD 15.3). The median follow-up was 13.2 years (interquartile range, 
      3.8-18.3). There were 486 patients (64.5%) alive at the time of follow-up. During 
      the initial presentation, 29 patients (3.9%) required Interventional Radiology 
      drainage and 37 (4.9%) required emergency surgery. Forty-three patients (5.7%) 
      underwent elective surgery after the initial presentation and 77 (10.2%) 
      underwent surgery after more than 1 episode. Of those who did not undergo surgery 
      for the first episode, 353 (52.4%) experienced recurrent disease with a median 
      time to recurrence of 2.9 years (interquartile range, 0.83-8.5 years). On 
      multivariate analysis, female sex (HR 1.28, p = 0.04), sigmoid disease (HR 1.35, 
      p = 0.03), smoldering disease (HR 3.17, p < 0.01), length of involved segment 
      >5 cm (HR 1.28, p = 0.04), and maximum fat stranding diameter >1.8 cm (HR 1.29, p 
      = 0.03) were associated with disease recurrence. Kaplan-Meier estimates of 
      freedom from recurrence were 73.1% (69.6%-76.3%) at 1 year, 47.9% (44.0%-51.6%) 
      at 5 years, and 34.6% (31.0%-38.2%) at 10 years after initial presentation. 
      LIMITATIONS: Retrospective design. CONCLUSIONS: After a single episode of 
      diverticulitis, the incidence of recurrence is more than 50% on long-term 
      follow-up. Variables such as female sex, sigmoid disease, smoldering disease, 
      length of involved segment >5 cm, and maximum fat stranding diameter >1.8 cm were 
      associated with an increased risk of recurrence. These findings should be 
      considered when counseling patients on the decision to proceed with elective 
      colectomy. See Video Abstract . SEGUIMIENTO A LARGO PLAZO TRAS UN EPISODIO 
      INICIAL DE DIVERTICULITIS UNA ACTUALIZACIN DE AOS: ANTECEDENTES:En el caso de los 
      pacientes con diverticulitis recurrente, no esta claro el factor desencadenante 
      para proceder a una colectomia sigmoidea electiva. Las guias de practica clinica 
      actuales sugieren que se trata de una decision individualizada entre el cirujano 
      y el paciente.OBJETIVO:Evaluar el riesgo a largo plazo de recurrencia de la 
      diverticulitis y determinar los predictores de la enfermedad 
      recurrente.DISENO:Serie de casos retrospectiva.ESCENARIO:Centro de atencion 
      terciaria.PACIENTES:Pacientes consecutivos con diverticulitis comprobada por TC 
      que se presentaron como pacientes hospitalizados o ambulatorios entre 2002 y 
      2008.INTERVENCIONES:Incidencia de recurrencia de la diverticulitis determinada 
      mediante revision de historias clinicas y cuestionario.MEDIDAS PRINCIPALES DE 
      RESULTADOS:Riesgo de diverticulitis recurrente o cirugia para 
      diverticulitis.RESULTADOS:Se identificaron 753 pacientes con diverticulitis por 
      primera vez. Los pacientes tenian 61,5 anos (DE 15,3). La mediana de seguimiento 
      fue de 13,2 anos (RIC 3,8-18,3). 486 (64,5 %) estaban vivos en el momento del 
      seguimiento. Durante la presentacion inicial, 29 (3,9 %) requirieron drenaje de 
      IR y 37 (4,9 %) requirieron cirugia de emergencia. 43 (5,7 %) se sometieron a 
      cirugia electiva despues de la presentacion inicial y 77 (10,2 %) se sometieron a 
      cirugia despues de mas de 1 episodio. De aquellos sin cirugia para el primer 
      episodio, 353 (52,4 %) experimentaron enfermedad recurrente con un tiempo medio 
      hasta la recurrencia de 2,9 anos (RIC 0,83-8,5 anos). En el analisis 
      multivariable, el sexo femenino (HR 1,28, p = 0,04), la enfermedad sigmoidea (HR 
      1,35, p = 0,03), la enfermedad latente (HR 3,17, p < 0,01), la longitud del 
      segmento afectado > 5 cm (HR 1,28, p = 0,04) y el diametro maximo de la hebra 
      grasa > 1,8 cm (HR 1,29, p = 0,03) se asociaron con la recurrencia de la 
      enfermedad. Las estimaciones de Kaplan Meier de la libertad de recurrencia fueron 
      del 73,1 % (69,6-76,3 %) al ano, del 47,9 % (44,0-51,6 %) a los 5 anos y del 34,6 
      % (31,0-38,2 %) a los 10 anos despues de la presentacion 
      inicial.LIMITACIONES:Diseno retrospectivo.CONCLUSIONES:Despues de un unico 
      episodio de diverticulitis, la incidencia de recurrencia es superior al 50% en el 
      seguimiento a largo plazo. Variables como el sexo femenino, la enfermedad 
      sigmoidea, la enfermedad latente, la longitud del segmento afectado mayor de 5 cm 
      y el diametro maximo de la hebra de grasa mayor de 1,8 cm se asociaron con un 
      mayor riesgo de recurrencia. Estos hallazgos deben tenerse en cuenta al asesorar 
      a los pacientes sobre la decision de proceder con la colectomia electiva.

      Informant Qualitative Description Study.

LID - 10.1093/phe/phae008 [doi]
AB  - Normative issues associated with the design and implementation of 
      population-based lung cancer screening policies are underexamined. This study was 
      an exposition of the ethical justification for screening and potential ethical 
      issues and their solutions in Canadian jurisdictions. A qualitative description 
      study was conducted. Key informants, defined as policymakers, scientists and 
      clinicians who develop and implement lung cancer screening policies in Canada, 
      were purposively sampled and interviewed using a semi-structured guide informed 
      by population-based disease screening principles and ethical issues in cancer 
      screening. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. 
      Fifteen key informants from seven provinces were interviewed. Virtually all 
      justified screening by beneficence, describing that population benefits outweigh 
      individual harms if high-risk people are screened in organized programs according 
      to disease screening principles. Equity of screening access, stigma and lung 
      cancer primary prevention were other ethical issues identified. Key informants 
      prioritized beneficence over concerns for group-level justice issues when making 
      decisions about whether to implement screening policies. This prioritization, 
      though slight, may impede the implementation of screening policies in a way that 
      effectively addresses justice issues, a goal likely to require justice theory and 
      critical interpretation of disease screening principles.

TI  - A Multi-institutional Study From the US Resident Operative Experience Consortium 
      Examining Factors Associated With Exposure and Pursuit of Colorectal Fellowship 
      After General Surgery Residency.
PG  - 637-646
LID - 10.1097/DCR.0000000000003671 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colon and rectal surgery is a popular fellowship after general 
      surgery residency. The impact of a resident's colon and rectal surgery experience 
      during residency may impact their career trajectory and pursuit of colon and 
      rectal surgery. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify individual and program 
      factors associated with matriculation into a colon and rectal surgery fellowship 
      compared to other career trajectories. DESIGN: An analysis of case logs and 
      demographic data from graduates of 19 accredited general surgery residency 
      programs from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education between 
      2010 and 2020 was completed using the US Resident Operative Experience 
      Consortium. The demographics and operative experience of residents who pursued 
      colon and rectal surgery fellowship were compared to those who did not. SETTINGS: 
      This study is a retrospective review of resident specialty selection, demographic 
      information, and operative case logs. PATIENTS: Graduates of 19 accredited 
      general surgery residency programs from the Accreditation Council for Graduate 
      Medical Education between 2010 and 2020 participated in the study. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: Resident demographics, general surgery and colon and rectal surgery 
      program-specific characteristics, and resident operative case logs associated 
      with entrance into colon and rectal surgery fellowship served as the primary 
      outcome measures. RESULTS: Those in the colon and rectal surgery cohort were more 
      likely to be female sex and have completed a dedicated research experience. No 
      association was noted with the colocation of a colon and rectal surgery 
      fellowship and general surgery residency. Multivariable analysis demonstrated a 
      higher likelihood of colon and rectal surgery fellowship matriculation for female 
      sex residents and residents who completed a clinical fourth-year colon and rectal 
      surgery rotation. Higher logged colon and rectal surgery-specific case volume was 
      associated with those matriculating into colon and rectal surgery. LIMITATIONS: 
      Self-reported case log data, differences in residency structures in offering 
      colon and rectal surgery rotations to clinical fourth-year residents, and 
      academic bias of participating residency programs. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      identified individual and program-specific factors associated with matriculating 
      into colon and rectal surgery fellowship, such as female sex, colon and rectal 
      surgery-specific rotation in the fourth clinical year, and higher volume of colon 
      and rectal surgery-specific cases. These data may optimize resident colon and 
      rectal surgery experience and strengthen the colon and rectal surgery fellowship 
      pipeline. See Video Abstract . UN ESTUDIO MULTIINSTITUCIONAL DEL CONSORCIO ROPE 
      DE EE UU QUE EXAMINA LOS FACTORES ASOCIADOS CON LA EXPOSICIN Y LA BSQUEDA DE UNA 
      BECA EN CIRUGA COLORRECTAL DESPUS DE LA RESIDENCIA EN CIRUGA GENERAL: 
      ANTECEDENTES:La cirugia de colon y recto (CRS) es una beca popular despues de la 
      residencia en cirugia general (GS). El impacto de la experiencia de un residente 
      en CRS durante la residencia puede afectar su trayectoria profesional y la 
      busqueda de beca en CRS.OBJETIVO:Este estudio tiene como objetivo identificar los 
      factores individuales y del programa asociados con la matriculacion en la beca de 
      CRS en comparacion con otras trayectorias profesionales.DISENO:Se realizo un 
      analisis de los registros de casos y los datos demograficos de los graduados de 
      19 programas de residencia de GS acreditados por la ACGME entre 2010 y 2020 
      utilizando el Consorcio de Experiencia Operativa de Residentes (ROPE) de EE. UU. 
      Se compararon los datos demograficos y la experiencia operativa de los residentes 
      que buscaron la beca de CRS con los que no lo hicieron.ESTABLECIMIENTOS:Este 
      estudio es una revision retrospectiva de la seleccion de especialidades de los 
      residentes, la informacion demografica y los registros de casos 
      operativos.PARTICIPANTES:Participaron en el estudio graduados de 19 programas de 
      residencia de GS acreditados por la ACGME entre 2010 y 2020.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS 
      DE RESULTADOS:La demografia de los residentes, las caracteristicas generales y 
      especificas del programa relacionadas con CRS y los registros de casos operativos 
      de los residentes asociados con el ingreso a la beca CRS sirvieron como medidas 
      de resultados principales.RESULTADOS:Los miembros de la cohorte CRS tenian mas 
      probabilidades de ser de sexo femenino y haber completado una experiencia de 
      investigacion dedicada. No se observo asociacion con la ubicacion conjunta de una 
      beca CRS y una residencia de GS. El analisis multivariable demostro una mayor 
      probabilidad de matriculacion en la beca CRS para los residentes de sexo femenino 
      y los residentes que completaron una rotacion clinica de CRS de cuarto ano. Un 
      mayor volumen de casos especificos de CRS registrados se asocio con aquellos que 
      se matricularon en CRS.LIMITACIONES:Datos de registros de casos autoinformados, 
      diferencias en las estructuras de residencia al ofrecer rotaciones de CRS a 
      residentes clinicos de cuarto ano, sesgo academico de los programas de residencia 
      participantes.CONCLUSIONES:Este estudio identifico factores individuales y 
      especificos del programa asociados con la matriculacion en la beca CRS, entre 
      ellos el sexo femenino, la rotacion especifica de CRS en el cuarto ano clinico y 
      un mayor volumen de casos especificos de CRS. Estos datos pueden optimizar la 
      experiencia de los residentes en CRS y fortalecer la linea de becas de CRS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is unknown what traits practicing surgeons value in those wishing 
      to become colorectal surgeons. The objective of this study was determine the most 
      common qualities used to describe applicants to colorectal surgery residency. 
      DESIGN: Letters of a recommendation (LOR) qualitatively analyzed to determine how 
      writers described applicants. Letters were analyzed, coded, and categorized to 
      understand the qualities most admired and devalued by reviewers. SETTING: LOR 
      submitted to Lahey Hospital and Medical Center in Massachusetts PARTICIPANTS: 111 
      applicants to colorectal surgery residency at Lahey during the 2019 to 2020 cycle 
      including 658 letters and 409 letter writers. There were 315 standardized LOR and 
      343 narrative LOR. RESULTS: 75% of letters described some aspect of "grindstone" 
      or hard-working attributes as being a positive. Other LORs valued attributes 
      including being likeable and having good clinical and technical skills. The most 
      frequent applicant flaws identified in the LOR included poor leadership skills 
      and lack of delegation skills. Several letter writers also expressed concerns 
      when an applicant was too soft spoken. CONCLUSIONS: This study codifies the 
      qualities valued by letter writers in describing colorectal surgery applicants. 
      The descriptors used by surgeons in LOR can be thought of as a portrayal of the 
      qualities composing an "ideal surgical trainee." This cohort of LOR emphasized 
      grindstone characteristics as a positive and poor leadership as a negative. As 
      work-life integration becomes increasingly important to early career surgeons, 
      intergenerational conflict may arise if the qualities lauded in the "ideal 
      applicant" focus on work at all cost.

TI  - Working Toward Structural Change: Visions and Tension Points for a City-Wide 
      Unarmed Response Program to Enhance Health Equity.
PG  - 15248399251328686
LID - 10.1177/15248399251328686 [doi]
AB  - Amid growing evidence and high-profile incidents highlighting the dangers of 
      current police practices, many are questioning the role of armed police in their 
      communities. Police violence is a public health issue and unarmed nonpolice 
      response programs represent one potential solution for addressing this issue. In 
      this article, we describe local visions and key tension points for an unarmed 
      public safety program to reduce police violence and improve the health and 
      well-being of its residents. We report on interviews (n = 15) conducted with 
      local leaders, activists, and social service providers in a small-sized 
      Midwestern city that had allocated funding to pilot an unarmed response program. 
      To supplement the interviews, we also systematically followed local news stories 
      and city council meetings and participated as members of a coalition working 
      toward implementing an unarmed response program. Our analysis focused on 
      participants' visions and expectations for an unarmed safety program and 
      identified several key concerns related to program logistics, including program 
      reach, response time, funding, impact, and staffing. We found that key concerns 
      raised by activists and leaders-including the scope of the program, the 
      satisfaction the community has with the program, how it will be evaluated, and 
      how community members will be involved-are similar to concerns raised in a 
      typical health promotion program planning process. The visions and tensions 
      detailed in this article can inform organizing efforts in other municipalities 
      and suggest a role for public health practitioners in developing and implementing 
      these programs.

TI  - Change Is Hardest Right Before the Glass Ceiling Breaks: An Update on Women 
      Pursuing Careers in Academic Surgery at a National Level.
PG  - 176-183
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006718 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide a comprehensive update on the 
      representation of women in academic surgery by specialty, measuring progress and 
      opportunity with regard to women "breaking" the glass ceiling at the trainee, 
      faculty, and department chair levels. BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, 
      initiatives have contributed to educational awareness, culture shifts, and a 
      focus on inclusive excellence in surgery, leading to an increase in the number of 
      women surgeons. Despite progress, a persistent gender gap in surgical faculty 
      positions remains, and projections suggest that it will take more than a century 
      to reach parity at the highest levels of academic surgery. METHODS: Data from the 
      Association of American Medical Colleges' FACTS and Faculty Rosters and the 
      American Medical Colleges' Graduate Medical Education reports from 2006 to 2023 
      were analyzed to assess gender representation in surgery. Linear regression 
      analyses were used to describe trends in the proportions of women who were 
      promoted along the professional development pathway (resident to faculty to 
      department chair) from 2006 to 2023. RESULTS: Over our 17-year study period, all 
      included surgical subspecialties increased in the proportion of women trainees, 
      with the largest average annual increases observed in pediatric, plastic, and 
      vascular surgery training programs. Although all surgical faculty levels 
      experienced growth in the proportion of women faculty﻿, the average annual change 
      in the proportion of women decreased as seniority increased. At the observed 
      trend, it is projected that surgical department chairs will not achieve equal 
      proportions of men and women until the year 2102. CONCLUSIONS: Across the board, 
      the proportion of women in surgery has increased. However, there remains 
      opportunity for improvement, particularly at the senior faculty and department 
      chair levels.

TI  - Shared Decision Making in the Treatment of Rectal Cancer.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14072255 [doi]
LID - 2255
AB  - Background/Objectives: The management of locally advanced rectal cancer has 
      evolved significantly, shaped by advances in multimodal neoadjuvant therapy and a 
      growing emphasis on organ preservation through the watch-and-wait approach. These 
      advancements, however, introduce complex treatment decisions that require careful 
      consideration by both patients and clinicians. Methods: This narrative review 
      explores the evolution of the management of locally advanced rectal cancer and 
      the role of shared decision-making in guiding treatment decisions, particularly 
      for patients facing decisions between surgical resection and watch-and-wait. 
      Additionally, it discusses the development of tools to aid in shared-decision 
      making, current challenges in implementing shared decision-making and future 
      directions for improvement patient centered care in locally advanced rectal 
      cancer management. Results: Considerations for decision making include anatomical 
      considerations that influence surgical options, the potential benefits and risks 
      of watch-and-wait versus surgical resection of the rectum, and the impact of 
      treatment on bowel, urinary, and sexual function. Additionally, patients must 
      weigh the long-term implications of their choices on quality of life. 
      Conclusions: Shared decision-making has emerged as a critical component of 
      patient-centered care and ensures that treatment decisions align with patients' 
      values and priorities. Given the preference-sensitive nature of the management of 
      locally advanced rectal cancer, shared decision-making plays an important role in 
      helping patients navigate these decisions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The timing of post-operative discharge following colectomy 
      procedures remains a subject of debate among colorectal surgeons. Prior studies 
      have demonstrated the safety and adoption of early discharge within 24 h after 
      elective colectomy in carefully selected patients. METHODS: This retrospective 
      cohort study utilizing data from the American COllege of Surgeons National 
      Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) from 2012 to 2021. Adult 
      patients undergoing elective partial colectomy with primary anastomosis and 
      documented length of stay were included. Patients were stratified into early (< 
      24) and non early (>/=24 h) discharge groups. Propensity score matching was used to 
      control for baseline demographics and non-modifiable risk factors. Primary 
      outcomes included 30-day readmission rates and adoption trends of early discharge 
      over time. RESULTS: A total of 282,037 patients met inclusion criteria of which 
      6364 (2.3%) were discharged within 24 h. On propensity score matching the early 
      discharge cohort had a statistically significantly lower rate of readmission 
      (5.5% versus 7.3%, P < 0.001). Additionally, the early discharge group had a 
      significantly reduced rate of anastomotic leak (1.0 versus 2.6%), ileus (2.0% 
      versus 7.6%), and rate of reoperation (1.2% versus 4.0%) (P < 0.001). The 
      proportion of early discharge colectomies increased from 0.8% in 2012 to 3.6% in 
      2021 (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In carefully selected patients, early discharge 
      after colectomy with primary anastomosis does not increase the risk of 
      readmission, reoperation, or 30-d complication rates. Furthermore, the increasing 
      trend in utilization of early discharge after colectomy suggests an increasing 
      acceptance of this practice, though it remains a minority of all colectomies 
      performed among institutions participating in ACS-NSQIP.

TI  - Feasibility and acceptability of written exposure therapy group in a virtual 
      outpatient setting.
LID - 10.1002/jts.23175 [doi]
AB  - Written exposure therapy (WET) has emerged as a promising treatment for 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the potential to overcome common 
      barriers to engagement. Several facets of WET lend themselves particularly well 
      for adaptation to a group setting, yet few studies have examined WET in such 
      formats. The objective of the present study was to present preliminary 
      feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome data from a quality improvement 
      project conducted in an outpatient psychiatry clinic that included patients who 
      engaged in a virtual WET group. Participants were 28 adults from six WET group 
      cohorts that occurred between January 2024 and March 2025. Overall attendance was 
      strong (78.2%), with 67.9% of participants completing at least five of the six 
      weekly sessions. Patient satisfaction ratings were high (80.0%), and 86.7% of 
      participants indicated that they would recommend the group to other individuals 
      struggling with trauma symptoms. Acceptability ratings were also largely 
      supportive of the virtual (vs. in-person) and group (vs. individual) formats. 
      There were large effect sizes for pre-post improvement in PTSD symptoms (PCL-5: M 
      = 52.6 vs. 33.0), d = 1.39, and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: M = 14.2 vs. 9.9), d 
      = 0.86, among participants who completed the group. Our study provides 
      preliminary data suggesting the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual WET 
      group delivered in a naturalistic community setting, with strong attendance and 
      high patient satisfaction. There is significant benefit to standardizing a 
      group-based WET protocol and substantiating clinical benefits through a fully 
      powered randomized controlled clinical trial.

TI  - Prediction of generalized anxiety disorder treatment outcomes with 
      neurobehavioral responses to approach-avoidance conflict: a randomized clinical

AB  - Treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) often aim to address 
      maladaptive approach-avoidance behavior patterns. Approach-avoidance conflict 
      (AAC) offers a potential framework for identifying treatment outcome predictors 
      and informing optimization of GAD treatment. The current study examined whether 
      pre-treatment neurobehavioral AAC indices predict symptom improvement in 
      behavioral activation (BA) and exposure therapy (EXP) for GAD. Treatment-seeking 
      adults meeting criteria for GAD completed a randomized clinical trial with 
      pre-treatment blinding, conducted from 2016-2021. Participants were randomized to 
      complete 10 manualized sessions of BA or EXP. Participants completed an AAC task 
      during functional magnetic resonance imaging pre-treatment. Computational 
      parameters of task behavior were derived, and neural activity was assessed during 
      decision-making and positive and negative outcomes of decisions. Outcome measures 
      were GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms. Of 121 participants recruited, 56 (29 
      BA, 27 EXP; mean age 33.0 years; 12.5% male) treatment completers were included 
      in analyses. Greater AAC task avoidance (d = -0.28) and greater left dorsolateral 
      prefrontal cortex activation during negative outcomes (d = -0.32), predicted 
      greater symptom reduction across treatments. Blunted left amygdala activation to 
      positive outcomes was associated at a trend level with favorable symptom 
      reduction for BA but not EXP (d = -0.20). The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may 
      be a target for enhancing behavior therapy outcomes generally, while left 
      amygdala activation to positive affect may be a target for enhancing outcomes for 
      BA. These findings may inform the optimization of behavioral therapies for GAD 
      and hold potential for transdiagnostic applications, warranting larger, 
      longitudinal studies in clinical settings. Clinical Trials Registration: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02807480.

AB  - Anxiety and impulsivity often co-occur, but due to broad conceptualizations of 
      impulsive behavior, it remains unclear whether anxiety could be positively 
      associated with global impulsivity or specific facets of impulsivity. Negative 
      urgency, or rash behavior that specifically occurs during negative emotional 
      states, may provide common ground to examine the overlap between high anxiety and 
      high impulsivity. Limited work has examined relationships between negative 
      urgency and behavioral processes that are often associated with both anxiety and 
      global impulsivity, such as experiential avoidance. In this study, we examined 
      self-report data collected from a non-clinical sample of adult participants 
      (n = 589) to test relationships between anxiety and experiential avoidance 
      through both negative urgency and global impulsivity. Contrary to hypotheses, we 
      found that negative urgency alone did not alter the relationship between anxiety 
      and experiential avoidance. However, follow-up analyses including data-driven 
      factors of impulsivity revealed that in combination, anxiety and both 
      emotion-based impulsivity (i.e. negative and positive urgency) and hyperactivity 
      were linked to greater experiential avoidance. By contrast, anxiety and 
      non-planning were associated with lower experiential avoidance. These results 
      provide targets for future studies to examine individual differences in profiles 
      of co-occurring anxiety and impulsivity.

TI  - Engaging patient partners to identify research priorities for atrial 
      fibrillation: Results from a patient engagement day.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe a Patient Engagement Day from the Canadian Stroke 
      Prevention Network (C-SPIN). Patients and family members were engaged as patient 
      partners to generate and prioritize future direction for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) 
      research. METHODS: A facilitated group discussion methodology was used that 
      included a nominal group brainstorming and decision-making technique designed to 
      foster participation and idea generation. RESULTS: Twenty-four patient partners 
      attended. Priorities related to: 1) need for a curative focus and not new 
      medication (84 %), 2) identification of triggers (53 %), and 3) home-based/remote 
      monitoring (53 %). Use of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool 
      (PPEET) found patient partners understood the intent of the day, with its 
      objectives being met. Findings highlighted knowledge gaps by patient partners 
      that were previously thought to be understood. CONCLUSION: Patient partners could 
      benefit from more focused education about atrial fibrillation. Notably, the 
      priorities identified by patient partners were new to the research team, 
      reinforcing the importance of engaging with the population who will be impacted 
      by the research. INNOVATION: Little research has been undertaken examining 
      patient partner priorities regarding atrial fibrillation research. This work 
      highlights patient partners' interest in providing input and shaping future 
      research endeavors.

TI  - Characterizing the General Surgery Experience of Future Breast Surgeons: A 
      Multi-institutional Study from the US ROPE Consortium.
LID - 10.1245/s10434-025-17853-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer care has become increasingly complex, lending itself to 
      fellowship-based specialization. However, breast surgery expertise remains 
      central to general surgery training. We hypothesized that residents entering 
      breast surgical oncology (BSO) fellowship have more exposure to breast surgery 
      and log a higher number of breast cases compared with all other graduating 
      residents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographics, program characteristics, and 
      Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) case logs were 
      collected for graduates from 20 general surgery residency programs in the US 
      Resident OPerative Experience (ROPE) Consortium from 2010 to 2020. BSO fellowship 
      matriculants (BSO group) were compared to those entering other surgical 
      fellowships or general surgery practice (non-BSO group). RESULTS: Among 1343 
      graduates, 45 (3.4%) matriculated into BSO fellowship. BSO matriculants were more 
      often female (89% versus 34%, p < 0.0001). Demographic, program, and 
      institutional variables were otherwise similar (all p > 0.05). The BSO group 
      logged fewer total procedures (median, 976 versus 1039), consistent across 
      Surgeon Junior and Teaching Assistant roles and multiple operative domains, 
      including alimentary tract, pediatric, plastics, thoracic, trauma, and vascular 
      (all p < 0.05). However, BSO group logged more breast cases (74 versus 50, 
      p < 0.0001), despite comparable access to a breast surgery rotation (64% versus 
      64%) and fellowship-trained faculty (82% versus 84%; both p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Future BSO matriculants performed 50% more breast cases during residency but 
      logged fewer total cases across multiple operative domains. These residents may 
      develop early interest in breast surgery and subsequently tailor their training. 
      Further mixed-methods studies are needed to understand these findings and their 
      implications for trainees pursuing breast surgery.
