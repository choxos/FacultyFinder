TI  - Do health service organizations and community health centres have higher disease 
      prevention and health promotion levels than fee-for-service practices?
PG  - 575-81
AB  - We interviewed health care providers representing 23 fee-for-service (FFS) 
      practices, 19 health service organizations (HSOs) and 11 community health centres 
      (CHCs) in Ontario to compare self-reported approaches to disease prevention and 
      health promotion. Few significant differences were found across practice types in 
      the presence of recall systems for screening or in knowledge of, compliance with 
      or estimated coverage for selected preventive maneuvers recommended by the 
      Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. CHCs reported a 
      significantly greater variety of formal health promotion programs and a greater 
      tendency to use nonphysician health care personnel to carry out both prevention 
      and health promotion activities. The results must be interpreted with caution 
      because of the use of self-reported data, the low response rate for FFS practices 
      and the use of a restrictive definition of disease prevention tied to evidence 
      from the reports of the task force. Thus, the results cast some doubt on the 
      common assumption that increasing the population served by alternative modes of 
      delivery such as HSOs and CHCs necessarily increases the level of disease 
      prevention and health promotion activity.

TI  - Is reasonable access what we want? Implications of, and challenges to, current 
      Canadian policy on equity in health care.
PG  - 629-53
AB  - Considerations of equity in the context of health care systems are often related 
      closely to the presence or level of prices incurred by users of health care 
      services. Some politicians and commentators have suggested that the removal of 
      user charges under the Canadian health care system has led to equal access to 
      care. But it is not clear that the equity principle inferred from these claims 
      corresponds to the equity goals of current Canadian health policy. In this 
      article the authors identify the precise equity principle that lies behind 
      current health policy in Canada and consider the extent to which that principle 
      is reflected in the performance of the system. They then consider other 
      approaches to equity in health care in the context of the stated objectives of 
      Canadian health policy and identify the implications of pursuing reasonable 
      access in future health policy. The authors suggest that the implications of the 
      current equity goals have not been recognized by policy makers, and if they were 
      to be recognized it is not clear that they would be acceptable to Canadian 
      populations and/or policy makers. Moreover, some of the implications would appear 
      to be incompatible with other stated objectives of public policy.

TI  - HIV testing practices of primary care physicians: an Ontario survey.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - To determine whether physicians are knowledgeable about the risk factors 
      associated with HIV and whether perceived testing practices coincide with testing 
      guidelines, 1,236 physicians were surveyed about which patients they would 
      recommend for HIV testing. A total of 480 usable responses were obtained 
      (response rate of 50% of the eligible sample). Most would suggest testing to 
      partners of intravenous drug users, patients who received blood transfusions 
      between 1978 and 1985, homosexuals and bisexuals, and patients with more than two 
      sexually transmitted diseases. Only 46.4% would suggest testing to patients with 
      more than two sexual partners, and 65.8% would test anyone who asks. Other 
      patients to whom physicians would recommend testing were listed by 16.2%. 
      Logistic regression (F-step) was used to examine the relationship between 
      physician characteristics and likelihood of recommending testing. As a rule, 
      physicians are knowledgeable about the major risk factors and would recommend 
      testing according to guidelines. However, there may be a difference between 
      questionnaire responses and actual practice.

TI  - Preventive care and barriers to effective prevention. How do family physicians 
      see it?
PG  - 1693-700
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess how adequately family physicians think they are delivering 
      preventive care and to examine barriers to providing preventive care. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Primary care medical practices in south-central 
      Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty family physicians and general 
      practitioners who graduated from medical school between 1972 and 1988. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfactory preventive care delivery versus self-assessed 
      coverage of patients for 15 preventive maneuvers. Perceived reasons for lack of 
      success in providing recommended preventive care. RESULTS: For 10 of the 15 
      maneuvers, the proportion of physicians who regarded 90% or higher as 
      satisfactory coverage was twice as great as the proportion who thought they 
      provided that level of coverage. For 11 of the 15 maneuvers, most respondents 
      reported coverage lower than the level they regarded as satisfactory. For six 
      maneuvers, more than two thirds thought they provided less than satisfactory 
      coverage. More than two thirds of respondents suggested these barriers to 
      providing recommended preventive care: patient is healthy and does not visit; 
      patient refuses, is not interested, or does not comply; no effective systems to 
      remind patients to come in for preventive care; and priority given to presenting 
      problem. CONCLUSION: Many family physicians and general practitioners in 
      south-central Ontario provide preventive care to their patients at lower levels 
      than they consider satisfactory. They identified barriers to providing preventive 
      services successfully; these barriers suggest approaches for improving care.

TI  - Do female primary care physicians practise preventive care differently from their 
      male colleagues?
PG  - 2370-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether female primary care physicians' reported coverage of 
      patients eligible for certain preventive care strategies differs from male 
      physicians' reported coverage. DESIGN: A mailed survey. SETTING: Primary care 
      practices in southern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All primary care physicians who 
      graduated between 1972 and 1988 and practised in a defined geographic area of 
      Ontario were selected from the Canadian Medical Association's physician resource 
      database. Response rate was 50%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Answers to questions on 
      sociodemographic and practice characteristics, attitudes toward preventive care, 
      and perceptions about preventive care behaviour and practices. RESULTS: In 
      general, reported coverage for Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health 
      Examination's (CTFPHE) A and B class recommendations was low. However, more 
      female than male physicians reported high coverage of women patients for 
      female-specific preventive care measures (i.e., Pap smears, breast examinations, 
      and mammography) and for blood pressure measurement. Female physicians appeared 
      to question more patients about a greater number of health risks. Often, sex of 
      physician was the most salient factor affecting whether preventive care services 
      thought effective by the CTFPHE were offered. However, when evidence for 
      effectiveness of preventive services was equivocal or lacking, male and female 
      physicians reported similar levels of coverage. CONCLUSION: Female primary care 
      physicians are more likely than their male colleagues to report that their 
      patients eligible for preventive health measures as recommended by the CTFPHE 
      take advantage of these measures.

TI  - Provision of preventive care to unannounced standardized patients.
PG  - 185-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between physician, training and practice 
      characteristics and the provision of preventive care as described in the 
      guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open to new patients within 1 
      hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 125 family physicians 
      were randomly selected from respondents to an earlier preventive care survey. Of 
      the 125, 44 (35.2%) declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) 
      initially consented but later withdrew when they closed their practices to new 
      patients. Sixty-two physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: 
      Unannounced standardized patients posing as new patients to the practice visited 
      study physicians' practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 
      scenarios: 48-year-old man, 70-year-old man, 28-year-old woman and 52-year-old 
      woman. OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of preventive care manoeuvres carrying grade 
      A, B, C, D and E recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic 
      Health Examination that were performed, offered or advised. A standard score was 
      computed based on the performance of grade A and B manoeuvres (good or fair 
      evidence for inclusion in the periodic health examination) and the 
      non-performance of grade D and E manoeuvres (fair or good evidence for exclusion 
      from the periodic health examination). RESULTS: Study physicians performed or 
      offered 65.6% of applicable grade A manoeuvres, 31.0% of grade B manoeuvres, 
      22.4% of grade C manoeuvres, 21.8% of grade D manoeuvres and 4.9% of grade E 
      manoeuvres. The provision of evidence-based preventive care was associated with 
      solo (v. group) practice and capitation or salary (v. fee-for-service) payment 
      method. Preventive care performance was unrelated to physician's sex, 
      certification in family medicine or problem-based (v. traditional) medical school 
      curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive care guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on 
      the Periodic Health Examination have been incompletely integrated into clinical 
      practice. Research is needed to identify and reduce barriers to the provision of 
      preventive care and to develop and apply effective processes for the creation, 
      dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines.

      exploratory study using standardized patients.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of variation in physicians' charges for health 
      care encounters with unannounced standardized patients and factors associated 
      with the variation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open 
      to new patients within 1 hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      stratified random sample of 125 physicians who had responded to an earlier survey 
      regarding preventive care were invited to participate. Of the 125, 44 (35.2%) 
      declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) initially consented but 
      later withdrew because they closed their practices to new patients. Sixty-two 
      physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: Unannounced standardized 
      patients posing as new patients to the practice visited study physicians' 
      practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 scenarios: 
      28-year-old woman, 52-year-old woman, 48-year-old man and 70-year-old man. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician characteristics, encounter characteristics and 
      charges made for services. RESULTS: The 62 physicians had 246 encounters with the 
      standardized patients. Charges were made to the health insurance plan for 
      services by 59 physicians for up to 4 encounters (215 encounters in all). Charges 
      varied considerably both within and across patient scenarios. Time spent with the 
      patient was an important factor predicting charges made (p < 0.01), although the 
      effect of time spent on charges varied across scenarios (p < 0.01). 
      Fee-for-service physicians charged more for their services than physicians who 
      usually had alternative billing arrangements (p < 0.01). Female physicians 
      charged more for their services than their male colleagues (p = 0.03). No 
      relation was found between quality of preventive care and charges made (p = 
      0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Physician-related factors are better able to account for the 
      variability in charges for their services than patient-related factors. 
      Physicians seeing comparable patients may earn much more or less than their 
      colleagues because of differences in the services they provide and the way they 
      apply the fee schedule. Quality-assurance techniques are likely needed to reduce 
      the variability in charges seen and increase value for money spent in health 
      care.

TI  - Fielding standardized patients in primary care settings: lessons from a study 
      using unannounced standardized patients to assess preventive care practices.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document detection and suspicion rates of unannounced standardized 
      patients visiting community-based practices. DESIGN: Primary care physicians were 
      recruited to participate in a study using standardized patients. Four 
      standardized patient scenarios were used. SETTING: Community-based primary care 
      physicians' practices in southern Ontario between September 1994 and August 1995. 
      STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two primary care physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 
      'believability' questionnaire completed after all four standardized patients had 
      visited the practices. RESULTS: Of the primary care physicians approached, 50% 
      (62) agreed to participate. Twenty-one per cent of all visits were suspected as 
      standardized patient encounters. Forty-six per cent suspected one or more 
      standardized patients. Only five physicians (8%) suspected all four standardized 
      patients. Reasons for suspecting standardized patients were associated with the 
      characteristics of the physician's practices, the physician's practice profile 
      and the standardized patient cover story. CONCLUSION: The portrayal of 
      asymptomatic patients seeking a new primary care physician presents unique 
      challenges. Carefully constructed cover stories, and detailed knowledge of the 
      local area and of the practices of the participating physicians is required to 
      allow standardized patients cases to be tailored to fit into primary care 
      settings without arousing suspicion.

TI  - Understanding the role of contextual influences on local health-care decision 
      making: case study results from Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 777-93
AB  - Approaches to involving the public in local health care decision making processes 
      (and analyses of these approaches) have tended to treat participation and publics 
      uniformly in search of the ideal method of involving the public or providing the 
      same opportunities for public participation regardless of differing 
      socio-economic, cultural, insitutional or political contexts within which 
      decisions are made. Less attention has been given to the potential for various 
      contextual factors to influence both the methods employed and the outcomes of 
      such community decision-making processes. The paper explores the role that 
      context (three sets of contextual influences more specifically) plays in shaping 
      community decision-making processes. Results from case studies of public 
      participation in local health-care decision making in four geographic communities 
      in Ontario are presented. During the study period, two of these communities were 
      actively involved in health services restructuring processes while one had 
      recently completed its process and the fourth had not yet engaged in one. Several 
      themes emerge from the case studies regarding the identification and role of 
      contextual influences in differentially shaping participation in local health 
      care decision-making. These include the propensity for communities with different 
      social and structural attributes to engage in different "styles" of 
      participation; the importance attached to "community values" in shaping both the 
      qualitative and quantitative aspects of participation: the role of health 
      councils, local government and inter-organizational collaboration as 
      participation "enablers"; and the politicization of participation that occurs 
      around contentious issues such as hospital closures.

TI  - Primary care in Canada: so much innovation, so little change.
PG  - 116-31
AB  - The development of Canadian primary care has been shaped by a series of policy 
      legacies that continue to affect the possibilities for change in primary care 
      through their cumulative effects on the health care system and the process of 
      health policy development. The pursuit of radical systemwide change in the face 
      of unfavorable circumstances (created in large part by those legacies) has 
      resulted in missed opportunities for cumulative incremental change. While major 
      changes in primary care policy seem unlikely in the near future, significant 
      incremental change is possible, but it will require a reorientation of the policy 
      development process.

TI  - Examining the role of health services research in public policymaking.
PG  - 125-54
AB  - Conceptual, methodological, and practical issues await those who seek to 
      understand how to make better use of health services research in developing 
      public policy. Some policies and some policymaking processes may lend themselves 
      particularly well to being informed by research. Different conclusions about the 
      extent to which policymaking is informed by research may arise from different 
      views about what constitutes health services research (is it citable research or 
      any professional social inquiry that can aid in problem solving?) or different 
      views about what constitutes research use (is it explicit uses of research only, 
      or does it also include tacit knowledge or the positions of stakeholders when 
      they are informed by research and are influential in the policymaking process?). 
      Some conditions may favor the use of research in policymaking, like sustained 
      interactions between researchers and policymakers. Results from an exploratory 
      study on the use of health services research by Canadian provincial policymakers 
      illustrate these issues.

TI  - Deliberations about deliberative methods: issues in the design and evaluation of 
      public participation processes.
PG  - 239-51
AB  - A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the 
      need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision 
      makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly 
      complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has 
      weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision 
      options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which 
      all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative 
      methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic 
      theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within 
      the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are 
      deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their 
      potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the 
      literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to 
      guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the 
      health-care sector in particular.

PG  - 221-48, 171-2
AB  - Five questions--What should be transferred to decision makers? To whom should it 
      be transferred? By whom? How? With what effect?--provide an organizing framework 
      for a knowledge transfer strategy. Opportunities for improving how research 
      organizations transfer research knowledge can be found in the differences between 
      the answers suggested by our understanding of the research literature and those 
      provided by research-organization directors asked to describe what they do. In 
      Canada, these opportunities include developing actionable messages for decision 
      makers (only 30 percent of research organizations frequently or always do this), 
      developing knowledge-uptake skills in target audiences and knowledge-transfer 
      skills in research organizations (only 20 to 22 percent frequently or always do 
      this), and evaluating the impact of knowledge-transfer activities (only 8 to 12 
      percent frequently or always conduct an evaluation). Research funders can help 
      research organizations take advantage of these opportunities.

PG  - 95-106
AB  - How to involve the public in setting health and health care priorities is a 
      constant challenge for health system decisions. Policy maker interest in 
      involving the public in increasingly complex and value-laden priority setting 
      processes has led to the use of deliberative public involvement methods designed 
      to promote discussion and debate among participants with the objective of 
      obtaining more informed and consensual views. These methods have not been 
      evaluated rigorously using controlled designs with pre- and post-test 
      measurements. We examined, using a controlled design, the effects of introducing 
      different opportunities for deliberation into a process for obtaining public 
      input into a community health goals priority setting process. Our findings 
      indicate that deliberation does make a difference to participant views. As more 
      deliberation is introduced, participant views may be more amenable to change. 
      Deliberation also offers the potential for views to become more rather than less 
      entrenched. While we are beginning to understand the difference deliberation 
      makes to participant views, we are still at an early stage in understanding the 
      process through which these differences come about and what difference 
      deliberation makes to broader outcomes such as civic competence, civic engagement 
      and health policy decisions.

TI  - The policy analysis of 'values talk': lessons from Canadian health reform.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - Despite widespread recognition of the importance of values, decision makers and 
      stakeholders in health policy appear to disagree fundamentally over what 'values' 
      essentially are. Hidden dissent about the nature of values can confuse policy 
      deliberations. This study investigates empirically the following two questions: 
      (1) what sorts of entities do Canadian health reformers typically call 'values'? 
      and; (2) how do Canadian health reformers use the idea of values in health reform 
      rhetoric? We conducted a qualitative, interpretive analysis of 36 Canadian health 
      reform documents published during the period 1990-1999. The values raised in 
      Canadian health reform rhetoric vary widely not only in topic (e.g. health 
      states, health services, equity, economic viability, etc.) but also in substance 
      (e.g. physical entities, goals, principles, attitudes, etc.). We review the 
      diversity of concepts underlying 'values talk' in health policy, and discuss 
      implications for policy analysis and future research.

TI  - Managing under managed community care: the experiences of clients, providers and 
      managers in Ontario's competitive home care sector.
PG  - 359-72
AB  - In 1996, a newly elected government in the Province of Ontario, Canada, 
      introduced a managed competition environment into the home care sector through 
      the establishment of a competitive contracting process for home care services. 
      Through 65 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between November 1999 
      and January 2001, we trace the implementation of this competitive contracting 
      policy within Ontario's newly established managed community care environment and 
      assess the effects of competitive contracting against two sets of goals: (1). 
      quality of care goals that consider continuity of care of paramount importance in 
      the provision of home care; and (2). the managed competition goal of increased 
      efficiency. In assessing the implementation of this policy against these goals, 
      we highlight the conflicts that can arise in pursuing different policy goals in 
      response to different formulations of the policy problem that underpin them. We 
      map stakeholder experiences with the competitive contracting policy onto relevant 
      contracting and managed competition literatures. When measured against the goals 
      of quality of care and efficiency, the findings presented here offer a mixed 
      review of the experiences to date with the competitive contracting process 
      introduced in Ontario's home care sector and suggest improvements for managing 
      future competitive contracting processes.

TI  - Canadians confront health care reform.
PG  - 186-93
AB  - In 2002 Canadians were less anxious about the state of their health care system 
      than they were a few years earlier, when perceptions peaked that the system 
      needed major reform. They expressed strong support in 2002 for maintaining the 
      status quo on health care financing (that is, no user fees and no two-tier care) 
      within the traditional domains of physician and hospital care. But they appeared 
      more receptive to two-tier care and for-profit delivery for the newer and rapidly 
      expanding domains of home care and high-tech care.

TI  - Will it make a difference if I show up and share? A citizens' perspective on 
      improving public involvement processes for health system decision-making.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health policy decision-makers are grappling with increasingly 
      complex and ethically controversial decisions at a time when citizens are 
      demanding more involvement in these decision processes. OBJECTIVES: To assess and 
      revise a set of guiding principles for the design of public involvement processes 
      generated from a synthesis of public participation design and evaluation 
      frameworks that can be used to inform the design and evaluation of future public 
      participation processes in the health sector. METHODS: Six focus groups held in 
      five Canadian provinces comprising citizens with considerable experience of 
      public participation processes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that 
      citizen participants are highly critical of, and discerning about,their public 
      participation experiences. Yet, they are optimistic and determined to contribute 
      in meaningful ways to future public policy processes. They are clear about where 
      improvements are needed and give top priority to what information is shared, and 
      how, among participants and decision-makers. The views of experienced citizens 
      mapped well onto most of the prior principles of public involvement with a few 
      modifications. First, participants gave greater emphasis to the content and 
      balance of information for the purposes of building trust and credibility between 
      citizens and decision-makers. Second, participants viewed themselves, as well as 
      decision-makers, as sources of information to be shared through the consultation 
      process. Finally, participants stressed the importance of getting the information 
      and communication principles right over addressing all other principles.

TI  - From rhetoric to reality: including patient voices in supportive cancer care 
      planning.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the extent and manner of patient participation in the 
      planning of regional supportive care networks throughout the province of Ontario. 
      We consider the disconnect between the rhetoric and reality of patient 
      involvement in network planning and co-ordination. CONTEXT: In 1997, the Province 
      of Ontario, Canada, established a new, regionalized cancer care system. By 
      transferring responsibility to the regional level and to networks, the architects 
      of the new provincial system hoped to broaden participation in decision making 
      and to enhance the responsiveness of decisions to communities. RESEARCH APPROACH: 
      Through a qualitative, multiple case study approach we evaluated the processes of 
      involving patients in network development. In-depth, semi-structured interviews 
      and document analysis were complemented by observations of provincial meetings, 
      regional council and network meetings. RESULTS: The network development processes 
      in the three case study regions reveal a significant gap between intentions to 
      involve patients in health planning and their actual involvement. This gap can be 
      explained by: (i) a lack of clear direction regarding networks and patient 
      participation in these networks; (ii) the dominance of regional cancer centres in 
      network planning activities; and, (iii) the emergence of competing provincial 
      priorities. DISCUSSION: These three trends expose the complexity of the notion of 
      public participation and how it is embedded in social and political contexts. The 
      failed attempt at involving patients in health planning efforts is the result of 
      benign neglect of public participation intents and the social and political 
      contexts in which public and patient participation is meant to occur.

TI  - Bringing 'the public' into health technology assessment and coverage policy 
      decisions: from principles to practice.
PG  - 37-50
AB  - Those making health care coverage decisions rely on health technology assessment 
      (HTA) for crucial technical information. But coverage decision-making, and the 
      HTA that informs it, are also inherently political. They involve the values and 
      judgments of a range of stakeholders as well as the public. Moreover, governments 
      are politically accountable for their resource allocation decisions. Canadian 
      policy makers are at an early stage in the design of legitimate mechanisms for 
      the public to contribute to, and to be apprised of, HTA and coverage decisions. 
      As they consider the options, questions arise about whom to involve (e.g., which 
      publics), how to engage them (e.g., through what public involvement or 
      accountability mechanisms), and for what purpose (e.g., to inform the public of 
      decisions and their rationales, or to have the public directly affect those 
      decisions). Often key concepts, such as the difference between public 
      accountability and public participation, are not well articulated or 
      distinguished in these debates. Guidance is needed regarding both rationales and 
      methods for involving the public in HTA and technology coverage decisions. We 
      offer a framework that clearly distinguishes specific roles for the public, and 
      relates them to several layers of policy analysis and policy making where 'the 
      public' may engage in different tasks. The framework offers a menu of choices for 
      policy makers contemplating changes to public involvement, as well as a model 
      that can be used to characterize and analyze different approaches across 
      jurisdictions.

TI  - Examining the role of context in the implementation of a deliberative public 
      participation experiment: results from a Canadian comparative study.
PG  - 2115-28
AB  - To resolve tensions among competing sources of evidence and public expectations, 
      health-care managers and policy makers are turning more than ever to involve the 
      public in a wide range of decisions. Yet efforts to use research evidence to 
      inform public involvement decisions are hampered by an absence of rigorous public 
      participation evaluation research. In particular, greater rigour in exploring the 
      roles played by different contextual variables--such as characteristics of the 
      issue of interest, the culture of the sponsoring organization and attributes of 
      the decision being made--is needed. Using a comparative quasi-experimental 
      design, we assessed the performance of a generic public participation method 
      implemented in 5 Canadian regionalized health settings between 2001 and 2004. 
      Participant and decision-maker perspectives were assessed and, through direct 
      observation, the roles exerted by contextual variables over the public 
      involvement processes were documented and analysed. Our findings demonstrate that 
      a generic public participation method can be implemented in a variety of contexts 
      and with considerable success. Context exerts fostering and inhibiting influences 
      that contribute to more (or less) successful implementation. Public participation 
      practitioners are encouraged to pay careful attention to the types of issues and 
      decisions for which they are seeking public input. Sufficient organizational 
      resources and commitment to the goals of the public participation process are 
      also required. Attention to these contextual attributes and their influence on 
      the design and outcomes of public participation processes is as important as 
      choosing the "right" public participation mechanism.

TI  - Mental health service delivery in Ontario, Canada: how do policy legacies shape 
      prospects for reform?
PG  - 363-89
LID - 10.1017/S1744133107004318 [doi]
AB  - Like many jurisdictions, mental health policy-making in Ontario, Canada, has a 
      long history of frustrated attempts to move from a hospital and physician-based 
      tradition to a coordinated system with greater emphasis on community-based mental 
      health care. This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction 
      of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and of public health insurance (medicare) 
      in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform 
      initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we 
      capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on 
      three groups of actors: government elites, interests, and mass publics. Data are 
      drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The 
      findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy produced important policy 
      legacies which were reinforced by the establishment of Canadian medicare. These 
      legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, 
      but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support 
      community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system presents an 
      opportunity to overcome several of these legacies. Analysis of policy legacies in 
      other countries which had an asylum tradition may help to explain the 
      similarities and differences in their subsequent paths of mental health reform.

TI  - Alternatives to project-specific consent for access to personal information for 
      health research: insights from a public dialogue.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1472-6939-9-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of consent for research use of health information is 
      contentious. Most discussion has focused on when project-specific consent may be 
      waived but, recently, a broader range of consent options has been entertained, 
      including broad opt-in for multiple studies with restrictions and notification 
      with opt-out. We sought to elicit public values in this matter and to work toward 
      an agreement about a common approach to consent for use of personal information 
      for health research through deliberative public dialogues. METHODS: We conducted 
      seven day-long public dialogues, involving 98 participants across Canada. 
      Immediately before and after each dialogue, participants completed a 
      fixed-response questionnaire rating individuals' support for 3 approaches to 
      consent in the abstract and their consent choices for 5 health research scenarios 
      using personal information. They also rated how confident different safeguards 
      made them feel that their information was being used responsibly. RESULTS: Broad 
      opt-in consent for use of personal information garnered the greatest support in 
      the abstract. When presented with specific research scenarios, no one approach to 
      consent predominated. When profit was introduced into the scenarios, consent 
      choices shifted toward greater control over use. Despite lively and constructive 
      dialogues, and considerable shifting in opinion at the individual level, at the 
      end of the day, there was no substantive aggregate movement in opinion. Personal 
      controls were among the most commonly cited approaches to improving people's 
      confidence in the responsible use of their information for research. CONCLUSION: 
      Because no one approach to consent satisfied even a simple majority of dialogue 
      participants and the importance placed on personal controls, a mechanism should 
      be developed for documenting consent choice for different types of research, 
      including ways for individuals to check who has accessed their medical record for 
      purposes other than clinical care. This could be done, for example, through a 
      web-based patient portal to their electronic health record. Researchers and 
      policy makers should continue to engage the public to promote greater public 
      understanding of the research process and to look for feasible alternatives to 
      existing approaches to project-specific consent for observational research.

TI  - What does it mean to trust a health system? A qualitative study of Canadian 
      health care values.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.11.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used a qualitative empirical study of Canadians' values toward 
      their health system to develop more meaningful conceptualizations of trust and 
      health systems that can inform the pursuit of more trustworthy health systems. 
      METHODS: We convened nine focus groups in three Canadian cities in 2002 and 2004 
      in conjunction with a national public opinion telephone survey of Canadians' 
      attitudes and values toward their health system. Health system trust emerged as a 
      significant theme in focus group discussions and was investigated using a 
      modified grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: Respondents construct cleavages and 
      alliances to position themselves in relation to different features of the trusted 
      health system. The health system and Canadian Medicare are identified sources of 
      trust just as are individual health care providers. Core to the trust 
      relationship is the experience of vulnerability which provides the impetus for 
      placing trust (in providers, governments and health systems) or seeds distrust, 
      mistrust and resilience in the same. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a more robust 
      conceptualization of what it means to trust a health system. Policy maker efforts 
      to intervene to restore lost trust could usefully be informed by these findings.

TI  - Media Hyping and the "Herceptin Access Story": An Analysis of Canadian and UK 
      Newspaper Coverage.
PG  - e113-28
AB  - In May 2005, preliminary trial results pronouncing the effectiveness of Herceptin 
      (trastuzumab) for treatment of early-stage breast cancer were disseminated at a 
      high-profile scientific meeting. Herceptin was subsequently approved for use in 
      the public healthcare systems of Canada and the United Kingdom, although the 
      differences between the two decision timelines were stark. The authors compared 
      UK and Canadian newspaper coverage of the Herceptin story to assess how it may 
      have been "hyped" in each country. They analyzed a diverse sample of newspapers 
      and coded clippings for reporters' framing of the drug's efficacy, costs and 
      funding approval process. Canadian news coverage preceded formal publication of 
      the trial results, while UK coverage mirrored major national events. Reporters in 
      both countries used predominantly individualistic perspectives and framed 
      Herceptin's efficacy in salutary terms. Framing of costs was more neutral in 
      Canadian than in UK newspapers. Funding approval framing focused on inequitable 
      access in the UK and timeliness in Canada. News coverage of drug access stories 
      varies across jurisdictions in terms of intensity and some aspects of framing. 
      Such variations likely reflect different journalistic practices and dominant 
      political rhetoric. Greater attention should be given to the role that news 
      coverage of drug access plays in shaping public opinion and policy action, 
      especially when this coverage precedes scientific debate.

TI  - Development of a framework for effective community engagement in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 59-69
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to: (1) conceptualize effective community engagement 
      (CE) within the Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) of Ontario, Canada, (2) 
      develop an effective CE framework and (3) compare the CE framework to public 
      engagement (PE) frameworks and assess their relevance to the LHIN context. 
      METHODS: We implemented "concept mapping," a participatory, mixed-methods 
      approach, with LHIN staff. The method includes three components: (1) 
      "Brainstorming" where participants generated statements describing effective CE; 
      (2) "Sorting and Rating" where participants grouped statements and rated their 
      relative importance to generate a "cluster map" and (3) "Mapping" where 
      participants reviewed and named the clusters to yield the effective CE framework. 
      RESULTS: Staff generated a list of 64 statements. Participants reviewed the 
      cluster map to generate six categories for the framework: (1) collaboration, (2) 
      accessibility, (3) accountability, (4) education, (5) principles and (6) 
      organizational capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The effective CE framework overlaps with PE 
      frameworks with two caveats. First, applications of PE evaluation frameworks to 
      the LHINs may yield incomplete results given that partnerships with service 
      providers and organizations are integral to CE strategies. Second, 
      "organizational capacity," largely not captured within existing frameworks, must 
      be integrated as a feature given that emerging research identifies its importance 
      to the successful implementation of engagement strategies.

TI  - Advanced practice nursing in Canada: overview of a decision support synthesis.
PG  - 15-34
AB  - The objective of this decision support synthesis was to identify and review 
      published and grey literature and to conduct stakeholder interviews to (1) 
      describe the distinguishing characteristics of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) 
      and nurse practitioner (NP) role definitions and competencies relevant to 
      Canadian contexts, (2) identify the key barriers and facilitators for the 
      effective development and utilization of CNS and NP roles and (3) inform the 
      development of evidence-based recommendations for the individual, organizational 
      and system supports required to better integrate CNS and NP roles into the 
      Canadian healthcare system and advance the delivery of nursing and patient care 
      services in Canada. Four types of advanced practice nurses (APNs) were the focus: 
      CNSs, primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), acute care nurse 
      practitioners (ACNPs) and a blended CNS/NP role. We worked with a 
      multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional advisory board that helped identify 
      documents and key informant interviewees, develop interview questions and 
      formulate implications from our findings. We included 468 published and 
      unpublished English- and French-language papers in a scoping review of the 
      literature. We conducted interviews in English and French with 62 Canadian and 
      international key informants (APNs, healthcare administrators, policy makers, 
      nursing regulators, educators, physicians and other team members). We conducted 
      four focus groups with a total of 19 APNs, educators, administrators and policy 
      makers. A multidisciplinary roundtable convened by the Canadian Health Services 
      Research Foundation formulated evidence-informed policy and practice 
      recommendations based on the synthesis findings. This paper forms the foundation 
      for this special issue, which contains 10 papers summarizing different dimensions 
      of our synthesis. Here, we summarize the synthesis methods and the 
      recommendations formulated at the roundtable.

TI  - Factors enabling advanced practice nursing role integration in Canada.
PG  - 211-38
AB  - Although advanced practice nurses (APNs) have existed in Canada for over 40 years 
      and there is abundant evidence of their safety and effectiveness, their full 
      integration into our healthcare system has not been fully realized. For this 
      paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the Canadian 
      literature from 1990 onward and interviews or focus groups with 81 key informants 
      conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to 
      identify the factors that enable role development and implementation across the 
      three types of APNs: clinical nurse specialists, primary healthcare nurse 
      practitioners and acute care nurse practitioners. For development of advanced 
      practice nursing roles, many of the enabling factors occur at the 
      federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) level. They include utilization of a 
      pan-Canadian approach, provision of high-quality education, and development of 
      appropriate legislative and regulatory mechanisms. Systematic planning to guide 
      role development is needed at both the F/P/T and organizational levels. For 
      implementation of advanced practice nursing roles, some of the enabling factors 
      require action at the F/P/T level. They include recruitment and retention, role 
      funding, intra-professional relations between clinical nurse specialists and 
      nurse practitioners, public awareness, national leadership support and role 
      evaluation. Factors requiring action at the level of the organization include 
      role clarity, healthcare setting support, implementation of all role components 
      and continuing education. Finally, inter-professional relations require action at 
      both the F/P/T and organizational levels. A multidisciplinary roundtable 
      formulated policy and practice recommendations based on the synthesis findings, 
      and these are summarized in this paper.

TI  - Utilization of nurse practitioners to increase patient access to primary 
      healthcare in Canada--thinking outside the box.
PG  - 239-59
AB  - In the past decade, all Canadian provinces and territories have launched various 
      team-based primary healthcare initiatives designed to improve access and 
      continuity of care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly becoming integral 
      members of primary healthcare teams across the country. This paper draws on the 
      results of a scoping review of the literature and qualitative key informant 
      interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis about advanced practice 
      nursing in Canada. We describe and analyze two novel approaches to NP integration 
      designed to address the gap in patient access to primary healthcare: (1) the 
      integration of NPs in traditional fee-for-service practices in British Columbia, 
      and (2) the creation of NP-led clinics in Ontario. Although fee-for-service 
      remuneration has been a barrier to collaborative practice, the integration of 
      government-salaried NPs into fee-for-service practices in British Columbia has 
      enabled the creation of inter-professional teams, and based on early evaluation 
      findings, has increased patient access to care and patient and provider 
      satisfaction. NP-led clinics are designed to provide inter-professional care in 
      communities with high numbers of patients who do not have a regular primary 
      healthcare provider. Given the shortage of physicians in communities where these 
      clinics are being introduced, the ratio of physicians to NPs is lower than in 
      other primary healthcare delivery models, and physicians function in more of a 
      consulting role. Initial evaluation of the first of 26 NP-led clinics indicates 
      increased access to care and high levels of patient and provider satisfaction. 
      Implementing a creative mosaic of collaborative primary healthcare models that 
      are responsive to patient needs challenges traditional assumptions about 
      professional roles and responsibilities. To address this challenge, we endorse a 
      recommendation that governments establish a mechanism to bring together both 
      physician and non-physician primary healthcare providers to advise on primary 
      healthcare policy development and implementation.

TI  - Analyzing the influence of institutions on health policy development in Uganda: a 
      case study of the decision to abolish user fees.
PG  - 578-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 2001 election campaign, President Yoweri Museveni 
      announced he was abolishing user fees for health services in Uganda. No analysis 
      has been carried out to explain how he was able to initiate such an important 
      policy decision without encountering any immediate barriers. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain this outcome through in-depth policy analysis driven by the application 
      of key analytical frameworks. METHODS: An explanatory case study informed by 
      analytical frameworks from the institutionalism literature was undertaken. 
      Multiple data sources were used including: academic literature, key government 
      documents, grey literature, and a variety of print media. RESULTS: According to 
      the analytical frameworks employed, several formal institutional constraints 
      existed that would have reduced the prospects for the abolition of user fees. 
      However, prevalent informal institutions such as "Big Man" presidentialism and 
      clientelism that were both 'competing' and 'complementary' can be used to explain 
      the policy outcome. The analysis suggests that these factors trumped the impact 
      of more formal institutional structures in the Ugandan context. CONCLUSION: 
      Consideration should be given to the interactions between formal and informal 
      institutions in the analysis of health policy processes in Uganda, as they 
      provide a more nuanced understanding of how each set of factors influence policy 
      outcomes.

AB  - Models that describe the key features and intended effects of specific knowledge 
      translation and exchange (KTE) interventions are much less prominent than models 
      that provide a more general understanding of KTE. Our aim was to develop a model 
      in order to describe the key features and intended effects of deliberative 
      dialogues used as a KTE strategy and to understand how deliberative dialogues can 
      support evidence-informed policymaking. By using critical interpretive synthesis, 
      we identified 17 papers representing four fields of enquiry and integrated our 
      findings into a model. The key features described in the model are: 1) an 
      appropriate (i.e., conducive to the particular dialogue) meeting environment; 2) 
      an appropriate mix of participants; and, 3) an appropriate use of research 
      evidence. These features combine to create three types of intended effects: 1) 
      short-term individual-level; 3) medium-term community/organizational-level; and, 
      3) long-term system-level. The concept of capacity building helps to explain the 
      relationship between features and effects. The model is a useful contribution to 
      the KTE field because it is a practical tool that could be used to guide the 
      development and evaluation of deliberative dialogues in order to understand more 
      about achieving particular outcomes in relation to specific issues or contexts.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impacts of a Citizens' Reference Panel on the 
      deliberations of a provincial health technology advisory committee and its 
      secretariat, which produce, recommendations for the use of health technologies in 
      Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A fourteen-member citizens' reference panel was 
      convened five times between February 2009 and May 2010 to participate in 
      informed, facilitated discussions to inform the assessment of individual 
      technologies and provincial health technology assessment processes more 
      generally. Qualitative data collection methods were used to document observed and 
      perceived impacts of the citizens' panel on the health technology assessment 
      (HTA) process. RESULTS: Panel impacts were observed for all technologies 
      reviewed, at two different stages in the HTA process, and represented macro- 
      (raising awareness) and micro-level (informing recommendations) impacts. These 
      impacts were shaped by periodic opportunities for direct and brokered exchange 
      between the Panel and the expert advisory committee to clarify roles, foster 
      accountability, and build trust. Our findings offer new insights about one of the 
      main considerations in the design of deliberative participatory structures-how to 
      maintain the independence of a citizens' panel while ensuring that their input is 
      considered at key junctures in the HTA process. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens' panels can 
      exert various impacts on the HTA process. Ensuring these types of structures 
      include opportunities for direct exchange between citizens and experts, to 
      clarify roles, promote accountability, and build trust will facilitate their 
      impacts in a variety of settings.

TI  - How contexts and issues influence the use of policy-relevant research syntheses: 
      a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 604-48
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12026 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Evidence briefs have emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing the 
      best available research evidence for health system policymakers and stakeholders. 
      An evidence brief may draw on systematic reviews and many other types of 
      policy-relevant information, including local data and studies, to describe a 
      problem, options for addressing it, and key implementation considerations. We 
      conducted a systematic review to examine the ways in which context- and 
      issue-related factors influence the perceived usefulness of evidence briefs among 
      their intended users. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis approach 
      to review both empirical and nonempirical literature and to develop a model that 
      explains how context and issues influence policymakers' and stakeholders' views 
      of the utility of evidence briefs prepared for priority policy issues. We used a 
      "compass" question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic 
      searches in CINAHL, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, IPSA, MEDLINE, OAIster (gray literature), 
      ProQuest A&I Theses, ProQuest (Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences 
      Index and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International 
      Bibliography of Social Sciences, PAIS, Political Science), PsychInfo, Web of 
      Science, and WilsonWeb (Social Science Abstracts). Finally, we used a grounded 
      and interpretive analytic approach to synthesize the results. FINDINGS: Of the 
      4,461 papers retrieved, 3,908 were excluded and 553 were assessed for 
      "relevance," with 137 included in the initial sample of papers to be analyzed and 
      an additional 23 purposively sampled to fill conceptual gaps. Several themes 
      emerged: (1) many established types of "evidence" are viewed as useful content in 
      an evidence brief, along with several promising formatting features; (2) 
      contextual factors, particularly the institutions, interests, and values of a 
      given context, can influence views of evidence briefs; (3) whether an issue is 
      polarizing and whether it is salient (or not) and familiar (or not) to actors in 
      the policy arena can influence views of evidence briefs prepared for that issue; 
      (4) influential factors can emerge in several ways (as context driven, issue 
      driven, or a result of issue-context resonance); (5) these factors work through 
      two primary pathways, affecting either the users or the producers of briefs; and 
      (6) these factors influence views of evidence briefs through a variety of 
      mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Those persons funding and preparing evidence briefs need 
      to consider a variety of context- and issue-related factors when deciding how to 
      make them most useful in policymaking.

AB  - The concept of public involvement use is not well-defined in the literature. 
      Previous research studies have provided brief accounts of how public involvement 
      may influence health policy, but have not detailed the internal dynamics and 
      process through which it is actually used in the policy process. The study 
      objective is to examine and clarify the concept and process of public involvement 
      use in health policy decision-making. Using qualitative concept analysis methods, 
      we reviewed the literature on the use of public involvement and conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with key informants who have theoretical and/or 
      practical insights on public involvement and its use in policy decision-making. 
      Our findings are organized around interrelated questions that animate how the 
      concept of use is understood, interpreted, and operationalized. In asking, "How 
      is 'use' perceived in relation to health policy decision-making?" meanings are 
      constructed for the concept by identifying differences and drawing connections 
      between "use" and related terms. In asking "How would one know if public 
      involvement was used in health policy decision-making?" our findings weigh in on 
      the act of listening as a precursor to use, the ways in which use is mediated, 
      and responses to the input obtained from public involvement processes as signals 
      of use. These findings are a first step toward improving conceptual clarity about 
      what public involvement use means, how it is understood and interpreted by 
      relevant actors in the public involvement and public policy fields, and how it 
      might be operationalized. We expect our findings to be particularly useful for 
      public involvement practitioners who are often confronted with questions from 
      public involvement participants regarding how their input will be used in health 
      policy decision-making.

      development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation 
      Tool.
PG  - 817-27

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Only rudimentary tools exist to support health system organizations 
      to evaluate their public and patient engagement (PPE) activities. This study 
      responds to this gap by developing a generic evaluation tool for use in a wide 
      range of organizations. METHODS: The evaluation tool was developed through an 
      iterative, collaborative process informed by a review of published and grey 
      literature and with the input of Canadian PPE researchers and practitioners. Over 
      a 3-year period, structured e-mail, telephone and face-to-face exchanges, 
      including a modified Delphi process, were used to produce an evaluation tool that 
      includes core principles of high-quality engagement, expected outcomes for each 
      principle and three unique evaluation questionnaires that were tested and revised 
      with input from 65 end users. RESULTS: The tool is structured around four core 
      principles of 'quality engagement': (i) integrity of design and process; (ii) 
      influence and impact; (iii) participatory culture; and (iv) collaboration and 
      common purpose. Three unique questionnaires were developed to assess each of 
      these four evaluation domains from the following perspectives: (i) those who 
      participate in PPE activities; (ii) those who plan, execute or sponsor PPE 
      activities within organizations; and (iii) those who provide the leadership and 
      capacity for PPE within their organizations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known 
      collaboration of researchers and practitioners in the co-design of a 
      comprehensive PPE evaluation tool aimed at three distinct respondent groups and 
      for use in a wide range of health system organization settings.

AB  - The community participation literature has produced numerous frameworks to guide 
      practice and evaluation of community participation strategies in the health 
      sector. These frameworks are useful starting points for differentiating the 
      approaches for involving people in planning and decision-making for health 
      services, but have been critiqued for being too generic and ignoring that 
      community participation is highly contextual and situational. Health service 
      organizations across Canada and internationally have begun to respond to address 
      this limitation by developing more context-specific community participation 
      frameworks; however, such frameworks do not exist for Ontario Community Health 
      Centres (CHCs)-local primary health care organizations with a mandate to engage 
      marginalized groups in planning and decision-making for health services. We 
      conducted a series of focus groups with staff members from four Ontario CHCs to: 
      (1) examine the factors that would influence their use of a generic framework for 
      community participation with marginalized populations; and (2) improve the 
      "context-specificity" of this framework, to enhance its relevance to CHCs. 
      Participants described the difficulty of organizing the contextual, multi-faceted 
      and situational process of community participation that they experienced with 
      marginalized populations into a single framework, which led them to question the 
      value of using frameworks as a resource for guiding the design, implementation 
      and evaluation of their community participation initiatives. Instead, 
      participants revealed that tacit knowledge, in the form of professional and 
      personal experience and local knowledge of a marginalized population, had a 
      greater influence on guiding participation activities in Ontario CHCs. Our 
      findings suggest that tacit knowledge is an essential feature of community 
      participation practice and requires further exploration regarding its role in the 
      community participation field.

      health service organization in Ontario, Canada.

LID - 10.1093/heapro/dav118 [doi]
AB  - We examined efforts to engage marginalized populations in Ontario Community 
      Health Centers (CHCs), which are primary health care organizations serving 74 
      high-risk communities. Qualitative case studies of community participation in 
      four Ontario CHCs were carried out through key informant interviews with CHC 
      staff to identify: (i) the approaches, strategies and methods used in 
      participation initiatives aimed specifically at engaging marginalized populations 
      in the planning of and decision making for health services; and (ii) the 
      challenges and enablers for engaging these populations. The marginalized 
      populations involved in the community participation initiatives studied included 
      Low-German Speaking Mennonites in a rural town, newcomer immigrants and refugees 
      in an urban downtown city, immigrant and francophone seniors in an inner city and 
      refugee women in an inner city. Our analysis revealed that enabling the 
      participation of marginalized populations requires CHCs to attend to the barriers 
      experienced by marginalized populations that constrain their participation. Key 
      informants outlined the features of a 'community development approach' that they 
      rely on to address the barriers to marginalized peoples' involvement by 
      strengthening their skills, abilities and leadership in capacity-building 
      activities. The community development approach also shaped the participation 
      methods that were used in the engagement process of CHCs. However, key informants 
      also described the challenges of applying this approach, influenced by the 
      cultural values of some groups, which shaped their willingness and motivation to 
      participate. This study provides further insight into the approach, strategies 
      and methods used in the engagement process to enable the participation of 
      marginalized populations, which may be transferable to other health services 
      settings.

TI  - Why do policies change? Institutions, interests, ideas and networks in three 
      cases of policy reform.
PG  - 1200-11
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czw052 [doi]
AB  - Policy researchers have used various categories of variables to explain why 
      policies change, including those related to institutions, interests and ideas. 
      Recent research has paid growing attention to the role of policy networks-the 
      actors involved in policy-making, their relationships with each other, and the 
      structure formed by those relationships-in policy reform across settings and 
      issues; however, this literature has largely ignored the theoretical integration 
      of networks with other policy theories, including the '3Is' of institutions, 
      interests and ideas. This article proposes a conceptual framework integrating 
      these variables and tests it on three cases of policy change in Burkina Faso, 
      addressing the need for theoretical integration with networks as well as the 
      broader aim of theory-driven health policy analysis research in low- and 
      middle-income countries. We use historical process tracing, a type of comparative 
      case study, to interpret and compare documents and in-depth interview data within 
      and between cases. We found that while network changes were indeed associated 
      with policy reform, this relationship was mediated by one or more of 
      institutions, interests and ideas. In a context of high donor dependency, new 
      donor rules affected the composition and structure of actors in the networks, 
      which enabled the entry and dissemination of new ideas and shifts in the overall 
      balance of interest power ultimately leading to policy change. The case of 
      strategic networking occurred in only one case, by civil society actors, 
      suggesting that network change is rarely the spark that initiates the process 
      towards policy change. This analysis highlights the important role of changes in 
      institutions and ideas to drive policymaking, but hints that network change is a 
      necessary intermediate step in these processes.

TI  - PUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: A FRAMEWORK FOR 
      ACTION.
PG  - 256-264
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As health technology assessment (HTA) organizations in Canada and 
      around the world seek to involve the public and patients in their activities, 
      frameworks to guide decisions about whom to involve, through which mechanisms, 
      and at what stages of the HTA process have been lacking. The aim of this study 
      was to describe the development and outputs of a comprehensive framework for 
      involving the public and patients in a government agency's HTA process. METHODS: 
      The framework was informed by a synthesis of international practice and published 
      literature, a dialogue with local, national and international stakeholders, and 
      the deliberations of a government agency's public engagement subcommittee in 
      Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: The practice and literature synthesis failed to 
      identify a single, optimal approach to involving the public and patients in HTA. 
      Choice of methods should be considered in the context of each HTA stage, goals 
      for incorporating societal and/or patient perspectives into the process, and 
      relevant societal and/or patient values at stake. The resulting framework is 
      structured around four actionable elements: (i) guiding principles and goals for 
      public and patient involvement (PPI) in HTA, (ii) the establishment of a common 
      language to support PPI efforts, (iii) a flexible array of PPI approaches, and 
      (iv) on-going evaluation of PPI to inform adjustments over time. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      public and patient involvement framework has been developed for implementation in 
      a government agency's HTA process. Core elements of this framework may apply to 
      other organizations responsible for HTA and health system quality improvement.

TI  - Uncomfortable trade-offs: Canadian policy makers' perspectives on setting 
      objectives for their health systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a wide range of health system performance indicators are 
      commonly reported on, there has been little effort to establish their relevance 
      to the objectives that health systems actually pursue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to identify, explore and better understand health policy makers' views 
      regarding the objectives and outcomes for their health systems, how they are 
      prioritized, and the underlying processes that yield them to inform the 
      development of health system efficiency measures. METHODS: A descriptive, 
      qualitative methodology was employed using key informant interviews with 17 
      current and former senior health ministry officials in 8 Canadian provinces and 2 
      territories. KEY FINDINGS: Health ministries have clearly stated objectives for 
      health systems focused on the achievement of health system delivery and 
      population health goals and, increasingly, public, patient and financial 
      accountability. Acute care objectives are routinely prioritized over population 
      health objectives and viewed as resulting from challenges associated with 
      difficult trade-off decisions shaped by organized interests and the media rather 
      than explicit, evidence-based processes. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights 
      beyond publicly available documents to explore the processes that underlie simple 
      statements of health system objectives. Our findings suggest that despite 
      respondents giving priority to improving individual and population health, it is 
      more commonly portrayed as an ideal objective than as a realistic one. By 
      understanding what lies behind statements about what health systems are striving 
      for, we offer a more robust avenue for increasing the uptake of future studies of 
      health system performance.

TI  - Primary Care Performance Measurement and Reporting at a Regional Level: Could a 
      Matrix Approach Provide Actionable Information for Policy Makers and Clinicians?
PG  - 33-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary care services form the foundation of modern healthcare 
      systems, yet the breadth and complexity of services and diversity of patient 
      populations may present challenges for creating comprehensive primary care 
      information systems. Our objective is to develop regional-level information on 
      the performance of primary care in Canada. METHODS: A scoping review was 
      conducted to identify existing initiatives in primary care performance 
      measurement and reporting across 11 countries. The results of this review were 
      used by our international team of primary care researchers and clinicians to 
      propose an approach for regional-level primary care reporting. RESULTS: We found 
      a gap between conceptual primary care performance measurement frameworks in the 
      peer-reviewed literature and real-world primary care performance measurement and 
      reporting activities. We did not find a conceptual framework or analytic approach 
      that could readily form the foundation of a regional-level primary care 
      information system. Therefore, we propose an approach to reporting comprehensive 
      and actionable performance information according to widely accepted core domains 
      of primary care as well as different patient population groups. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      approach that bridges the gap between conceptual frameworks and real-world 
      performance measurement and reporting initiatives could address some of the 
      potential pitfalls of existing ways of presenting performance information (i.e., 
      by single diseases or by age). This approach could produce meaningful and 
      actionable information on the quality of primary care services.

TI  - Questioning patient engagement: research scientists' perceptions of the 
      challenges of patient engagement in a cardiovascular research network.
PG  - 1573-1583
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S135457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient engagement in research is a dominant discourse in clinical 
      research settings as it is seen as a move toward sustainable and equitable health 
      care systems. In Canada, a key driver is the Strategy for Patient-Oriented 
      Research of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, which asserts that 
      meaningful patient engagement can only be fostered when stakeholders understand 
      its value. This study assessed researchers' perceptions of the meaning and value 
      of patient engagement in research within a Canadian cardiovascular research 
      network. In doing so, the secondary aim was to inform the development of a 
      structured patient engagement initiative by identifying potential challenges and 
      related mitigation strategies. METHODS: We employed a multi-method strategy 
      involving electronic surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews with 
      network research scientists across Canada. Interview data were analyzed using 
      thematic and content analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-eight electronic surveys (response rate =33%) and 16 
      interviews were completed with network members. Some participants were uncertain 
      about the meaning and value of patient engagement. While voicing guarded support, 
      four challenges relating to patient engagement were identified from the 
      interviews: 1) identification of representative and appropriate patients, 2) 
      uncertainty about the scope of patients' roles given concerns about knowledge 
      discrepancies, 3) a perceived lack of evidence of the impact of patient 
      engagement, and 4) the need for education and culture change as a prerequisite 
      for patient engagement. Research scientists were largely concerned that patients 
      untrained in science and tasked with conveying an authentic patient experience 
      and being a conduit for the voices of others might unsettle a traditional model 
      of conducting research. CONCLUSION: Concerns about patient involvement in 
      research were related to a lack of clarity about the meaning, process, and impact 
      of involvement. This study highlights the need for education on the meaning of 
      patient engagement, evidence of its impact, and guidance on practical aspects of 
      implementation within this research community.

TI  - Measuring Children's Mental Health in Ontario: Policy Issues and Prospects for 
      Change.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - Children's mental health in Canada is characterized by high needs coupled with 
      stark service shortfalls. In Ontario and in many provinces, addressing these 
      shortfalls is hampered by the absence of a measurement system, something that 
      researchers have long called for. This commentary aims to review the issues and 
      suggest prospects for improving the measurement of children's mental health in 
      Ontario and elsewhere. As background, we first describe the children's mental 
      health needs; outline the rationale for a measurement system; describe previous 
      attempts to introduce such systems, including in Ontario; and discuss the current 
      Ontario situation. We then explore some of the issues that constrain policy and 
      that need to be overcome, and suggest prospects for change - for advancing the 
      measurement of children's mental health in Ontario and Canada.

AB  - Evolving scientific evidence about mammography has raised new questions about the 
      net benefits of organized screening, yet gaps remain about women's current 
      screening practices, knowledge, attitudes and values toward screening to support 
      informed decision making in this area. We addressed this gap through an online 
      survey of 2000 screen-eligible women from Ontario, Canada in January 2016. 
      Likert-scaled and categorical questions were used to collect information about 
      screening practices, knowledge of benefits and risks of screening and underlying 
      attitudes and values toward screening. Results for all responses were summarized 
      using descriptive statistics. Comparison of results between ever screened versus 
      never screened respondents was performed using chi-squared tests. Most women felt 
      informed about screening yet had doubts about how informed their decisions were. 
      They were more confident in their knowledge of the benefits than the risks which 
      aligned with the emphasis given to benefits in discussions with health care 
      providers. The benefits of screening were linked with lowered anxiety about 
      breast cancer. The never screened were less likely to overstate the benefits of 
      screening, more likely to give weight to the risks, and less likely to report 
      anxiety or worry about breast cancer. Findings highlight the need for improved 
      communication strategies and decision supports that emphasize the provision of 
      current, balanced information about the benefits and risks of screening, both at 
      the population-level (through mass media) and within patient-provider 
      interactions. Sensitivity to the psychosocial factors that shape women's 
      attitudes toward mammography screening should be central to any strategy.

LID - 10.1111/hex.12804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts 
      remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in 
      individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and 
      health systems have been published. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and appraise 
      evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system 
      decision making. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 1980 
      and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database 
      of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey 
      literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and 
      engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the 
      evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and 
      public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. RESULTS: In total, 10 663 
      unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were 
      developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of 
      engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature 
      review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the 
      public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, 
      and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the 
      public. CONCLUSION: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support 
      patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. 
      However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed 
      could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their 
      design and reporting.

AB  - Despite Canada's long history with mammography screening, little is known about 
      citizens' perspectives about mammography and how best to support women to make 
      informed choices about screening. To address this gap, a series of four citizen 
      deliberation events were held in 2015-16 in Ontario, a Canadian province with an 
      organized population-based breast screening program in place since 1990. 
      Forty-nine individuals participated in four citizen panels, each comprising an 
      information session highlighting the evidence about mammography, and large- and 
      small-group deliberations about approaches to support informed decision making 
      for screening. Following their engagement with the research evidence about 
      mammography, participants expressed concern about their lack of full awareness of 
      the risks and benefits and a strong desire for choice when it comes to screening. 
      To support informed choice, mammography programs need to reflect the values of 
      information sharing, trust and transparency, financial accountability, and allow 
      for personal interactions and shared decision-making. Citizens are looking for 
      balanced information about the risks and benefits of screening presented in an 
      easy to understand, comprehensive, and transparent manner. Primary health care 
      providers and organized screening programs are important sources of information 
      about mammography and must be vigilant in their efforts to support informed 
      decision-making in this area by ensuring that the information materials they are 
      using are balanced and reflect current evidence.

      Research.
PG  - 675-705
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12354 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points Engaging and involving underrepresented communities when setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. Groups and individuals 
      from minority and underserved communities strongly prioritized child health and 
      mental health research, often choosing to invest at the highest possible level. 
      Groups consisting of predominantly Native American or Arab American participants 
      invested in culture and beliefs research at the highest level, while many groups 
      did not select it at all. The priority given to culture and beliefs research by 
      these groups illustrates the importance of paying special attention to unique 
      preferences, and not just commonly held views, when getting public input on 
      spending priorities for research. CONTEXT: A major contributor to health 
      disparities is the relative lack of resources-including resources for 
      science-allocated to address the health problems of those with disproportionately 
      greater needs. Engaging and involving underrepresented communities in setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. We engaged minority and 
      underserved communities in informed deliberations and report here their 
      priorities for health research. METHODS: Academic-community partnerships adapted 
      the simulation exercise CHAT for setting health research priorities. We had 
      participants from minority and medically underserved communities (47 groups, n = 
      519) throughout Michigan deliberate about health research priorities, and we used 
      surveys and CHAT software to collect the demographic characteristics and 
      priorities selected by individuals and groups. FINDINGS: The participants ranged 
      in age (18 to 88), included more women than men, and were overrepresented by 
      minority groups. Nearly all the deliberating groups selected child health and 
      mental health research (93.6% and 95.7%), and most invested at the highest level. 
      Aging, access, promote health, healthy environment, and what causes disease were 
      also prioritized by groups. Research on mental health and child health were high 
      priorities for individuals both before and after group deliberations. Access was 
      the only category more likely to be selected by individuals after group 
      deliberation (77.0 vs 84.0%, OR = 1.63, p = .005), while improve research, health 
      policy, and culture and beliefs were less likely to be selected after group 
      deliberations (all, p < .001). However, the level of investment in many 
      categories changed after the group deliberations. Participants identifying as 
      Black/African American were less likely to prioritize mental health research, and 
      those of Other race were more likely to prioritize culture and beliefs research. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minority and medically underserved communities overwhelmingly 
      prioritized mental health and child health research in informed deliberations 
      about spending priorities.

AB  - As efforts to actively involve patients, family members and the broader public in 
      health service improvement and system redesign have grown, increasing attention 
      has also been paid to evaluation of their engagement in the health system. We 
      discuss key concepts and approaches related to evaluation, drawing particular 
      attention to different and potentially competing goals, stakeholders and 
      epistemological entry points. Evaluation itself can be supported by an increasing 
      number of frameworks and tools, matched to the relevant purpose and approach. The 
      patient engagement evaluation field faces several challenges, including the need 
      for greater specification of both the form and the context of engagement, the 
      need to balance the measurement imperative with the relational aspects of care 
      and the need for supportive organizations with the capacity and commitment to 
      undertake high-quality engagement and its evaluation.

TI  - Addressing the affordability of cancer drugs: using deliberative public 
      engagement to inform health policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health system expenditure on cancer drugs is rising rapidly in many 
      OECD countries given the costly new treatments and increased rates of use due to 
      a growing and ageing population. These factors put considerable strain on the 
      sustainability of health systems worldwide, sparking public debate among 
      clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, policy-makers and citizens on issues of 
      affordability and equity. We engaged Canadians through a series of deliberative 
      public engagement events to determine their priorities for making cancer drug 
      funding decisions fair and sustainable in Canada's publicly financed health 
      system. METHODS: An approach to deliberation was developed based on the McMaster 
      Health Forum's citizen panels and the established Burgess and O'Doherty model of 
      deliberative public engagement. Six deliberations were held across Canada in 
      2016. Transcripts were coded in NVivo and analysed to determine where 
      participants' views converged and diverged. Recommendations were grouped 
      thematically. RESULTS: A total of 115 Canadians participated in the deliberative 
      events and developed 86 recommendations. Recommendations included the review and 
      regular re-review of approved drugs using 'real-world' evidence on effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness; prioritisation of treatments that restore patients' 
      independence, mental health and general well-being; ensuring that decision 
      processes, results and their rationales are transparent; and commitment to people 
      with similar needs receiving the same care regardless of where in Canada they 
      live. CONCLUSIONS: The next steps for policy-makers should be to develop 
      mechanisms for (1) re-reviewing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data for all 
      cancer drugs; (2) making disinvestments in cancer drugs that satisfy requirements 
      relating to grandfathering and compassionate access; (3) ensuring fair and 
      equitable access to cancer drugs for all Canadians; and (4) fostering a 
      pan-Canadian approach to cancer drug funding decisions.

TI  - Citizen perspectives on the use of publicly reported primary care performance 
      information: Results from citizen-patient dialogues in three Canadian provinces.
PG  - 974-982
LID - 10.1111/hex.12902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Performance measurement and reporting is proliferating in all sectors 
      of the healthcare system, including primary care, despite a dearth of evidence on 
      how the public uses reports on primary care performance. We explored how the 
      public might use this information, to guide the development of effective 
      reporting systems for primary care. METHODS: We conducted six full-day 
      deliberative dialogue sessions with a purposive sample of 56 citizen-patients 
      across three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia). 
      Participants identified how they would use publicly reported performance data. We 
      conducted a thematic analysis of the data by region. RESULTS: Common uses for 
      primary care performance information emerged across all sessions. Participants 
      most often discussed the utility of this information for community advocacy and 
      participation in health system decision making. Similar barriers for using 
      performance information to choose a primary care provider were identified in each 
      region including the perceived lack of choice of providers and the high value 
      placed on relationships with current providers. Finally, the value of public 
      performance reporting in enhancing trust that people would receive good care was 
      also a common theme. CONCLUSIONS: Citizen-patient perspectives highlight that 
      public reporting on primary care performance could promote the health system's 
      responsiveness by enabling public engagement in decision making at the community 
      level. The role of public reporting in promoting trust rather than empowering 
      patient choice may reflect unique elements of the Canadian health system's 
      context.

TI  - Who is in and who is out? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder participation in 
      priority setting for health in three districts in Uganda.
PG  - 358-369
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czz049 [doi]
AB  - Stakeholder participation is relevant in strengthening priority setting processes 
      for health worldwide, since it allows for inclusion of alternative perspectives 
      and values that can enhance the fairness, legitimacy and acceptability of 
      decisions. Low-income countries operating within decentralized systems recognize 
      the role played by sub-national administrative levels (such as districts) in 
      healthcare priority setting. In Uganda, decentralization is a vehicle for 
      facilitating stakeholder participation. Our objective was to examine 
      district-level decision-makers' perspectives on the participation of different 
      stakeholders, including challenges related to their participation. We further 
      sought to understand the leverages that allow these stakeholders to influence 
      priority setting processes. We used an interpretive description methodology 
      involving qualitative interviews. A total of 27 district-level decision-makers 
      from three districts in Uganda were interviewed. Respondents identified the 
      following stakeholder groups: politicians, technical experts, donors, 
      non-governmental organizations (NGO)/civil society organizations (CSO), cultural 
      and traditional leaders, and the public. Politicians, technical experts and 
      donors are the principal contributors to district-level priority setting and the 
      public is largely excluded. The main leverages for politicians were control over 
      the district budget and support of their electorate. Expertise was a 
      cross-cutting leverage for technical experts, donors and NGO/CSOs, while 
      financial and technical resources were leverages for donors and NGO/CSOs. 
      Cultural and traditional leaders' leverages were cultural knowledge and influence 
      over their followers. The public's leverage was indirect and exerted through 
      electoral power. Respondents made no mention of participation for vulnerable 
      groups. The public, particularly vulnerable groups, are left out of the priority 
      setting process for health at the district. Conflicting priorities, interests and 
      values are the main challenges facing stakeholders engaged in district-level 
      priority setting. Our findings have important implications for understanding how 
      different stakeholder groups shape the prioritization process and whether 
      representation can be an effective mechanism for participation in health-system 
      priority setting.

AB  - Including information and values from patients in HTA has the potential to 
      improve both the process and outcomes of health technology policy decisions. 
      Accordingly, funding and structural incentives to include patients in HTA 
      activities have increased over the past several years. Unfortunately, these 
      incentives have not yet been accompanied by a corresponding increase in 
      resources, time, or commitment to responsiveness. In this Perspectives piece, we 
      reflect on our collective experiences participating in, conducting, and 
      overseeing patient engagement activities within HTA to highlight the ethical 
      challenges associated with this area of activity. While we remain committed to 
      the idea that patient engagement activities strengthen the findings, relevance, 
      and legitimacy of health technology policy, we are deeply concerned about the 
      potential for these activities to do ethical harm. We use this analysis to call 
      for action to introduce strong protections against ethical violations that may 
      harm patients participating in HTA engagement activities.

TI  - Evaluating community deliberations about health research priorities.
PG  - 772-784

AB  - CONTEXT: Engaging underrepresented communities in health research priority 
      setting could make the scientific agenda more equitable and more responsive to 
      their needs. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate democratic deliberations engaging minority and 
      underserved communities in setting health research priorities. METHODS: 
      Participants from underrepresented communities throughout Michigan (47 groups, 
      n = 519) engaged in structured deliberations about health research priorities in 
      professionally facilitated groups. We evaluated some aspects of the structure, 
      process, and outcomes of deliberations, including representation, equality of 
      participation, participants' views of deliberations, and the impact of group 
      deliberations on individual participants' knowledge, attitudes, and points of 
      view. Follow-up interviews elicited richer descriptions of these and also 
      explored later effects on deliberators. RESULTS: Deliberators (age 18-88 years) 
      overrepresented minority groups. Participation in discussions was well 
      distributed. Deliberators improved their knowledge about disparities, but not 
      about health research. Participants, on average, supported using their group's 
      decision to inform decision makers and would trust a process like this to inform 
      funding decisions. Views of deliberations were the strongest predictor of these 
      outcomes. Follow-up interviews revealed deliberators were particularly struck by 
      their experience hearing and understanding other points of view, sometimes 
      surprised at the group's ability to reach agreement, and occasionally activated 
      to volunteer or advocate. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberations using a structured group 
      exercise to engage minority and underserved community members in setting health 
      research priorities met some important criteria for a fair, credible process that 
      could inform policy. Deliberations appeared to change some opinions, improved 
      some knowledge, and were judged by participants worth using to inform 
      policymakers.

TI  - Supporting the evaluation of public and patient engagement in health system 
      organizations: Results from an implementation research study.
PG  - 1132-1143

AB  - BACKGROUND: As citizens, patients and family members are participating in 
      numerous and expanding roles in health system organizations, attention has turned 
      to evaluating these efforts. The context-specific nature of engagement requires 
      evaluation tools to be carefully designed for optimal use. We sought to address 
      this need by assessing the appropriateness and feasibility of a generic tool 
      across a range of health system organizations, engagement activities and patient 
      groups. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods implementation research design to study 
      the implementation of an engagement evaluation tool in seven health system 
      organizations in Ontario, Canada focusing on two key implementation outcome 
      variables: appropriateness and feasibility. Data were collected through 
      respondent feedback questions (binary and open-ended) at the end of the tool's 
      three questionnaires as well as interviews and debriefing discussions with 
      engagement professionals and patient partners from collaborating organizations. 
      RESULTS: The three questionnaires comprising the evaluation tool were 
      collectively administered 29 times to 405 respondents yielding a 52% response 
      rate (90% and 53% of respondents respectively assessed the survey's 
      appropriateness and feasibility [quantitatively or qualitatively]). The 
      questionnaires' basic properties were rated highly by all respondents. Concrete 
      suggestions were provided for improving the appropriateness and feasibility of 
      the questionnaires (or components within) for different engagement activity and 
      organization types, and for enhancing the timing of implementation. DISCUSSION 
      AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings offer guidance for health system 
      organizations and evaluators to support the optimal use of engagement evaluation 
      tools across a variety of health system settings, engagement activities and 
      respondent groups.

TI  - Supporting women at average risk to make informed decisions about mammography 
      when there is no "right" answer: a qualitative citizen deliberation study.
PG  - E730-E737
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20190102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women are encouraged to make informed choices about mammography 
      screening that align with their values and preferences, yet information materials 
      developed by screening programs rarely provide complete, balanced information 
      about screening. Through a series of deliberations with Ontario citizens, we 
      elicited perspectives on materials developed by screening programs to support 
      informed decision-making. METHODS: We held 4 deliberative engagement events with 
      citizens to discuss the current evidence about mammography and informed 
      decision-making for the general population (i.e., women not at high risk) in the 
      context of organized screening programs. Participants reviewed and provided 
      feedback on the educational materials currently produced by screening programs in 
      8 provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, 
      Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador) and 2 territories (Yukon Territory and 
      Northwest Territory) and identified the key features that should guide the design 
      of these materials to optimally support informed decision-making. RESULTS: In 
      general, participants viewed the educational materials as insufficient to support 
      informed decision-making. They identified the following key features of optimal 
      educational materials: they should be accessible, complete and accurate, and 
      provide information on both benefits and risks of screening in a comprehensive, 
      easy-to-understand manner. Information materials should evoke the trust of the 
      reader, and they should be consistent across Canada. INTERPRETATION: Canadian 
      women have insufficient access to reliable information sources and complete 
      evidence about mammography screening, and, without this information, they are 
      unable to make fully informed decisions. Canadian breast screening programs must 
      take steps to improve the information shared with women to support informed 
      decision-making that aligns with women's values and preferences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature that describes, applies, and 
      evaluates applications of health-system priority-setting frameworks in different 
      contexts. However, little explicit focus has been given to examining 
      operationalization of the stakeholder participation component of these 
      frameworks. The literature identifies the public as a stakeholder group and 
      recommends their participation when applying the frameworks. METHODS: We 
      conducted a scoping review to search the PubMed, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, Medline, and 
      PsycINFO databases for cases where priority-setting frameworks were applied 
      (2000-2017). We aimed to synthesize current literature to examine the degree to 
      which the public and vulnerable populations have been engaged through 
      applications of these frameworks FINDINGS: The following stakeholders commonly 
      participated: managers, administrators/coordinators, clinicians/physicians, 
      non-physician health care providers, health economists, academics/researchers, 
      experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers. Few papers reported on public 
      participation, and even fewer identified vulnerable groups that participate. 
      Stakeholders were most commonly reported to participate in identifying areas for 
      prioritization. CONCLUSIONS: While the frameworks were developed with stakeholder 
      participation in mind, in practice not all stakeholders are participating in 
      priority-setting processes as envisioned by the frameworks. The public and 
      vulnerable groups do not consistently participate, challenging the utility of the 
      participation component of frameworks in guiding stakeholder participation in 
      health-system priority setting. Frameworks can be more explicit about which 
      stakeholders should participate and detailing how their participation should be 
      operationalized.

AB  - The development of refugee health policies is significant, given the increased 
      volume of displaced persons seeking refuge in Canada and around the world. 
      Changes to the Canadian refugee health policy, known as the Interim Federal 
      Health Program (IFHP), limited healthcare access for refugees and refugee 
      claimants from 2012 to 2016. In this article, we present a policy analysis using 
      the case of the IFHP retrenchments to examine how political actors on opposing 
      sides of the issue defined the problem using different causal story mechanisms. 
      This analysis reveals that organized interests dramatically changed the problem 
      definition of the IFHP reforms. Following their use of causal stories in 
      redefining the problem, the courts declared that the reforms to refugee 
      healthcare were a form of cruel and unusual treatment. Understanding policy 
      strategies used by proponents of refugee healthcare coverage expansion is 
      important for countries responding to the current, enduring refugee crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in developed 
      public health systems remain understudied. Current approaches to HTA present a 
      variety of conceptual, methodological and practical problems in the context of 
      child health. This study explores the technical and sociopolitical determinants 
      of public funding decisions on paediatric drugs, through the analysis of 
      interviews with stakeholders involved in or impacted by HTA for child health 
      technologies at the provincial and national levels in Canada. METHODS: We 
      undertook in-depth interviews with a purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders 
      involved with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the 
      provincial (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Grounded theory methods were 
      employed to guide data collection and analysis. Theory on 'technology-as-policy' 
      and the sociopolitics of health technologies served as sensitizing concepts for 
      inductive data coding and analysis. Emergent themes informed the development of 
      conceptual and practical insights on social values and system dynamics related to 
      child HTA, of relevance to public policymaking on the coverage of health 
      technologies for children in Canada. RESULTS: Participant reflection on the 
      normative and systems dimensions of drug funding for children formed two broad 
      categories: HTA paradigms and sociopolitical context. Our analysis revealed 
      notable differences of context and substance related to child health technology 
      production, evaluation and use. These differences spanned the major phases of HTA 
      (from assembly to assessment to integration) and the surrounding sociopolitical 
      milieu (from markets to governance to politics). Careful analysis of these 
      differences sets in relief a number of substantive and procedural shortcomings of 
      current HTA paradigms in respect of child health. Our findings suggest a need to 
      rethink how HTA is structured and operationalized for child health technologies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Current approaches to health technology assessment are not well 
      calibrated to the realities of child health and illness. Our study presents a 
      nuanced and contextually grounded analysis of concepts instrumental to drug 
      funding decisions for children. The insights generated are directly applicable to 
      the Canadian and Ontario contexts, but also yield fundamental knowledge about HTA 
      for children that are germane to drug policy in other health systems.

TI  - Understanding health professional role integration in complex adaptive systems: a 
      multiple-case study of physician assistants in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 365

AB  - BACKGROUND: To meet the complex needs of healthcare delivery, the Ministry of 
      Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) introduced Physician Assistants (PAs) into the 
      Ontario health care system in 2006 with the goal of helping to increase access to 
      care, decrease wait times, improve continuity of care and provide a flexible 
      addition to the healthcare workforce. The characterization of healthcare 
      organizations as complex adaptive systems (CAS) may offer insight into the 
      relationships and interactions that optimize and restrict successful PA 
      integration. The aim of this study is to explore the integration of PAs across 
      multiple case settings and to understand the role of PAs within complex adaptive 
      systems. METHODS: An exploratory, multiple-case study was used to examine PA role 
      integration in four settings: family medicine, emergency medicine, general 
      surgery, and inpatient medicine. Interviews were conducted with 46 healthcare 
      providers and administrators across 13 hospitals and 6 family medicine clinics in 
      Ontario, Canada. Analysis was conducted in three phases including an inductive 
      thematic analysis within each of the four cases, a cross-case thematic analysis, 
      and a broader, deductive exploration of cross-case patterns pertaining to 
      specific complexity theory principles of interest. RESULTS: Forty-six health care 
      providers were interviewed across 19 different healthcare sites. Support for PA 
      contributions across various health care settings, the importance of role 
      awareness, supervisory relationship attributes, and role vulnerability are 
      interconnected and dynamic. Findings represent the experiences of PAs and other 
      healthcare providers, and demonstrate how the PAs willingness to work and ability 
      to build relationships allows for the establishment of interprofessional, 
      collaborative, and person-centered care. As a self-organizing agent in complex 
      adaptive systems (i.e., health organizations), PA role exploration revealed 
      patterns of team behavior, non-linear interconnections, open relationships, 
      dynamic systems, and the legacy of role implementation as defined by complexity 
      theory. CONCLUSIONS: By exploring the role of PAs across multiple sites, the 
      complexity theory lens concurrently fosters an awareness of emerging patterns, 
      relationships and non-linear interactions within the defined context of the 
      Ontario healthcare system. By establishing collaborative, interprofessional care 
      models in hospital and community settings, PAs are making a significant 
      contribution to Ontario healthcare settings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preferences of members of the public are recognized as important 
      inputs into health care priority-setting, though knowledge of such preferences is 
      scant. We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare 
      resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an 
      experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. 
      Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual 
      analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral 
      reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the 
      differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. 
      RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to 
      allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral 
      reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger 
      respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for 
      children. The top principles guiding participants' allocative decisions were 
      treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation 
      of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by 
      participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this 
      preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, 
      revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access. Definitions of value 
      in healthcare based on clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness may exclude moral 
      considerations that the public values, such as equality and humanitarianism, 
      highlighting opportunities to enrich healthcare priority-setting through public 
      engagement.

TI  - Understanding the Role of Values in Health Policy Decision-Making From the 
      Perspective of Policy-Makers and Stakeholders: A Multiple-Case Embedded Study in 
      Chile and Colombia.
PG  - 185-197
LID - 10.15171/ijhpm.2019.94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chile and Colombia are examples of Latin American countries with 
      health systems shaped by similar values. Recently, both countries have crafted 
      policies to regulate the participation of private for-profit insurance companies 
      in their health systems, but through very different mechanisms. This study asks: 
      what values are important in the decision-making processes that crafted these 
      policies? And how and why are they used? METHODS: An embedded multiple-case study 
      design was carried out for 2 specific decisions in each country: (1) in Chile, 
      the development of the Universal Plan of Explicit Entitlements -AUGE/GES - and 
      mandating universal coverage of treatments for high-cost diseases; and (2) in 
      Colombia, the declaration of health as a fundamental right and a mechanism to 
      explicitly exclude technologies that cannot be publicly funded. We interviewed 
      key informants involved in one or more of the decisions and/or in the policy 
      analysis and development process that contributed to the eventual decision. The 
      data analysis involved a constant comparative approach and thematic analysis for 
      each case study. RESULTS: From the 40 individuals who were invited, 28 key 
      informants participated. A tension between 2 important values was identified for 
      each decision (eg, solidarity vs. individualism for the AUGE/GES plan in Chile; 
      human dignity vs. sustainability for the declaration of the right to health in 
      Colombia). Policy-makers used values in the decisionmaking process to frame 
      problems in meaningful ways, to guide policy development, as a pragmatic 
      instrument to make decisions, and as a way to legitimize decisions. In Chile, 
      values such as individualism and free choice were incorporated in decision-making 
      because attaining private health insurance was seen as an indicator of improved 
      personal economic status. In Colombia, human dignity was incorporated as the core 
      value because the Constitutional Court asserted its importance in its use of 
      judicial activism as a check on the power of the executive and legislative 
      branches. CONCLUSION: There is an opportunity to open further exploration of the 
      role of values in different health decisions, political sectors besides health, 
      and even other jurisdictions.

TI  - Priority measures for publicly reporting primary care performance: Results of 
      public engagement through deliberative dialogues in 3 Canadian provinces.
PG  - 1213-1223
LID - 10.1111/hex.13100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While public reporting of hospital-based performance measurement is 
      commonplace, it has lagged in the primary care sector, especially in Canada. 
      Despite the increasing recognition of patients as active partners in the 
      health-care system, little is known about what information about primary care 
      performance is relevant to the Canadian public. We explored patient perspectives 
      and priorities for the public reporting of primary care performance measures. 
      METHODS: We conducted six deliberative dialogue sessions across three Canadian 
      provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia). Participants were asked to 
      rank and discuss the importance of collecting and reporting on specific 
      dimensions and indicators of primary care performance. We conducted a thematic 
      analysis of the data. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients participated in the dialogue 
      sessions. Measures of access to primary care providers, communication with 
      providers and continuity of information across all providers involved in a 
      patient's care were identified as the highest priority indicators of primary care 
      performance from a patient perspective. Several common measures of quality of 
      care, such as rates of cancer screening, were viewed as too patient dependent to 
      be used to evaluate the health system or primary care provider's performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that public reporting aimed at patient 
      audiences should focus on a nuanced measure of access, incorporation of context 
      reported alongside measurement that is for public audiences, clear reporting on 
      provider communication and a measure of information continuity. Participants 
      highlighted the importance the public places on their providers staying up to 
      date with advances in care.

TI  - Ethical and Social Values for Paediatric Health Technology Assessment and Drug 
      Policy.
PG  - 374-382
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in advanced 
      health systems remain understudied. In particular, the ethical and social values 
      dimensions of health technology assessment (HTA) and drug coverage decisions for 
      children have received almost no attention in research or policy. METHODS: To 
      elicit and understand the social values that influence decision-making for public 
      funding of paediatric drugs, we undertook a series of in-depth, semi-structured 
      interviews with a stratified purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders involved 
      with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the provincial 
      (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Constructivist grounded theory 
      methodology guided data collection and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our study 
      provides empirical evidence about the unique ethical and social values dimensions 
      of HTA for children, and describes a novel social values typology for paediatric 
      drug policy decision-making. Three principal categories of values emerged from 
      stakeholder reflections on HTA and drug policy-making for children: procedural 
      values, structural values, and sociocultural values. Key findings include the 
      importance of attention to the procedural legitimacy of HTA for children, with 
      emphasis on the inclusion of child health voices in processes of technology 
      appraisal and policy uptake; a role for HTA institutions to consider the equity 
      impacts of technologies, both in setting review priorities and in assessing the 
      value of technologies for public coverage; and the potential benefits of a 
      distinct national framework to guide drug policy for children. CONCLUSION: 
      Current approaches to HTA are not well designed for the realities of child health 
      and illness, nor the societal priorities regarding children that our study 
      identified. This research generates new knowledge to inform decision-making on 
      paediatric drugs by HTA institutions and government payers in Canada and other 
      publicly-funded health systems, through insights into the relevant social values 
      for child drug funding decisions from varied stakeholder groups.

TI  - A framework for explaining the role of values in health policy decision-making in 
      Latin America: a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1186/s12961-020-00584-y [doi]
LID - 100
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although values underpin the goals pursued in health systems, 
      including how health systems benefit the population, it is often not clear how 
      values are incorporated into policy decision-making about health systems. The 
      challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and 
      financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This 
      is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin 
      American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what 
      conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA 
      countries. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for 
      this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written 
      in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy 
      process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. 
      Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One 
      researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured 
      summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles 
      to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of 
      agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS: We 
      identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We 
      identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been 
      used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework 
      has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the 
      health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments 
      adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); 
      (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a 
      transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational 
      values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make 
      decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four 
      factors). CONCLUSIONS: It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different 
      social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about 
      health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate 
      values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the 
      achievement of policy goals in health system financing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      protocol was registered with PROSPERO, ID=CRD42017057049 .

TI  - The Moral Foundations of Child Health and Social Policies: A Critical 
      Interpretive Synthesis.
LID - 10.3390/children8010043 [doi]
LID - 43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allusions to the uniqueness and value of childhood abound in 
      academic, lay, and policy discourse. However, little clarity exists on the values 
      that guide child health and social policy-making. We review extant academic 
      literature on the normative dimensions of child health and social policy to 
      provide foundations for the development of child-focused public policies. 
      METHODS: We conducted a critical interpretive synthesis of academic literature on 
      the normative dimensions of child health and social policy-making. We employed a 
      social constructivist lens to interpret emergent themes. Political theory on the 
      social construction of target populations served as a bridge between sociologies 
      of childhood and public policy analysis. RESULTS: Our database searches returned 
      14,658 unique articles; full text review yielded 72 relevant articles. Purposive 
      sampling of relevant literature complemented our electronic searches, adding 51 
      original articles, for a total of 123 articles. Our analysis of the literature 
      reveals three central themes: potential, rights, and risk. These themes retain 
      relevance in diverse policy domains. A core set of foundational concepts also 
      cuts across disciplines: well-being, participation, and best interests of the 
      child inform debate on the moral and legal dimensions of a gamut of child social 
      policies. Finally, a meta-theme of embedding encompasses the pervasive issue of a 
      child's place, in the family and in society, which is at the heart of much social 
      theory and applied analysis on children and childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Foundational 
      understanding of the moral language and dominant policy frames applied to 
      children can enrich analyses of social policies for children. Most societies 
      paint children as potent, vulnerable, entitled, and embedded. It is the admixture 
      of these elements in particular policy spheres, across distinct places and times, 
      that often determines the form of a given policy and societal reactions to it. 
      Subsequent work in this area will need to detail the degree and impact of 
      variance in the values mix attached to children across sociocultural contexts and 
      investigate tensions between what are and what ought to be the values that guide 
      social policy development for children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The practice of public and patient engagement (PPE) in health 
      technology assessment (HTA) has spread worldwide, yet gaps in knowledge remain. 
      We carried out an institutional ethnography of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and 
      Technologies in Health (CADTH) public and patient involvement in HTA. METHODS: 
      The research took place over 15 months and included observational work in the 
      institutional settings, text review, and interviews with individuals working for 
      or involved with the agency. RESULTS: We found that despite demonstrated 
      commitment to PPE, organizational history, governance structure, and practices 
      were impediments to a unified approach to PPE. Unclear role descriptions for 
      committee members and differences in philosophy and priority given to PPE across 
      the organization presented challenges to effective participation. The high degree 
      of value given to evidence-based principles at times conflicted with meaningful 
      integration of patient input. A lack of clear goals and processes, roles, and 
      differential treatment of evidence in PPE served to minimize the importance of 
      patient experiences and to displace their validity. An acknowledgment of 
      conflicts between multiple epistemic traditions at work within HTA activities may 
      strengthen organizational approaches to PPE. CONCLUSION: HTA organizations can 
      learn from this study by reflecting on the challenges described and the 
      recommendations offered to address them. We suggest solidifying CADTH's 
      commitment to PPE with clear agency-wide roles and direction, values, and 
      outcomes, a comprehensive framework, and policy and procedures. An acknowledgment 
      of diverse epistemic traditions, as well as leadership and expertise in PPE, will 
      strengthen CADTH's PPE activities and sustain its leadership position in the HTA 
      field.

TI  - Barriers to Equitable Public Participation in Health-System Priority Setting 
      Within the Context of Decentralization: The Case of Vulnerable Women in a Ugandan 
      District.
PG  - 1047-1057
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decentralization of healthcare decision-making in Uganda led to the 
      promotion of public participation. To facilitate this, participatory structures 
      have been developed at sub-national levels. However, the degree to which the 
      participation structures have contributed to improving the participation of 
      vulnerable populations, specifically vulnerable women, remains unclear. We aim to 
      understand whether and how vulnerable women participate in health-system priority 
      setting; identify any barriers to vulnerable women's participation; and to 
      establish how the barriers to vulnerable women's participation can be addressed. 
      METHODS: We used a qualitative description study design involving interviews with 
      district decision-makers (n=12), sub-county leaders (n=10), and vulnerable women 
      (n=35) living in Tororo District, Uganda. Data was collected between May and June 
      2017. The analysis was conducting using an editing analysis style. RESULTS: The 
      vulnerable women expressed interest in participating in priority setting, 
      believing they would make valuable contributions. However, both decision-makers 
      and vulnerable women reported that vulnerable women did not consistently 
      participate in decision-making, despite participatory structures that were 
      instituted through decentralization. There are financial (transportation and lack 
      of incentives), biomedical (illness/disability and menstruation), knowledge-based 
      (lack of knowledge and/or information about participation), motivational 
      (perceived disinterest, lack of feedback, and competing needs), socio-cultural 
      (lack of decision-making power), and structural (hunger and poverty) barriers 
      which hamper vulnerable women's participation. CONCLUSION: The identified 
      barriers hinder vulnerable women's participation in health-system priority 
      setting. Some of the barriers could be addressed through the existing 
      decentralization participatory structures. Respondents made both short-term, 
      feasible recommendations and more systemic, ideational recommendations to improve 
      vulnerable women's participation. Integrating the vulnerable women's creative and 
      feasible ideas to enhance their participation in health-system decision-making 
      should be prioritized.

      research: study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement (PPE) in research is growing 
      internationally, and with it, the interest for its evaluation. In Canada, the 
      Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research has generated national momentum and 
      opportunities for greater PPE in research and health-system transformation. As is 
      the case with most countries, the Canadian research community lacks a common 
      evaluation framework for PPE, thus limiting our capacity to ensure integrity 
      between principles and practices, learn across projects, identify common areas 
      for improvement, and assess the impacts of engagement. OBJECTIVE: This project 
      aims to build a national adaptable framework for the evaluation of PPE in 
      research, by: 1. Building consensus on common evaluation criteria and indicators 
      for PPE in research; 2. Defining recommendations to implement and adapt the 
      framework to specific populations. METHODS: Using a collaborative action-research 
      approach, a national coalition of patient-oriented research leaders, (patient and 
      community partners, engagement practitioners, researchers and health system 
      leaders) will co-design the evaluation framework. We will develop core evaluation 
      domains of the logic model by conducting a series of virtual consensus meetings 
      using a nominal group technique with 50 patient partners and engagement 
      practitioners, identified through 18 national research organizations. We will 
      then conduct two Delphi rounds to prioritize process and impact indicators with 
      200 participants purposely recruited to include respondents from seldom-heard 
      groups. Six expert working groups will define recommendations to implement and 
      adapt the framework to research with specific populations, including Indigenous 
      communities, immigrants, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, 
      caregivers, and people with low literacy. Each step of framework development will 
      be guided by an equity, diversity and inclusion approach in an effort to ensure 
      that the participants engaged, the content produced, and the adaptation 
      strategies proposed are relevant to diverse PPE. DISCUSSION: The potential 
      contributions of this project are threefold: 1) support a national learning 
      environment for engagement by offering a common blueprint for collaborative 
      evaluation to the Canadian research community; 2) inform the international 
      research community on potential (virtual) methodologies to build national 
      consensus on common engagement evaluation frameworks; and 3) illustrate a shared 
      attempt to engage patients and researchers in a strategic national initiative to 
      strengthen evaluation capacity for PPE.

      contradictions.
PG  - 177-94
LID - 10.1108/JHOM-07-2020-0292 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this paper, we contribute to the theorizing of patient involvement in 
      organizational improvement by exploring concepts of "learning from patients" as 
      mechanisms of organizational change. Using the concept of metaphor as a 
      theoretical bridge, we analyse interview data (n = 20) from participants in 
      patient engagement activities from two case study organizations in Ontario, 
      Canada. Inspired by classic organizational scholars, we ask "what is the 
      organization that it might learn from patients?" DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: 
      Patient involvement activities are used as part of quality improvement efforts in 
      healthcare organizations worldwide. One fundamental assumption underpinning this 
      activity is the notion that organizations must "learn from patients" in order to 
      enact positive organizational change. Despite this emphasis on learning, there is 
      a paucity of research that theorizes learning or connects concepts of learning to 
      organizational change within the domain of patient involvement. FINDINGS: Through 
      our analysis, we interpret a range of metaphors of the organization, including 
      organizations as (1) power and politics, (2) systems and (3) narratives. Through 
      these metaphors, we display a range of possibilities for interpreting how 
      organizations might learn from patients and associated implications for 
      organizational change. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This analysis has implications for how 
      the framing of the organization matters for concepts of learning in patient 
      engagement activities and how misalignments might stymie engagement efforts. We 
      argue that the concept and commitment to "learning from patients" would be 
      enriched by further engagement with the sociology of knowledge and critical 
      concepts from theories of organizational learning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigate whether older adults who were newly diagnosed with 
      dementia (severity unspecified) and resided in an assisted living facility that 
      offered a dementia care program had a lower rate of transition to a nursing home, 
      compared to those who resided in an assisted living facility without such a 
      program. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Linked, person-level health system administrative data on older 
      adults who were newly diagnosed with dementia and resided in an assisted living 
      facility in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2019 (n = 977). METHODS: Access to a 
      dementia care program in an assisted living facility (n = 57) was examined. 
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors 
      clustered on the assisted living facility was used to model the time to 
      transition to a nursing home from the new dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 
      11.8 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program, compared 
      with 20.5 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults 
      who resided in an assisted living facility without a dementia care program. After 
      adjustment for relevant characteristics at baseline, older adults who resided in 
      an assisted living facility with a dementia care program had a 40% lower rate of 
      transition to a nursing home (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 
      0.81), compared with those in an assisted living facility without such a program 
      at any point during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The rate 
      of transition to a nursing home was significantly lower among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility that offered a dementia care program. 
      These findings support the expansion of dementia care programs in assisted living 
      facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many residents of assisted living facilities live with dementia, but 
      little is known about the characteristics of assisted living facilities that 
      provide specialized care for older adults who live with dementia. In this study, 
      we identify the characteristics of assisted living facilities that offer a 
      dementia care program, compared to those that do not offer such a program. 
      METHODS: We conducted a population-level cross-sectional study on all licensed 
      assisted living facilities in Ontario, Canada in 2018 (n = 738). Facility-level 
      characteristics (e.g., resident and suite capacities, etc.) and the provision of 
      the other 12 provincially regulated care services (e.g., pharmacist and medical 
      services, skin and wound care, etc.) attributed to assisted living facilities 
      were examined. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was 
      used to model the characteristics of assisted living facilities associated with 
      the provision of a dementia care program. RESULTS: There were 123 assisted living 
      facilities that offered a dementia care program (16.7% versus 83.3% no dementia 
      care). Nearly half of these facilities had a resident capacity exceeding 140 
      older adults (44.7% versus 21.6% no dementia care) and more than 115 suites 
      (46.3% versus 20.8% no dementia care). All assisted living facilities that 
      offered a dementia care program also offered nursing services, meals, assistance 
      with bathing and hygiene, and administered medications. After adjustment for 
      facility characteristics and other provincially regulated care services, the 
      prevalence of a dementia care program was nearly three times greater in assisted 
      living facilities that offered assistance with feeding (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 
      2.91, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.98 to 4.29), and almost twice as great among 
      assisted living facilities that offered medical services (PR 1.78, 95% CI 1.00 to 
      3.17), compared to those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: A dementia care program was 
      more prevalent in assisted living facilities that housed many older adults, had 
      many suites, and offered at least five of the other 12 regulated care services. 
      Our findings deepen the understanding of specialized care for dementia in 
      assisted living facilities.

TI  - Priority setting and equity in COVID-19 pandemic plans: a comparative analysis of 
      18 African countries.
PG  - 297-309
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czab113 [doi]
AB  - Priority setting represents an even bigger challenge during public health 
      emergencies than routine times. This is because such emergencies compete with 
      routine programmes for the available health resources, strain health systems and 
      shift health-care attention and resources towards containing the spread of the 
      epidemic and treating those that fall seriously ill. This paper is part of a 
      larger global study, the aim of which is to evaluate the degree to which national 
      COVID-19 preparedness and response plans incorporated priority setting concepts. 
      It provides important insights into what and how priority decisions were made in 
      the context of a pandemic. Specifically, with a focus on a sample of 18 African 
      countries' pandemic plans, the paper aims to: (1) explore the degree to which the 
      documented priority setting processes adhere to established quality indicators of 
      effective priority setting and (2) examine if there is a relationship between the 
      number of quality indicators present in the pandemic plans and the country's 
      economic context, health system and prior experiences with disease outbreaks. All 
      the reviewed plans contained some aspects of expected priority setting processes 
      but none of the national plans addressed all quality parameters. Most of the 
      parameters were mentioned by less than 10 of the 18 country plans reviewed, and 
      several plans identified one or two aspects of fair priority setting processes. 
      Very few plans identified equity as a criterion for priority setting. Since the 
      parameters are relevant to the quality of priority setting that is implemented 
      during public health emergencies and most of the countries have pre-existing 
      pandemic plans; it would be advisable that, for the future (if not already 
      happening), countries consider priority setting as a critical part of their 
      routine health emergency and disease outbreak plans. Such an approach would 
      ensure that priority setting is integral to pandemic planning, response and 
      recovery.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on patient engagement in the health system: Results from a 
      Pan-Canadian survey of patient, family and caregiver partners.
PG  - 744-753
LID - 10.1111/hex.13421 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of the 
      health system. Little is known about how the activities and experiences of 
      patient, family and caregiver partners, as a large group across a variety of 
      settings within the health system, changed due to the substantial health system 
      shifts catalysed by the pandemic. This paper reports on the results of a survey 
      that included questions about this topic. METHODS: Canadian patient, family and 
      caregiver partners were invited to participate in an online anonymous survey in 
      the Fall of 2020. A virtual snowballing approach to recruitment was used. Survey 
      invitations were shared on social media and emailed to health system and 
      governmental organizations with the request that they share the survey with 
      patient partners. This paper focuses on responses to two questions related to 
      patient partner experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 
      questions were completed by 533 respondents. Over three quarters of respondents 
      (77.9%, n = 415) indicated their patient engagement activities had been impacted 
      by COVID-19. The majority (62.5%, n = 230) experienced at least a temporary or 
      partial reduction in their patient engagement activities. Some respondents did 
      see increases in their patient engagement activities (11.4%, n = 42). Many 
      respondents provided insights into their experience with virtual platforms for 
      engagement (n = 194), most expressed negative or mixed experiences with this 
      shift. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of Canadian patient, family 
      and caregiver partners' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their 
      engagement activities. Understanding how engagement unfolded during a crisis is 
      critical for our future planning if patient engagement is to be fully integrated 
      into the health system. Identifying how patient partners were engaged and not 
      engaged during this time period, as well as the benefits and challenges of 
      virtual engagement opportunities, offers instructive lessons for sustaining 
      patient engagement, including the supports needed to engage with a more diverse 
      set of patient, family and caregiver partners. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient 
      partners were important members of the Canadian Patient Partner Study research 
      team. They were engaged from the outset, participating in all stages of the 
      research project. Additional patient partners were engaged to develop and pilot 
      test the survey, and all survey respondents were patient, family or caregiver 
      partners. The manuscript is coauthored by two patient partners.

TI  - Rates of health services use among residents of retirement homes in Ontario: a 
      population-based cohort study.
PG  - E730-E738
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.211883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because there are no standardized reporting systems specific to 
      residents of retirement homes in North America, little is known about the health 
      of this distinct population of older adults. We evaluated rates of health 
      services use by residents of retirement homes relative to those of residents of 
      long-term care homes and other populations of older adults. METHODS: We conducted 
      a retrospective cohort study using population health administrative data from 
      2018 on adults 65 years or older in Ontario. We matched the postal codes of 
      individuals to those of licensed retirement homes to identify residents of 
      retirement homes. Outcomes included rates of hospital-based care and physician 
      visits. RESULTS: We identified 54 733 residents of 757 retirement homes (mean age 
      86.7 years, 69.0% female) and 2 354 385 residents of other settings. Compared to 
      residents of long-term care homes, residents of retirement homes had 
      significantly higher rates per 1000 person months of emergency department visits 
      (10.62 v. 4.48, adjusted relative rate [RR] 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      2.55 to 2.67), hospital admissions (5.42 v. 2.08, adjusted RR 2.77, 95% CI 2.71 
      to 2.82), alternate level of care (ALC) days (6.01 v. 2.96, adjusted RR 1.51, 95% 
      CI 1.48 to 1.54), and specialist physician visits (6.27 v. 3.21, adjusted RR 
      1.64, 95% CI 1.61 to 1.68), but a significantly lower rate of primary care visits 
      (16.71 v. 108.47, adjusted RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.14). INTERPRETATION: 
      Residents of retirement homes are a distinct population with higher rates of 
      hospital-based care. Our findings can help to inform policy debates about the 
      need for more coordinated primary and supportive health care in privately 
      operated congregate care homes.

TI  - Designing and Implementing Deliberative Processes for Health Technology 
      Assessment: A Good Practices Report of a Joint HTAi/ISPOR Task Force.
PG  - e37

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Deliberative processes for health technology assessment (HTA) are 
      intended to facilitate participatory decision making, using discussion and open 
      dialogue between stakeholders. Increasing attention is being given to 
      deliberative processes, but guidance is lacking for those who wish to design or 
      use them. Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi) and ISPOR-The 
      Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research initiated a joint 
      Task Force to address this gap. METHODS: The joint Task Force consisted of 
      fifteen members with different backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise relevant 
      to the field. It developed guidance and a checklist for deliberative processes 
      for HTA. The guidance builds upon the few, existing initiatives in the field, as 
      well as input from the HTA community following an established consultation plan. 
      In addition, the guidance was subject to two rounds of peer review. RESULTS: A 
      deliberative process for HTA consists of procedures, activities, and events that 
      support the informed and critical examination of an issue and the weighing of 
      arguments and evidence to guide a subsequent decision. Guidance and an 
      accompanying checklist are provided for (i) developing the governance and 
      structure of an HTA program and (ii) informing how the various stages of an HTA 
      process might be managed using deliberation. CONCLUSIONS: The guidance and the 
      checklist contain a series of questions, grouped by six phases of a model 
      deliberative process. They are offered as practical tools for those wishing to 
      establish or improve deliberative processes for HTA that are fit for local 
      contexts. The tools can also be used for independent scrutiny of deliberative 
      processes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we (1) identify the terms used to describe the 
      assisted living sector and the legislation governing operation in all Canadian 
      provinces and territories; (2) identify the cost estimates associated with 
      residency in these homes; and (3) quantify the growth of the sector. DESIGN: 
      Environmental scan. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Internet searches of Canadian 
      provincial and territorial government websites and professional associations were 
      conducted in 2021 to retrieve publicly accessible sources related to the assisted 
      living sector. METHODS: We synthesized data that identified the terms used to 
      describe the sector in all provinces and territories, the legislation governing 
      operation, financing, median fees per month for care, and growth of the sector 
      from 2012 to 2020. Counts and proportions were calculated for some extracted 
      variables. All data were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: The terms used to 
      describe the assisted living sector varied across Canada. The terms "assisted 
      living," "retirement homes," and "supportive living" were prevalent. Ontario was 
      the only province to regulate the sector through an independent, not-for-profit 
      organization. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta had some of the highest 
      median fees for room, board, and care per month (range: $1873 to $6726). The 
      licensed assisted living sector in Ontario doubled in size (768 in 2020 vs 383 in 
      2012), and there was a threefold increase in the number of corporate-owned chain 
      assisted living facilities (465 in 2020 vs 142 in 2012). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The rapid growth of the assisted living sector that is primarily 
      financed through out-of-pocket payments may indicate a rise in a two-tier system 
      of housing and health care for older adults. Policymakers need better mechanisms, 
      such as standardized reporting systems and assessments, to understand the needs 
      of older adults who reside in assisted living facilities and inform the need for 
      sector regulation and oversight.

TI  - Understanding the Conceptualization and Operationalization of Trauma-Informed 
      Care Within and Across Systems: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis.
PG  - 785-853
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12579 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points In order to achieve successful operationalization of 
      trauma-informed care (TIC), TIC policies must include conceptual clarity 
      regarding the definition of both trauma and TIC. Furthermore, TIC requires clear 
      and cohesive policies that address operational factors such as clearly delineated 
      roles of service providers, protocol for positive trauma screens, necessary 
      financial infrastructure, and mechanisms of intersectoral collaboration. 
      Additionally, policy procedures need to be considered for how TIC is provided at 
      the program and service level as well as what TIC means at the organizational, 
      system, and intersectoral level. CONTEXT: Increased recognition of the 
      epidemiology of trauma and its impact on individuals within and across human 
      service delivery systems has contributed to the development of trauma-informed 
      care (TIC). How TIC can be conceptualized and implemented, however, remains 
      unclear. This study seeks to review and analyze the TIC literature from within 
      and across systems of care and to generate a conceptual framework regarding TIC. 
      METHODS: Our study followed a critical interpretive synthesis methodology. We 
      searched multiple databases (Campbell Collaboration, Econlit, Health Systems 
      Evidence, Embase, ERIC, HealthSTAR, IPSA, JSTOR, Medline, PsychINFO, Social 
      Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science),as well as 
      relevant gray literature and information-rich websites. We used a coding tool, 
      adapted to the TIC literature, for data extraction. FINDINGS: Electronic database 
      searches yielded 2,439 results and after inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
      applied, a purposive sample of 98 information-rich articles was generated. 
      Conceptual clarity and definitional understanding of TIC is lacking in the 
      literature, which has led to poor operationalization of TIC. Additionally, 
      infrastructural and ideological barriers, such as insufficient funding and 
      service provider "buy-in," have hindered TIC implementation. The resulting 
      conceptual framework defines trauma and depicts critical elements of vertical 
      TIC, including the bidirectional relationship between the trauma-affected 
      individual and the system, and horizontal TIC, which requires intersectoral 
      collaboration, an established referral network, and standardized TIC language. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Successful operationalization of TIC requires policies that address 
      current gaps in systems arrangements, such as the lack of funding structures for 
      TIC, and political factors, such as the role of policy legacies. The emergent 
      conceptual framework acknowledges critical factors affecting operationalization.

TI  - Access to novel drugs and therapeutics for children and youth: Eliciting 
      citizens' values to inform public funding decisions.
PG  - 715-727

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The unique evidentiary, economic and ethical challenges associated 
      with health technology assessment (HTA) of precision therapies limit access to 
      novel drugs and therapeutics for children and youth, for whom such challenges are 
      amplified. We elicited citizens' perspectives about values-based criteria 
      relevant to the assessment of paediatric precision therapies to inform the 
      development of a child-tailored HTA framework. METHODS: We held four citizen 
      panels virtually in May-June 2021, informed by a plain-language citizen brief 
      summarizing global and local evidence about the challenges, policy and 
      programmatic options and implementation strategies related to enhancing access to 
      precision therapies for Canadian children and youth. Panellists were recruited 
      through a nationally representative database, medical/patient networks and social 
      media. We inductively coded and thematically analysed panel transcripts to 
      generate themes and identify priority values. RESULTS: The perspectives of 
      panellists (n = 45) coalesced into four overlapping themes, with attendant 
      subthemes, relevant to a child-tailored HTA framework: (1) Childhood 
      Distinctions: vulnerability, 'fair innings', future potential, family impacts; 
      (2) Voice: agency of children and youth; lived versus no lived experience; (3) 
      One versus Many: disease severity, rarity, equity, unmet need and (4) Health 
      System Governance: funding, implementation inequities, effectiveness and safety. 
      Participants broadly agreed that childhood distinctions, particularly family 
      impacts, justify child-tailored HTA. Dissent arose over whose voice should inform 
      HTA and how such perspectives are best incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens can 
      offer unique insights into criteria relevant to the development or revision of 
      HTA frameworks to capture holistic, societally responsive dimensions of value 
      attached to unique contexts or populations, including children. Balancing the 
      hopes and expectations of patients and caregivers for access to expensive but 
      potential life-altering therapies against the opportunity costs borne by 
      encompassing health systems is a fundamental challenge that will require rigorous 
      methods to elicit, weigh and reconcile varied views. PATIENT OR PUBLIC 
      CONTRIBUTION: A patient advocate served on the steering committee of this study 
      and co-authored this article. Key informants for the Citizen Brief included 
      patient advocates and caregivers; a separate patient advocate reviewed the Brief 
      before dissemination. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the 
      general public and caregivers of children, with written consent.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the sociodemographic characteristics, activities, 
      motivations, experiences, skills and challenges of patient partners working 
      across multiple health system settings in Canada. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional 
      survey of self-identified patient partners. SETTING: Patient partners in multiple 
      jurisdictions and health system organisations. PARTICIPANTS: 603 patient partners 
      who had drawn on their experiences with the health system as a patient, family 
      member or informal caregiver to try to improve it in some way, through their 
      involvement in the activities of a group, organisation or government. RESULTS: 
      Survey respondents predominantly identified as female (76.6%), white (84%) and 
      university educated (70.2%) but were a heterogeneous group in the scope 
      (activities and organisations), intensity (number of hours) and longevity (number 
      of years) of their role. Primary motivations for becoming a patient partner were 
      the desire to improve the health system based on either a negative (36.2%) or 
      positive (23.3%) experience. Respondents reported feeling enthusiastic (83.6%), 
      valued (76.9%) and needed (63.3%) always or most of the time; just under half 
      felt they had always or often been adequately compensated in their role. 
      Knowledge of the health system and the organisation they partner with are key 
      skills needed. Two-thirds faced barriers in their role with over half identifying 
      power imbalances. Less than half were able to see how their input was reflected 
      in decisions or changes always or most of the time, and 40.3% had thought about 
      quitting. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first of its kind to examine at a 
      population level, the characteristics, experiences and dynamics of a large sample 
      of self-identified patient partners. Patient partners in this sample are a 
      sociodemographically homogenous group, yet heterogeneous in the scope, intensity 
      and longevity of roles. Our findings provide key insights at a critical time, to 
      inform the future of patient partnership in health systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the sharp increase in the involvement of patients (including 
      family and informal caregivers) as active participants, collaborators, advisors 
      and decision-makers in health systems, a new role has emerged: the patient 
      partner. The role of patient partner differs from other forms of patient 
      engagement in its longitudinal and bidirectional nature. This systematic review 
      describes extant work on how patient partners are conceptualized and engaged in 
      health systems. In doing so, it furthers the understanding of the role and 
      activities of patient partners, and best practices for future patient partnership 
      activities. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed 
      literature published in English or French that describes patient partner roles 
      between 2000 and 2021 in any country or sector of the health system. We used a 
      broad search strategy to capture descriptions of longitudinal patient engagement 
      that may not have used words such as "partner" or "advisor". RESULTS: A total of 
      506 eligible papers were identified, representing patient partnership activities 
      in mostly high-income countries. These studies overwhelmingly described patient 
      partnership in health research. We identified clusters of literature about 
      patient partnership in cancer and mental health. The literature is saturated with 
      single-site descriptive studies of patient partnership on individual projects or 
      initiatives. There is a lack of work synthesizing impacts, facilitating factors 
      and outcomes of patient partnership in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: There is not yet 
      a consolidated understanding of the role, activities or impacts of patient 
      partners. Advancement of the literature has been stymied by a lack of 
      consistently used terminology. The literature is ready to move beyond single-site 
      descriptions, and synthesis of existing pockets of high-quality theoretical work 
      will be essential to this evolution.

TI  - Development of the Engage with Impact Toolkit: A comprehensive resource to 
      support the evaluation of patient, family and caregiver engagement in health 
      systems.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1111/hex.13742 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent shifts in the patient, family and caregiver engagement field 
      have focused greater attention on measurement and evaluation, including the 
      impacts of engagement efforts. Current evaluation tools offer limited support to 
      organizations seeking to reorient their efforts in this way. We addressed this 
      gap through the development of an impact measurement framework and accompanying 
      evaluation toolkit-the Engage with Impact Toolkit. METHODS: The measurement 
      framework and toolkit were co-designed with the Evaluating Patient Engagement 
      Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of patient, family and caregiver 
      partners, engagement specialists, researchers and government personnel. Project 
      activities occurred over four phases: (1) project scoping and literature review; 
      (2) modified concept mapping; (3) working group deliberations and (4) toolkit web 
      design. RESULTS: The project scope was to develop a measurement framework and an 
      evaluation toolkit for patient engagement in health systems that were practical, 
      accessible, menu-driven and aligned with current system priorities. Concept 
      mapping yielded 237 impact statements that were sorted, discussed and combined 
      into 81 unique items. A shorter list of 50 items (rated 8.0 or higher out of 10) 
      was further consolidated to generate a final list of 35 items mapped across 8 
      conceptual domains of impact: (1) knowledge and skills; (2) confidence and trust; 
      (3) equity and inclusivity; (4) priorities and decisions; (5) effectiveness and 
      efficiency; (6) patient-centredness; (7) culture change and (8) patient outcomes 
      and experience. Working Group members rated the final list for importance (1-5) 
      and identified a core set of 33 items (one for each of the 8 domains and 25 
      supplementary items). Two domains (priorities and decisions; and culture change) 
      yielded the highest overall importance ratings (4.8). A web-based toolkit 
      (www.evaluateengagement.ca) hosts the measurement framework and related 
      evaluation supports. CONCLUSION: The Engage with Impact Toolkit builds on 
      existing engagement evaluation tools but brings a more explicit focus to 
      supporting organizations to assess the impacts of their engagement work. PATIENT 
      CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver partners led the early 
      conceptualization of this work and were involved at all stages and in all aspects

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is a pan-Canadian research network 
      focused on innovating and improving the quality and delivery of pain prevention, 
      assessment, management and research for all Canadians. An important focus of the 
      CPN is to work in collaboration with patient partners. Patient partners, 
      researchers and clinicians work together in all aspects of the research network 
      including on funded research projects and in the governance of the Network. Given 
      this focus, the CPN identified the importance of evaluating their patient 
      engagement work to understand its functioning and impact. METHODS: The objective 
      of this exploratory evaluation case study was to understand the impacts of 
      patient engagement on the CPN. The CPN worked with an external evaluation team 
      which established an arms-length approach to the evaluation. Interviews were 
      conducted with CPN members, including patient partners, leadership, funded 
      researchers and committee co-chairs, at three discrete time points to trace the 
      evolution of the patient engagement program within the Network. Key Network 
      documents were also collected and reviewed. Data were analyzed following each set 
      of interviews using content analysis guided by the principles of constant 
      comparison and qualitative description. A final round of analysis was conducted 
      using the Engage with Impact Toolkit, an impact measurement framework, to 
      identify impacts of engagement. RESULTS: Impacts of patient engagement were 
      identified at the individual, network, funded research project and research 
      community levels. These impacts were observed in the following areas: (1) 
      building community; (2) developing knowledge, skills and resources; (3) 
      increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and decisions; (5) enabling 
      additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; and, (7) coping with 
      experiences of living with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: While not without 
      challenges, the patient engagement efforts of the CPN demonstrates the impact 
      engaging patient partners can have on a national research network and related 
      policy activities. Understanding the approaches to, and impacts of, patient 
      engagement on health research networks can illuminate the value of having patient 
      partners engaged in all aspects of a research network and should serve as 
      encouragement to others who look to take on similar work.

OAB - The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is one of a group of research networks that was 
      funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to support 
      patient-oriented research in chronic diseases. From the beginning of its work, 
      the CPN has included patients as partners. Patient partners are co-chairs of all 
      Network governance committees, funded projects are required to include patient 
      partners in their work and there is a committee dedicated to engagement, the 
      Patient Engagement (PE) committee. The PE Committee determined that it was 
      important to evaluate how the CPN was engaging with patient partners and 
      collaborated with the Public and Patient Engagement Collaborative (PPEC) to 
      evaluate this work. The PPEC, along with members of the PE Committee, identified 
      understanding the impact of patient engagement as an important part of the 
      evaluation. This paper provides a description of the impacts of patient 
      engagement on the people who were involved in the CPN, on the CPN's work and way 
      of being, and on the broader pain research community. Based on the results from 
      three sets of interviews and review of Network documents, we share impacts 
      identified in seven areas: (1) building community; (2) developing knowledge, 
      skills and resources; (3) increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and 
      decisions; (5) enabling additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; 
      and, (7) coping with experiences of living with chronic pain. This research shows 
      us the impact that engaging patient partners can have on a national research 
      network, and the areas where greater focus could, perhaps, lead to even greater 
      impacts in future networks.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of engaging older adults and service providers as research 
      partners in the co-design of a community mobility-promoting program: a mixed 
      methods developmental evaluation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly researchers are partnering with citizens and communities 
      in research; less is known about research impacts of this engagement. EMBOLDEN is 
      an evidence-informed, mobility-promoting intervention for older adults 
      co-designed by a 26-person Strategic Guiding Council (SGC) of health/social 
      service providers and older adult citizens. This study evaluated research 
      partners' perceptions of engagement strategies, the engagement context, 
      strengths, areas for improvement, as well as the impacts of the guiding council 
      on older-adult identified priority areas. METHODS: This study was guided by 
      developmental evaluation, working in partnership with four older adult SGC 
      members who helped to set evaluation priorities, decide methods, and adapt 
      patient-centred evaluation tools. Data sources included a questionnaire, focus 
      groups and document analysis of meeting notes from 16 SGC meetings that took 
      place between December 2019 and February 2022. A thematic approach to analysis 
      guided the coding of focus group transcripts and SGC meeting notes. Convergent 
      mixed methods guided the integration and presentation of qualitative and 
      quantitative data sources in a joint display of evaluation results. RESULTS: Of 
      26 SGC members, nine completed the evaluation squestionnaire, and five 
      participated in focus groups. Around two thirds of the SGC commonly attended each 
      meeting. EMBOLDEN's SGC was structured to include a diverse group (across gender, 
      ethnicity and discipline) of older adults and service providers, which was 
      perceived as a strength. Engagement processes were perceived as inclusive and 
      well-facilitated, which stimulated discussion at meetings. Advantages and 
      disadvantages of engaging with the SGC virtually, as compared to in-person (as 
      was the case for the first 3 SGC meetings) were also discussed. Impacts of the 
      SGC were identified across preparatory, execution phase and translational stages 
      of research. Impacts of SGC involvement on members were also described. 
      CONCLUSION: Older adult research partners played an important role designing, 
      implementing, and evaluating co-design approaches in this study. Older adults and 
      service providers can make important contributions to the design, delivery and 
      sharing results of health research through their lived expertise and connections 
      to community. This project contributes to the growing field of citizen and 
      community engagement in research by offering a participatory approach to 
      engagement evaluation that considers diversity, satisfaction, and impact.

OAB - It is becoming common for researchers to ask patients and caregivers to become 
      involved with their studies as partners. By partnering with people who have 
      first-hand experience with a condition, researchers hope their studies will be 
      more relevant, run efficiently and have more impact than studies designed by 
      researchers alone. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant 
      increase in the number of published papers that involve patients and caregivers, 
      but few papers mention what changed because of this involvement. Researchers need 
      to know the best ways to involve patients and caregivers and the impact of doing 
      so.This study aimed to find out how a council of older adults (OAs) and service 
      providers (SPs) impacted a study about collaboratively designing and testing a 
      mobility intervention. This study aimed to find out how council members felt 
      about their involvement in this study, by asking them what went well and what 
      could have been improved.This study used a questionnaire, focus groups and 
      analyzed council meeting notes to inform this study. Four OA council members 
      helped design the study, decide research methods, and adapt wording of questions 
      (focus groups, questionnaire). Between 19% and 35% of council members completed 
      evaluation activities. They felt the study strengths were the diversity of the 
      council, and a welcoming environment for discussion. The council impacted how the 
      study was designed, carried out and how results were shared. Results from this 
      study can improve patient partnership engagement, experiences, and impacts in 
      future studies.

TI  - A global comparative analysis of the the inclusion of priority setting in 
      national COVID-19 pandemic plans: A reflection on the methods and the 
      accessibility of the plans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the swift governments' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      there remains a paucity of literature assessing the degree to which; priority 
      setting (PS) was included in the pandemic plans and the pandemic plans were 
      publicly accessible. This paper reflects on the methods employed in a global 
      comparative analysis of the degree to which countries integrated PS into their 
      COVID-19 pandemic plans based on Kapiriri & Martin's framework. We also assessed 
      if the accessibility of the plans was related to the country's transparency 
      index. METHODS: Through a three stage search strategy, we accessed and reviewed 
      86 national COVID-19 pandemic plans (and 11 Canadian provinces and territories). 
      Secondary analysis assessed any alignment between the readily accessible plans 
      and the country's transparency index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 71 national plans 
      were readily accessible while 43 were not. There were no systematic differences 
      between the countries whose plans were readily available and those whose plans 
      were 'missing'. However, most of the countries with 'missing' plans tended to 
      have a low transparency index. The framework was adapted to the pandemic context 
      by adding a parameter on the need to plan for continuity of priority routine 
      services. While document review may be the most feasible and appropriate approach 
      to conducting policy analysis during health emergencies, interviews and follow up 
      document review would assess policy implementation.

AB  - Stakeholder participation is a key component of a fair and equitable 
      priority-setting in health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for fair 
      and equitable priority setting, and hence, stakeholder participation. To date, 
      there is limited literature on stakeholder participation in the development of 
      the pandemic plans (including the priority setting plans) that were rapidly 
      developed during the pandemic. Drawing on a global study of national COVID-19 
      preparedness and response plans, we present a secondary analysis of COVID-19 
      national plans from 70 countries from the six WHO regions, focusing on 
      stakeholder participation. We found that most plans were prepared by the Ministry 
      of Health and acknowledged WHO guidance, however less than half mentioned that 
      additional stakeholders were involved. Few plans described a strategy for 
      stakeholder participation and/or accounted for public participation in the plan 
      preparation. However, diverse stakeholders (including multiple governmental, 
      non-governmental, and international organizations) were proposed to participate 
      in the implementation of the plans. Overall, there was a lack of transparency 
      about who participated in decision-making and limited evidence of meaningful 
      participation of the community, including marginalized groups. The critical 
      relevance of stakeholder participation in priority setting requires that 
      governments develop strategies for meaningful participation of diverse 
      stakeholders during pandemics such as COVID-19, and in routine healthcare 
      priority setting.

TI  - Patient perspectives on pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for antidepressant 
      prescribing in primary care: a qualitative description study.
PG  - 293-309

AB  - Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) try multiple antidepressants 
      before finding one that works well and is tolerable. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) 
      testing was developed to facilitate more efficacious prescribing. This technology 
      has not been robustly implemented clinically. Patient perspectives are critical 
      to policy decisions, but the views of patients with MDD about the use of PGx 
      testing to guide antidepressant prescribing have not been extensively examined, 
      particularly in publicly funded healthcare systems. The purpose of this 
      qualitative description study was to produce actionable patient perspectives 
      evidence to inform future technology assessment of PGx testing. We conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with 21 adults with MDD for which antidepressants were 
      indicated in Ontario, Canada, and used the Ontario Decision Determinants 
      Framework to conduct an unconstrained deductive content analysis. Patients 
      expressed views about the overall clinical benefit of PGx testing in depression 
      care, preferences for deployment of testing, perspectives on ethical 
      considerations, opinions about equity and patient care, and beliefs regarding the 
      feasibility of adopting PGx testing into the healthcare system. They also worried 
      about the possibility of conflicts of interest between PGx test manufacturers and 
      pharmaceutical companies. This study provides policymakers with patient 
      priorities to facilitate the development of patient-centred policies. It 
      highlights that formal adoption of PGx testing into the healthcare system 
      requires a focus on equity of access and health outcomes.

AB  - Engagement of patients and the public in health research is crucial for ensuring 
      research relevance and alignment with community needs. However, there is a lack 
      of nuanced evaluations and examples that promote collaborative and reflective 
      learning about partnerships with partners. The aim of this paper is to provide a 
      case example of a participatory evaluation of the engagement of older adult 
      partners in an aging-focused research centre. We outline our process of 
      co-planning and implementing an evaluation of the McMaster Collaborative for 
      Health and Aging's engagement strategy through the use of multiple methods, 
      including a standardized tool and qualitative approaches. The team chose to 
      explore and capture the engagement experiences and perspectives of the older 
      adult partners within the Collaborative using a survey (the Public and Patient 
      Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET)), an art-based method (photovoice), and a 
      focus group. We present a brief summary of the findings but primarily focus this 
      paper on the experiences of using each methodology and tool, with an emphasis on 
      promoting dialogue on the benefits, limitations, and challenges. We reflect on 
      the process of co-planning and the integration of both standardized tools and 
      qualitative approaches to adopt a holistic approach to evaluating partnership 
      within the Collaborative. Ultimately, this case example aims to provide practical 
      guidance for other research groups navigating the complexities of partnership 
      engagement and evaluation, thereby promoting meaningful partnerships in research.

OAB - Engaging older adults in research is important to match research study goals with 
      older adult needs and interests and can lead to better health outcomes and a more 
      equitable healthcare system. Yet, older adults are often excluded from research 
      due to the idea that they can be a challenging group with whom to work. The 
      McMaster Collaborative for Health and Aging is a provincial research centre 
      established to engage patients, researchers, and other key partners to improve 
      the health of and the healthcare system for older adults. The Collaborative 
      partners with older adults and caregivers in all its activities and projects. For 
      example, older adults mentor students and advise on patient-partnered research 
      projects and co-facilitate workshops. There are many frameworks and models to 
      support research partnerships with people with lived experience. Yet, evaluating 
      the quality and impacts of these partnerships is less common. This paper presents 
      a case example of a participatory evaluation of older adult partners' engagement 
      in the Collaborative. Together, older adult partners and researchers decided on 
      the project goals and methods. The evaluation used multiple methods to capture 
      partners' experiences and perspectives on the process and impact of their 
      engagement in research. First, a survey called the Public and Patient Engagement 
      Evaluation Tool (PPEET) was completed. Second, photovoice was used (a method 
      involving photography for self-expression). Finally, a focus group was conducted 
      (discussions with partners facilitated by researchers). We reflect on the 
      benefits and limitations of each method and make recommendations for future 
      evaluations. The paper underscores considering partner preferences and abilities 
      when choosing evaluation methods for patient-partnered research.

TI  - Patient and public involvement in international research: Perspectives of a team 
      of researchers from six countries on collaborating with people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and end-of-life.
PG  - e13942

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a critical priority in 
      research, policy, academia and advocacy organizations. PPI in dementia research 
      is gaining momentum. However, these efforts are missing in international projects 
      aimed at those living with advanced dementia in long-term care (LTC) homes. 
      Additional complexities can arise in enacting PPI within the context of 
      integration of a palliative approach to care and experiences around end-of-life 
      in (EOL) dementia. The mySupport study involved implementing the Family Carer 
      Decision Support (FCDS) intervention for care partners of those living with 
      advanced dementia in LTC in six countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: An 
      interpretive description study was conducted to explore the perspectives of 
      international researchers from six countries on engaging people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and EOL care in research processes. The findings from 
      this study informed the development of a PPI strategy and a subsequent toolkit 
      for the FCDS intervention. FINDINGS: Thirty-eight interviews were completed with 
      project researchers: 12 from the United Kingdom, 8 from Canada, 7 from Ireland, 4 
      each from Italy and The Netherlands and 3 from the Czech Republic. Four broad 
      themes describe international researchers' perspectives on advancing methods of 
      engagement for people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL in international 
      PPI activities: (1) Groundwork to engage in research; (2) planning for research 
      activities is key; (3) focus on meaningful engagement and (4) having foresight 
      for practical issues shaping PPI. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: International 
      projects that involve PPI can present many sources of challenges. The findings in 
      this study highlight important considerations for foundational work for 
      incorporating PPI in international projects. Learning from world leaders and 
      those with lived experiences in various regions can be insightful and help share 
      tools and resources. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: PPI was envisioned as a 
      critical part of conducting the mySupport study. The findings from this study 
      informed the development of a PPI strategy and an international Strategic Guiding 
      Council that included family carers of those living with advanced dementia in LTC 
      homes in six countries. This manuscript focused on the perspectives of 
      researchers on their engagement with people with lived experiences of dementia 
      and EOL. The perspectives of persons with lived experiences on engaging in the 
      mySupport research study will be reported in a forthcoming manuscript.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a growing role for patients, family members and caregivers 
      as consultants, collaborators and partners in health system settings in Canada. 
      However, compensation for this role is not systematized. When offered, it varies 
      in both type (e.g., one-time honorarium, salary) and amount. Further, broad-based 
      views of patient partners on compensation are still unknown. We aimed to describe 
      the types and frequency of compensation patient partners have been offered and 
      their attitudes towards compensation. METHODS: This study uses data from the 
      Canadian Patient Partner Study (CPPS) survey. The survey gathered the experiences 
      and perspectives of those who self-identified as patient partners working across 
      the Canadian health system. Three questions were about compensation, asking what 
      types of compensation participants had been offered, if they had ever refused 
      compensation, and whether they felt adequately compensated. The latter two 
      questions included open-text comments in addition to menu-based and scaled 
      response options. Basic frequencies were performed for all questions and 
      open-text comments were analyzed through inductive qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: A total of 603 individuals participated in the CPPS survey. Most 
      respondents were never or rarely offered salary (81%), honorarium (64%), gift 
      cards (80%) or material gifts (93%) while half were offered conference 
      registration and expenses at least sometimes. A total of 129 (26%) of 499 
      respondents reported refusing compensation. Of 511 respondents, half felt 
      adequately compensated always or often, and half only sometimes, rarely or never. 
      Open-text comments revealed positive, ambivalent and negative attitudes towards 
      compensation. Attitudes were framed by perceptions about their role, sentiments 
      of giving back to the health system, feelings of acknowledgement, practical 
      considerations, values of fairness and equity and accountability relationships. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that compensation is not standardized in 
      Canada. Half of survey respondents routinely feel inadequately compensated. 
      Patient partners have diverse views of what constitutes adequate compensation 
      inclusive of personal considerations such as a preference for volunteering, and 
      broader concerns such as promoting equity in patient partnership. Organizations 
      should attempt to ensure that compensation practices are clear, transparent and 
      attentive to patient partners' unique contexts. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Two patient 
      partners are members of the CPPS research team and have been fully engaged in all 
      study phases from project conception to knowledge translation. They are 
      co-authors of this manuscript. The survey was co-designed and pilot tested with 
      patient partners and survey participants were patient partners.

TI  - Public Engagement in Health Policy-Making for Older Adults: A Systematic Search 
      and Scoping Review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the world's population ages, there has been increasing attention 
      to developing health policies to support older adults. Engaging older adults in 
      policy-making is one way to ensure that policy decisions align with their needs 
      and priorities. However, ageist stereotypes often underestimate older adults' 
      ability to participate in such initiatives. This scoping review aims to describe 
      the characteristics and impacts of public engagement initiatives designed to help 
      inform health policy-making for older adults. METHODS: A systematic search of 
      peer-reviewed and grey literature (English only) describing public engagement 
      initiatives in health policy-making for older adults was conducted using six 
      electronic databases, Google and the Participedia website. No geographical, 
      methodological or time restrictions were applied to the search. Eligibility 
      criteria were purposefully broad to capture a wide array of relevant engagement 
      initiatives. The outcomes of interest included participants, engagement methods 
      and reported impacts. RESULTS: This review included 38 papers. The majority of 
      public engagement initiatives were funded or initiated by governments or 
      government agencies as a formal activity to address policy issues, compared to 
      initiatives without a clear link to a specific policy-making process (e.g., 
      research projects). While most initiatives engaged older adults as target 
      participants, there was limited reporting on efforts to achieve participant 
      diversity. Consultation-type engagement activities were most prevalent, compared 
      to deliberative and collaborative approaches. Impacts of public engagement were 
      frequently reported without formal evaluations. Notably, a few articles reported 
      negative impacts of such initiatives. CONCLUSION: This review describes how 
      public engagement practices have been conducted to help inform health 
      policy-making for older adults and the documented impacts. The findings can 
      assist policymakers, government staff, researchers and seniors' advocates in 
      supporting the design and execution of public engagement initiatives in this 
      policy sector. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Older adult partners from the 
      McMaster University Collaborative for Health and Aging provided strategic advice 
      throughout the key phases of this review, including developing a review protocol, 
      data charting and synthesis and interpreting and presenting the review findings. 
      This collaborative partnership was an essential aspect of this review, enhancing 
      its relevance and meaningfulness for older adults.

      systematic review and mixed-method integrative synthesis.

AB  - ObjectiveScreening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography aims to 
      reduce lung cancer mortality, but there is a lack of knowledge about how target 
      populations consider its potential benefits and harms.MethodsWe conducted a 
      systematic review of primary empirical studies published in any jurisdiction 
      since 2002 using an integrative meta-synthesis technique. We searched six health 
      and social science databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles, 
      abstracts, and potentially eligible full-text studies. Quantitative assessments 
      and open-ended perspectives on benefits and harms were extracted and convergently 
      integrated at analysis using a narrative approach. Study quality was 
      assessed.ResultsThe review included 26 quantitative, 18 qualitative, and 5 mixed 
      methods studies. Study quality was acceptable. Lung cancer screening was widely 
      perceived to be personally beneficial for early detection and reassurance. 
      Radiation exposure and screening accuracy were recognised as harms, but these 
      were frequently considered to be justified by early detection of lung cancer. 
      Stigma, anxiety, and fear related to screening procedures and results were 
      pervasive among current smokers. People with low incomes reported not 
      participating in screening because of potential out-of-pocket costs and 
      geographic access.ConclusionsPopulations targeted for lung cancer screening 
      tended to consider screening as personally beneficial and rationalised physical, 
      but not psychological, harms. Screening programmes should be clear about 
      benefits, use non-stigmatising design, and consider equity as a guiding 
      principle.

AB  - Canada has a rich history of public engagement in the health policy sector. 
      However, current political, economic and social challenges call for critical 
      reflection on this history, to assess whether current approaches to engaging 
      Canadian publics are up to the task, and what adaptations or new approaches might 
      be needed. If the persisting inequities in health systems across Canada are going 
      to be addressed, it is imperative that those designing, developing and 
      implementing policies find ways to reflect the needs and preferences of the 
      communities and populations most adversely affected by these inequities in their 
      decisions. The purpose of this special issue is to address this important topic 
      through a series of research papers and commentaries. Our work is targeted to 
      health policy makers across Canada who are seeking to engage with various publics 
      on a wide array of health policy issues. We offer key insights into what more 
      purposeful and equitable public engagement might look like, as well as common 
      pitfalls in public engagement practices and how they can be avoided.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Canada has a rich history of public engagement in health policy; 
      however, shifts in engagement practices over time have not been critically 
      examined. METHODOLOGY: We searched for cases of government-initiated public 
      engagement in Canadian health policy from 2000 to 2021 at the federal, provincial 
      (Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia) and pan-Canadian levels. Government 
      databases, portals and platforms for engagement were searched, followed by 
      academic and grey literature using relevant search terms. A coding scheme was 
      iteratively developed to categorize cases by target population, recruitment 
      method and type of engagement. RESULTS: We identified 132 cases of 
      government-initiated public engagement. We found a predominance of feedback and 
      consultation engagement types and self-selection recruitment, especially at the 
      federal level from 2016 onward. Engagements that targeted multiple populations 
      (patients, public and other stakeholders) were favoured overall and over time. 
      Just over 10% of cases in our survey mentioned efforts to engage with 
      equity-deserving groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results identify a heavy 
      reliance over time on more passive, indirect engagement approaches, which limit 
      opportunities for collaborative problem solving and fail to include 
      equity-deserving populations. Those overseeing the design and implementation of 
      government-initiated public engagement will draw valuable lessons from this 
      review to inform the design of engagement initatives.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public engagement in long-term care policy making in Canada has 
      primarily focused on "intermediary agents" who speak on behalf of long-term care 
      (LTC) residents and their family caregivers. Yet the legitimacy of these 
      intermediaries, as perceived by those they represent, has gone largely 
      unexplored. This study examines LTC resident and family perspectives on who can 
      legitimately represent them in LTC policy making. METHODOLOGY: We used an 
      interpretive description design, drawing on semi-structured interviews with LTC 
      residents and family caregivers in Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed using 
      inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen interviews were conducted with 19 
      participants. Three key characteristics of legitimate representatives were 
      identified: (1) willingness to act in the best interests of residents and 
      families, (2) having the necessary skills and capacity to participate in LTC 
      policy making and (3) engaging directly with residents and families. CONCLUSION: 
      Governments and civil society organizations seeking to establish and maintain 
      legitimacy in the eyes of LTC residents and family members can pursue this goal 
      by supporting intermediaries who mirror the identities or experiences of those 
      they represent, who are dedicated to serving their interests and who routinely 
      and directly engage with them to understand the realities of LTC.

AB  - Almost 50,000 people in Canada have had a medically assisted death since federal 
      legislation was passed in 2016. Still, the debate about the permissibility of 
      medical assistance in dying (MAiD) continues to rage. The central role of shared 
      values and ethics in public policy making emphasizes the importance of engaging 
      the public, particularly around heavily value-laden issues such as MAiD. Public 
      deliberation, a mode of engagement that fosters sustained and reasoned discussion 
      between participants, is well-suited to addressing such ethically contentious 
      policy issues. In this paper, we review recent efforts to engage the public on 
      assisted dying within and outside Canada and explain how public deliberation 
      could contribute substantively to MAiD policy making.

TI  - Building Engagement-Capable Environments for Health System Transformation: 
      Development and Early Implementation of a Capability Framework for Patient, 
      Family and Caregiver Engagement in Ontario Health Teams.
PG  - e70083
LID - 10.1111/hex.70083 [doi]
LID - e70083
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread calls to involve patients, families and 
      caregivers (PFCs) as partners at all levels of health system planning and design, 
      there is unevenness in how engagement efforts are supported across these 
      settings. The concept of 'engagement-capable environments' offers a way forward 
      to uncover the key requirements for sustainable, high-quality engagement, but 
      more work is needed to identify the specific competencies required to create 
      these environments. We addressed this gap by developing a capability framework 
      for Ontario Health Teams (OHTs), a newly established structure for planning, 
      designing, organizing and delivering care in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: The 
      framework was co-developed by a Working Group of OHT staff and leaders, PFC 
      partners, researchers and government personnel. Project activities occurred over 
      four phases: (1) planning, (2) evidence review and surveying of intended users to 
      identify key competencies, (3) framework design and (4) implementation. RESULTS: 
      An evidence review identified more than 90 potential competencies for this work. 
      These results were contextualized and expanded through a survey of OHT 
      stakeholders to brainstorm potential competencies, supports and enablers for 
      engagement. Surveys were completed by 69 individuals; 689 knowledge and skill 
      competency statements, 462 attitude and behaviour competency statements and 250 
      supports and enablers were brainstormed. The statements were analysed and 
      organized into initial competency categories, which were reviewed, discussed and 
      iteratively refined by Working Group members and through broader consultations 
      with the OHT community. The final framework includes six competency domains and 
      four support and enabler domains, each with sub-domain elements, mapped across a 
      three-stage maturity model. The framework has been disseminated across OHTs, and 
      its adoption and implementation are now requirements within OHT agreements. 
      CONCLUSION: The framework combines a strong conceptual foundation with actionable 
      elements informed by the literature and consultations with the intended users of 
      the framework. Although developed for OHTs, the framework should be broadly 
      applicable to other health system organizations seeking similar health system 
      transformation goals. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver 
      partners were involved at all stages and in all aspects of the work. As end users 
      of the framework, their perspectives, knowledge and opinions were critical.

TI  - Ethical Dimensions of Population-Based Lung Cancer Screening in Canada: Key 
      Informant Qualitative Description Study.
PG  - 139-153
LID - 10.1093/phe/phae008 [doi]
AB  - Normative issues associated with the design and implementation of 
      population-based lung cancer screening policies are underexamined. This study was 
      an exposition of the ethical justification for screening and potential ethical 
      issues and their solutions in Canadian jurisdictions. A qualitative description 
      study was conducted. Key informants, defined as policymakers, scientists and 
      clinicians who develop and implement lung cancer screening policies in Canada, 
      were purposively sampled and interviewed using a semi-structured guide informed 
      by population-based disease screening principles and ethical issues in cancer 
      screening. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. 
      Fifteen key informants from seven provinces were interviewed. Virtually all 
      justified screening by beneficence, describing that population benefits outweigh 
      individual harms if high-risk people are screened in organized programs according 
      to disease screening principles. Equity of screening access, stigma and lung 
      cancer primary prevention were other ethical issues identified. Key informants 
      prioritized beneficence over concerns for group-level justice issues when making 
      decisions about whether to implement screening policies. This prioritization, 
      though slight, may impede the implementation of screening policies in a way that 
      effectively addresses justice issues, a goal likely to require justice theory and 
      critical interpretation of disease screening principles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe a Patient Engagement Day from the Canadian Stroke 
      Prevention Network (C-SPIN). Patients and family members were engaged as patient 
      partners to generate and prioritize future direction for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) 
      research. METHODS: A facilitated group discussion methodology was used that 
      included a nominal group brainstorming and decision-making technique designed to 
      foster participation and idea generation. RESULTS: Twenty-four patient partners 
      attended. Priorities related to: 1) need for a curative focus and not new 
      medication (84 %), 2) identification of triggers (53 %), and 3) home-based/remote 
      monitoring (53 %). Use of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool 
      (PPEET) found patient partners understood the intent of the day, with its 
      objectives being met. Findings highlighted knowledge gaps by patient partners 
      that were previously thought to be understood. CONCLUSION: Patient partners could 
      benefit from more focused education about atrial fibrillation. Notably, the 
      priorities identified by patient partners were new to the research team, 
      reinforcing the importance of engaging with the population who will be impacted 
      by the research. INNOVATION: Little research has been undertaken examining 
      patient partner priorities regarding atrial fibrillation research. This work 
      highlights patient partners' interest in providing input and shaping future 
      research endeavors.
