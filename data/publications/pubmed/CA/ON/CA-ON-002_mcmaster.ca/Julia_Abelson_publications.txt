TI  - Sequence of a RNA templated by the 3'-OH RNA terminus of defective interfering 
      particles of vesicular stomatitis virus.
PG  - 4704-8
AB  - We have sequenced the endogenous RNA polymerase product produced by disrupted 
      purified virions of vesicular stomatitis virus defective interfering particles by 
      using the newer one-dimensional rapid gel sequencing techniques and confirming 
      this with a modified two-dimensional gel vectoring technique. The sequence of 
      this 46-nucleotide RNA is: 
      5'(pp)pACGAAGACCACAAAACCA-GAUAAAAAAUAAAAACCACAAGAGGG(U)COH3'. We infer that this 
      sequence is identical to the sequence at the 5' end of infectious vesicular 
      stomatitis virus RNA and is complementary to the sequence of the 3'-OH terminus 
      of this defective interfering particle genome RNA.

TI  - Cloning of yeast transfer RNA genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 205-8
AB  - Four thousand Escherichia coli clones containing yeast DNA inserted into the 
      plasmid pBR313 have been isolated. Of these, 175 clones were identified as 
      carrying yeast transfer RNA genes. The initial analysis of the inserted transfer 
      RNA genes via the colony hybridization technique with individual radioactive 
      transfer RNA species is reported. The data indicate that yeast transfer RNA genes 
      are not highly clustered, although some clustering exists. In addition, it was 
      observed that the reiteration number of different transfer RNA genes may vary 
      extensively.

TI  - Cloning of Beneckea genes in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 354-63
AB  - Genes from Beneckea harveyi, a luminescent marine bacterium, were cloned in 
      Escherichia coli. This was done by producing randomly sheared fragments of 
      Beneckea DNA and inserting them into the EcoRI site of plasmid pMB9 by the 
      adenine-thymine joining procedure. The hybrid plasmids were used to transform E. 
      coli C600 SF8. Among the transformants selected for tetracycline resistance, one 
      clone that appeared to complement a leucine tb mutation was identified. The 
      transformants were screened for the presence of Beneckea 5S genes. Four of these 
      clones were analyzed in detail by hybridization with 16S, 23S, and 4S Beneckea 
      RNA. The observations suggest that the ribosomal genes in Beneckea are linked, 
      but are present in a different order than those in E. coli.

TI  - Transcription and processing of intervening sequences in yeast tRNA genes.
PG  - 221-36
AB  - Genes for yeast tRNATyr and tRNAPhe have been sequenced (Goodman, Olson and Hall, 
      1977; Valenzuela et al., 1978) which contain additional nucleotides (intervening 
      sequences) within the middle of the gene that are not present in the mature tRNA. 
      We have isolated precursors to rRNATyr and tRNAPhe from a yeast 
      temperature-sensitive mutant (at the rna1 locus) which accumulates only certain 
      precursor tRNAs at the nonpermissive temperature. The tRNATyr and tRNAPhe 
      precursors were analyzed by oligonucleotide mapping; they each contain the 
      intervening sequence and fully matured 5' and 3' termini. Furthermore, these 
      precursors were used as substrates to search for an enzymatic activity which can 
      remove the intervening sequences and religate the ends. We have shown that 
      wild-type yeast contains such an activity, and that this activity specifically 
      removes the intervening sequences to produce mature-sized RNAs.

TI  - The nucleotide sequence of threonine transfer RNA coded by bacteriophage T4.
PG  - 1833-44
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a low molecular weight RNA coded by bacteriophage T4 
      (and previously identified as species alpha) has been determined. The molecule is 
      of particular biological interest for its associated biosynthetic properties. 
      This RNA is 76 nucleotides in length, contains eight modified bases, and can be 
      arranged in a cloverleaf configuration common to tRNAs. The anticodon sequence is 
      UGU, which corresponds to the threonine-specific codons ACA G. The nucleotide 
      sequence was determined primarily by nearest-neighbor analysis of RNA synthesized 
      in vitro using [alpha-32P]nucleoside triphosphates. Using the single-strand 
      specific nuclease S1, two in vivo labeled half-molecules were generated and 
      analysed. This information together with restrictions imposed by nearest-neighbor 
      data, provided a unique linear sequence of nucleotides with the features of 
      secondary structure common to tRNA molecules.

TI  - The regulatory region of the biotin operon in Escherichia coli.
PG  - 689-94
AB  - It is proposed that the biotin anabolic operon in Escherichia coli is transcribed 
      divergently from two partially overlapping face-to-face promoters. A mutation 
      that increases transcription in vivo creates an additional promoter in vitro. The 
      putative operator contains an imperfect palindromic sequence that partially 
      overlaps the promoters. The regulatory and genetic implications of these findings 
      are discussed.

AB  - A gene for Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNATrp has been sequenced which contains an 
      intervening sequence of 34 bp (H. S. Kang and J. Abelson, unpublished results). 
      The mutant yeast strain ts-136 accumulates a precursor to tRNATrp which contains 
      mature ends and is colinear with the tRNATrp gene. A nuclear extract from Xenopus 
      oocytes is capable of supporting transcription of the tRNATrp gene contained on 
      plasmid pBR313. The products are precursor tRNAs which contain the intervening 
      RNA sequence. The Xenopus extract accurately splices the precursor transcript to 
      mature-sized tRNATrp.

TI  - Splicing of yeast tRNA precursors: a two-stage reaction.
PG  - 27-35
AB  - Soluble extracts of S. cerevisiae splice tRNA precursors which contain 
      intervening sequences. The reaction goes to completion and requires ATP for the 
      production of mature sequence tRNA. In the absence of ATP, half-tRNA molecules 
      accumulate. Similar half-tRNA molecules appear as kinetic intermediates and 
      accumulate if splicing is inhibited with pure, mature tRNA. Half-tRNA molecules 
      have been purified. These half-tRNAs are efficiently ligated in an ATP-dependent 
      reaction that is inhibited by added mature tRNA. The product of ligation is the 
      expected mature sequence tRNA. The excised intervening sequence has also been 
      identified. These results suggest an enzymatic mechanism for splicing which 
      involves two independent steps.

TI  - Splicing of yeast tRNA precursors: structure of the reaction intermediates.
PG  - 37-45
AB  - The intermediates of the yeast tRNA splicing reaction have been characterized. 
      The intervening sequence is excised as an unique linear molecule. It has 
      5'-hydroxyl and 3'-phosphate termini. Correspondingly, the half-tRNA molecules 
      are shown to have a 3'-phosphate terminus on the 5' half and 5'-hydroxyl terminus 
      on the 3' half. These isolated halves have been shown to be active in the 
      ligation step of tRNA splicing. Removal of the 3'-phosphate from the 5' half 
      eliminates the ability of the 5' half to participate in ligation.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence of an arginine transfer ribonucleic acid from bacteriophage 
      T4.
PG  - 8245-53
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a phage T4-coded low molecular weight RNA, previously 
      designated polyacrylamide gel band epsilon, has been determined. This RNA can be 
      arranged in the cloverleaf configuration common to tRNAs, with an anticodon 
      sequence, U-C-U, which corresponds to the arginine-specific codons A-G-A and 
      A-G-G; it is therefore assumed to be an arginine tRNA. The complete nucleotide 
      sequence of this RNA species is: 
      pG-U-C-C-C-G-C-U-G-G-U-G-U-A-A-U-Gm2'-G-A-D-A-G-C-A-U-A-C-G-A-U-C-C-U-U-C-U-A-A-G-psi-U-U-G-C-G-G-U-C-C-U-G-G-T-psi-C-G-A-U-C-C-C-A-G-G-G-C-G-G-G-A-U-A-C-C-AOH. 
      The nucleotide sequence was determined by analysis of RNA, uniformly labeled in 
      vivo, according to the conventional techniques. In addition, RNA synthesized in 
      vitro in the presence of alpha-32P-labeled nucleoside triphosphates was analyzed 
      through the use of nearest neighbor sequencing techniques. Although a unique 
      sequence could not be determined by this latter analysis, restrictions on the 
      sequence imposed by nearest neighbor data and secondary structure common to tRNA 
      molecules allowed prediction of the correct nucleotide sequence.

TI  - Cleavage of T4 species I ribonucleic acid by Escherichia coli ribonuclease III.
PG  - 1351-71
AB  - T4 Species I RNA, a molecule 140 nucleotides in length with some structural 
      features very much like a tRNA, is specifically cleaved by an enzymatic activity 
      in Escherichia coli extracts to give three segments with 19, 48 and 73 
      nucleotides. We report the purification and characterization of the E. coli RNase 
      which cleaves two 3' phosphodiester bonds of T4 Species I RNA. This reaction has 
      many properties in common with those catalyzed by E. coli RNase III, although the 
      optimal salt conditions for T4 Species I RNA cleavage differ significantly from 
      those for other RNase III-catalyzed reactions. The reaction is not catalyzed by 
      extracts from an E. coli strain lacking RNase III activity. Furthermore, T4 
      Species I RNA is cleaved by highly purified E. coli RNase III to yield the same 
      three specific fragments. We conclude that this specific cleavage is due to the 
      action of RNase III, and that the requirement for lower ionic strength may reveal 
      further important properties about this RNA processing enzyme.

      The 122 base pairs comprising this region include the recognition sites for RNA 
      polymerase, the positive regulatory protein, CAP, and the negative regulatory 
      protein, the repressor. Identification of mutant variants of the sequence 
      combined with the in vitro biochemical studies of others has allowed us to 
      tentatively identify the recognition site for each of these proteins, and to 
      suggest how CAP might act at a distance to affect the interaction of RNA 
      polymerase with the promoter.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence determination of bacteriophage T4 species I ribonucleic acid.
PG  - 4185-206
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of T4 species I RNA, one of several stable RNA's 
      specifically coded for by bacteriophage T4, has been determined using 
      32-P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of Escherichia coli. The purified 
      RNA species which has been sequenced has been shown to hybridize well to T4 DNA 
      (Wilson J.H., Kim, J.S., and Abelson, J.N. (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 71, 547-556). The 
      sequence is: 
      pCGAUUCGAGGAAAUAUCUUUGCCGUAAGCCGAGUAGCGUUUUUGACGGAACGUUCGGAUAUGGUUGAGAUAUGGCCUUUUAAAAUAUUGAGUAGCGUCAACUACUUAAUAACCGGGUUCGAAUCCCGGCGUUUCGU-CAA-OHACA-OH. 
      Species I RNA which is 140 nucleotides long is also found to occur in shorter 
      versions with 135 to 136 nucleotides which terminate with a 3'-phosphate. The 
      molecule can be arranged in a secondary structure which shows some striking 
      similarities to the classic cloverleaf pattern of a tRNA. The molecule is 
      specifically cleaved by an E. coli nuclease into three segments by cleavage at a 
      double-stranded region in the molecule. The function of species I RNA is unknown, 
      but evidence presented elsewhere (Paddock, G.V., and Abelson, J. (1975) J. Biol. 
      Chem. 250, 4207-4219) indicates that the gene for this RNA molecule has been 
      preserved in evolution. The position of a mutation within species I RNA has been 
      determined. This mutation results in incorrect processing of the RNA and lower 
      relative yields of the RNA are present.

AB  - The nucleotide sequences of species I RNA coded for by bacteriophages T2 and T6 
      have been analyzed using 32-P-labeled material from T2 and T6-infected cultures 
      of Escherichia coli. The T1 and pancreatic ribonuclease digestion products were 
      partially analyzed and the results were compared with nucleotide sequences from 
      T4 species I RNA to obtain a minimum estimate of the number of nucleotide 
      sequence differences among the three species I RNAs. Analysis of fragments 
      obtained by digestion with epsilon-carboxymethyl-lysine-41-pancreatic 
      ribonuclease and with E. coli Q13 S30 crude extract was also performed to provide 
      some additional confirmation for the nucleotide sequences that were derived for 
      the T2 and T6 species I RNAs. T2 species I RNA was found to be different at three 
      positions in the nucleotide sequence, and unlike T4 species I RNA, contained in 
      addition the modified nucleotide, psi, in a region where the proposed secondary 
      structure is identical to the TpsiC-loop of a tRNA. T6 species I RNA was found to 
      contain nucleotide differences from the T4 species I RNA sequence at four 
      positions. The U at position 119 in the sequence appears to be modified to psi 
      only to a small extent. While a biological function for species I RNA is unknown, 
      the fact that there is over 97% homology in the sequences suggests strong 
      evolutionary pressures to retain the nucleotide sequence in the T-even genomes.

      reannealing kinetics.
PG  - 739-43
AB  - The DNA of bacteriophage Mu has been studied to characterize a region of 
      inhomogeneous sequence that occurs at one end of the molecule. The kinetics of 
      reassocation of tracer amounts of labeled host DNA in the presence of Mu DNA show 
      that Mu DNA contains a complete selection of host sequences. These host sequences 
      are shown to be covalently attached to phage-specific sequences and are present 
      at a concentration that accounts for the inhomogeneity observed in the electron 
      microscope. The significance and possible function of the host DNA attachment is 
      discussed.

TI  - Evidence for a base-pairing interaction between U6 small nuclear RNA and 5' 
      splice site during the splicing reaction in yeast.
PG  - 11269-73
AB  - U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is an essential factor in mRNA splicing. On the 
      basis of the high conservation of its sequence, it has been proposed that U6 
      snRNA may function catalytically during the splicing reaction. If this is the 
      case, it is likely that U6 snRNA interacts with the splice sites in the 
      spliceosome to catalyze the reaction. We have used UV crosslinking to analyze the 
      interactions of U6 snRNA with the splicing substrates during the yeast splicing 
      reaction. Crosslinked products in which the central region of U6 snRNA was joined 
      to the 5' splice site region of mRNA precursor and lariat intermediate were 
      identified. The crosslinking sites were precisely located in one of these 
      products. The results suggest a possible base-pairing interaction between U6 
      snRNA and the 5' splice site of the mRNA precursor.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the yeast U2 snRNA suggests a structural similarity to the 
      catalytic core of group I introns.
PG  - 819-31
AB  - We have used an in vitro reconstitution system to determine the effects of a 
      large number of mutations in the highly conserved 5' terminal domain of the yeast 
      U2 snRNA on pre-mRNA splicing. Whereas many mutations have little or no 
      functional consequence, base substitutions in two regions were found to have 
      drastic effects on pre-mRNA splicing. A previously unrecognized function for the 
      U2 snRNA in the second step of splicing was found by alteration of the absolutely 
      conserved sequence AGA upstream of the branch point recognition sequence. The 
      effects of these mutations suggest the formation of a structure involving the U2 
      snRNA similar to the guanosine-binding site found in the catalytic core of group 
      I introns.

TI  - Yeast tRNA ligase mutants are nonviable and accumulate tRNA splicing 
      intermediates.
PG  - 4577-82
AB  - We show here that yeast tRNA ligase protein is essential in the cell and 
      participates in joining together tRNA half-molecules resulting from excision of 
      the intron by the splicing endonuclease. A haploid yeast strain carrying a 
      chromosomal deletion of the ligase gene is viable only if ligase protein can be 
      supplied from a plasmid copy of the gene. When synthesis of the plasmid-borne 
      ligase gene is repressed, cells eventually die and accumulate endonuclease cut 
      but unligated half-molecules and intervening sequences. Half-molecules that 
      accumulate appear to be fully end-processed. Two temperature-sensitive ligase 
      mutant strains have been isolated; these strains accumulate a similar set of 
      unligated half-molecules at the nonpermissive temperature.

TI  - Thiophosphates in yeast U6 snRNA specifically affect pre-mRNA splicing in vitro.
PG  - 3659-64
AB  - A thorough mutational analysis of U6 RNA in combination with a functional 
      reconstitution assay, revealed that three domains are important for U6 function 
      in pre-mRNA splicing. In order to further analyze why these regions are so 
      critical for splicing, we make use of phosphorothioate substituted U6 RNAs. 
      Wild-type U6 RNA was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence 
      of either phosphorothiate (alpha-S) ATP, GTP, UTP or CTP. The functionality of 
      the transcripts was monitored by in vitro reconstitution. While substitution with 
      alpha-S ATP, GTP or UTP blocked splicing, substitution with alpha-S CTP had 
      little or no effect on splicing. We made use of this alpha-S CTP effect in an 
      attempt to elucidate which phosphates in the U6 RNA molecule play a role in the 
      first or in the second step of splicing. U6 mutants in which a change of an A, G 
      or U to C does not have any significant effect on splicing were transcribed in 
      the presence of alpha-S CTP. Observed effects on splicing thus have to be 
      attributed to the presence of the thio-substituted phosphate group rather than 
      the nucleotide change. The results of in vitro reconstitution give a clear answer 
      for at least three phosphates; two of them play a role in the first step, while 
      one of them is involved in the second step of splicing.

TI  - An essential 45 kDa yeast transmembrane protein reacts with anti-nuclear pore 
      antibodies: purification of the protein, immunolocalization and cloning of the 
      gene.
PG  - 8-18
AB  - A yeast membrane protein was isolated by its binding to tRNA Sepharose column. 
      The 45 kDa protein shares characteristics with rat liver nuclear pore proteins in 
      having reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (RL1) raised against rat liver 
      nuclear pore proteins and by the binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), 
      indicating the presence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties. 
      Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation experiments indicate that 
      the protein is located in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum of 
      the cell. The gene for the 45 kDa protein was cloned using degenerate 
      oligonucleotides derived from the N-terminal protein sequence and confirmed by 
      internal peptide sequences. The gene was named WBP1. The protein coding sequence 
      of the WBP1 gene reveals an ER entry signal peptide and a C-terminal membrane 
      spanning domain. Topological studies indicate that the C-terminus of the protein 
      is located in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic tail of the protein contains the 
      K-K-X-X signal known to be sufficient for retention of transmembrane proteins in 
      higher eukaryotic cells. Gene disruption experiments show that the 45 kDa protein 
      is essential for the vegetative life cycle of the yeast cell.

TI  - Deletion analysis of a multifunctional yeast tRNA ligase polypeptide. 
      Identification of essential and dispensable functional domains.
PG  - 7445-55
AB  - Splicing of tRNA precursors in extracts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae requires the 
      action of two enzymes: a site specific endonuclease and a tRNA ligase. The tRNA 
      ligase contains three distinct enzymatic activities: a polynucleotide kinase, a 
      cyclic phosphodiesterase, and an RNA ligase. The polypeptide also has a high 
      affinity pre-tRNA binding site based on its ability to form stable complexes with 
      pre-tRNA substrates. To investigate the organization of functional enzymatic and 
      binding elements within the polypeptide a series of defined tRNA ligase gene 
      deletions were constructed and corresponding proteins were expressed in 
      Escherichia coli as fusions with bacterial dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The 
      DHFR/ligase derivative proteins were then efficiently purified by affinity 
      chromatography. The complete ligase fusion protein retained enzymatic and binding 
      activities which were unaffected by the presence of the DHFR segment. Examination 
      of tRNA ligase deletion derivatives revealed that the amino-terminal region was 
      required for adenylylation, while the carboxyl-terminal region was sufficient for 
      cyclic phosphodiesterase activity. Deletions within the central region affected 
      kinase activity. Pre-tRNA binding activity was not strictly correlated with a 
      distinct enzymatic domain. A DHFR/ligase-derived protein lacking kinase activity 
      efficiently joined tRNA halves. We postulate that this variant utilizes a novel 
      RNA ligation mechanism.

PG  - 487-93
AB  - The product of the yeast PRP22 gene acts late in the splicing of yeast 
      pre-messenger RNA, mediating the release of the spliced mRNA from the 
      spliceosome. The predicted PRP22 protein sequence shares extensive homology with 
      that of PRP2 and PRP16 proteins, which are also involved in nuclear pre-mRNA 
      splicing. The homologous region contains sequence elements characteristic of 
      several demonstrated or putative ATP-dependent RNA helicases. A putative 
      RNA-binding motif originally identified in bacterial ribosomal protein S1 and 
      Escherichia coli polynucleotide phosphorylase has also been found in PRP22.

TI  - SSB-1 of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a nucleolar-specific, 
      silver-binding protein that is associated with the snR10 and snR11 small nuclear 
      RNAs.
PG  - 1741-51
AB  - SSB-1, the yeast single-strand RNA-binding protein, is demonstrated to be a yeast 
      nucleolar-specific, silver-binding protein. In double-label immunofluorescence 
      microscopy experiments antibodies to two other nucleolar proteins, RNA Pol I 
      190-kD and fibrillarin, were used to reveal the site of rRNA transcription; i.e., 
      the fibrillar region of the nucleolus. SSB-1 colocalized with fibrillarin in a 
      double-label immunofluorescence mapping experiment to the yeast nucleolus. SSB-1 
      is located, though, over a wider region of the nucleolus than the transcription 
      site marker. Immunoprecipitations of yeast cell extracts with the SSB-1 antibody 
      reveal that in 150 mM NaCl SSB-1 is bound to two small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs). 
      These yeast snRNAs are snR10 and snR11, with snR10 being predominant. Since snR10 
      has been implicated in pre-rRNA processing, the association of SSB-1 and snR10 
      into a nucleolar snRNP particle indicates SSB-1 involvement in rRNA processing as 
      well. Also, another yeast protein, SSB-36-kD, isolated by single-strand DNA 
      chromatography, is shown to bind silver under the conditions used for 
      nucleolar-specific staining. It is, most likely, another yeast nucleolar protein.

TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. III. Determination 
      of tRNA specificity.
PG  - 719-26
AB  - Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we have constructed a collection of Escherichia 
      coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. In order to determine their specificities, 
      these tRNAs were each used to suppress an amber (UAG) nonsense mutation in the E. 
      coli dihydrofolate reductase gene fol. The mutant proteins were purified and 
      subjected to N-terminal sequence analysis to determine which amino acid had been 
      inserted by the suppressor tRNAs at the position of the amber codon. The 
      suppressors can be classified into three groups on the basis of the protein 
      sequence information. Class I suppressors, tRNA(CUAAla2), tRNA(CUAGly1), 
      tRNA(CUAHisA), tRNA(CUALys) and tRNA(CUAProH), inserted the predicted amino acid. 
      The class II suppressors, tRNA(CUAGluA), tRNA(CUAGly2) and tRNA(CUAIle1) were 
      either partially or predominantly mischarged by the glutamine aminoacyl tRNA 
      synthetase. The class III suppressors, tRNA(CUAArg), tRNA(CUAAspM), 
      tRNA(CUAIle2), tRNA(CUAThr2), tRNA(CUAMet(m)) and tRNA(CUAVal) inserted 
      predominantly lysine.

TI  - Domains of yeast U4 spliceosomal RNA required for PRP4 protein binding, 
      snRNP-snRNP interactions, and pre-mRNA splicing in vivo.
PG  - 1185-96
AB  - U4 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) contains two intramolecular stem-loop structures, 
      located near each end of the molecule. The 5' stem-loop is highly conserved in 
      structure and separates two regions of U4 snRNA that base-pair with U6 snRNA in 
      the U4/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP). The 3' stem-loop is 
      highly divergent in structure among species and lies immediately upstream of the 
      binding site for Sm proteins. To investigate the function of these two domains, 
      mutants were constructed that delete the yeast U4 snRNA 5' stem-loop and that 
      replace the yeast 3' stem-loop with that from trypanosome U4 snRNA. Both mutants 
      fail to complement a null allele of the yeast U4 gene. The defects of the mutants 
      have been examined in heterozygous strains by native gel electrophoresis, 
      glycerol gradient centrifugation, and immunoprecipitation. The chimeric 
      yeast-trypanosome RNA does not associate efficiently with U6 snRNA, suggesting 
      that the 3' stem-loop of yeast U4 snRNA might be a binding site for a putative 
      protein that facilitates assembly of the U4/U6 complex. In contrast, the 5' 
      hairpin deletion mutant associates efficiently with U6 snRNA. However, it does 
      not bind the U4/U6-specific protein PRP4 and does not assemble into a U4/U5/U6 
      snRNA. Thus, we propose that the role of the PRP4 protein is to promote 
      interactions between the U4/U6 snRNP and the U5 snRNP.

TI  - Two domains of yeast U6 small nuclear RNA required for both steps of nuclear 
      precursor messenger RNA splicing.
PG  - 404-9
AB  - U6 is one of the five small nuclear RNA's (snRNA's) that are required for 
      splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA). The size and sequence of 
      U6 RNA are conserved among organisms as diverse as yeast and man, and so it has 
      been proposed that U6 RNA functions as a catalytic element in splicing. A 
      procedure for in vitro reconstitution of functional yeast U6 small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) with synthetic U6 RNA was applied in an attempt to 
      elucidate the function of yeast U6 RNA. Two domains in U6 RNA were identified, 
      each of which is required for in vitro splicing. Single nucleotide substitutions 
      in these two domains block splicing either at the first or the second step. 
      Invariably, U6 RNA mutants that block the first step of splicing do not enter the 
      spliceosome. On the other hand, those that block the second step of splicing form 
      a spliceosome but block cleavage at the 3' splice site of the intron. In both 
      domains, the positions of base changes that block the second step of splicing 
      correspond exactly to the site of insertion of pre-mRNA-type introns into the U6 
      gene of two yeast species, providing a possible explanation for the mechanism of 
      how these introns originated and adding further evidence for the proposed 
      catalytic role of U6 RNA.

TI  - Accumulation of pre-tRNA splicing '2/3' intermediates in a Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae mutant.
PG  - 1245-52
AB  - In an effort to identify genes involved in the excision of tRNA introns in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, temperature-sensitive mutants were screened for 
      intracellular accumulation of intron-containing tRNA precursors by RNA 
      hybridization analysis. In one mutant, tRNA splicing intermediates consisting of 
      the 5' exon covalently joined to the intron ('2/3' pre-tRNA molecules) were 
      detected in addition to unspliced precursors. The mutant cleaves pre-tRNA(Phe) in 
      vitro at the 3' exon/intron splice site, generating the 3' half molecule and 2/3 
      intermediate. The 5' half molecule and intron are not produced, indicating that 
      cleavage at the 5' splice site is suppressed. This partial splicing activity 
      co-purifies with tRNA endonuclease throughout several chromatographic steps. 
      Surprisingly, the splicing defect does not appreciably affect cell growth at 
      normal or elevated temperatures, but does confer a pseudo cold-sensitive 
      phenotype of retarded growth at 15 degrees C. The mutant falls into the 
      complementation group SEN2 previously defined by the isolation of mutants 
      defective for tRNA splicing in vitro [Winey, M. and Culbertson, M.R. (1988) 
      Genetics, 118, 609-617], although its phenotypes are distinct from those of the 
      previous sen2 isolates. The distinguishing genetic and biochemical properties of 
      this new allele, designated sen2-3, suggests the direct participation of the SEN2 
      gene product in tRNA endonuclease function.

TI  - Construction of Escherichia coli amber suppressor tRNA genes. II. Synthesis of 
      additional tRNA genes and improvement of suppressor efficiency.
PG  - 705-17
AB  - Using synthetic oligonucleotides, we have constructed 17 tRNA suppressor genes 
      from Escherichia coli representing 13 species of tRNA. We have measured the 
      levels of in vivo suppression resulting from introducing each tRNA gene into E. 
      coli via a plasmid vector. The suppressors function at varying efficiencies. Some 
      synthetic suppressors fail to yield detectable levels of suppression, whereas 
      others insert amino acids with greater than 70% efficiency. Results reported in 
      the accompanying paper demonstrate that some of these suppressors insert the 
      original cognate amino acid, whereas others do not. We have altered some of the 
      synthetic tRNA genes in order to improve the suppressor efficiency of the 
      resulting tRNAs. Both tRNA(CUAHis) and tRNA(CUAGlu) were altered by single base 
      changes, which generated -A-A- following the anticodon, resulting in a markedly 
      improved efficiency of suppression. The tRNA(CUAPro) was inactive, but a hybrid 
      suppressor tRNA consisting of the tRNA(CUAPhe) anticodon stem and loop together 
      with the remainder of the tRNA(Pro) proved highly efficient at suppressing 
      nonsense codons. Protein chemistry results reported in the accompanying paper 
      show that the altered tRNA(CUAHis) and the hybrid tRNA(CUAPro) insert only 
      histidine and proline, respectively, whereas the altered tRNA(CUAGlu) inserts 
      principally glutamic acid but some glutamine. Also, a strain deficient in release 
      factor I was employed to increase the efficiency of weak nonsense suppressors.

PG  - 16216-20
AB  - We have isolated a yeast mutant, ts352, that is temperature-sensitive for growth. 
      The mutation has a general effect on mRNA metabolism and a specific effect on 
      tRNA biosynthesis. Cells shifted to the nonpermissive temperature accumulate 
      tRNAs that are shorter than mature tRNAs. The increased ability of these tRNAs to 
      accept ATP demonstrates that growth of the ts352 mutant at the nonpermissive 
      temperature results in accumulation of tRNA with defective 3' ends. The activity 
      of ATP (CTP):tRNA-specific tRNA nucleotidyltransferase can readily be measured in 
      extracts from wild type but not mutant cells. We have cloned and sequenced the 
      wild type allele of the ts352 gene and find significant similarity between the 
      yeast protein sequence predicted from the DNA sequence and the protein predicted 
      from the sequence of the Escherichi coli tRNA nucleotidyltransferase gene. 
      Expression of the yeast gene on a multicopy plasmid increases the activity of the 
      tRNA nucleotidyltransferase in extracts. We conclude that the defect in the ts352 
      mutant is in the gene coding for yeast tRNA nucleotidyltransferase and that we 
      have isolated the yeast gene that codes for this enzyme.

TI  - Domain structure in yeast tRNA ligase.
PG  - 6132-8
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase is one of two proteins required for the splicing of precursor 
      tRNA molecules containing introns. The 95-kDa tRNA ligase has been purified to 
      homogeneity from a strain of Escherichia coli which overexpresses the protein. 
      The ligation reaction requires three enzymatic activities: phosphodiesterase, 
      polynucleotide kinase, and ligase. By partial proteolytic digestion, we have 
      produced fragments of tRNA ligase which contain the constituent activities. These 
      results provide evidence for a model in which the three constituent activities of 
      ligase are located in three distinct domains separated by protease-sensitive 
      regions. We have also located the active adenylylated site in the ligase domains. 
      It is lysine-114. The tRNA ligase sequence in this region has limited homology to 
      the active-site region of T4 RNA ligase.

TI  - A yeast mutant, PRP20, altered in mRNA metabolism and maintenance of the nuclear 
      structure, is defective in a gene homologous to the human gene RCC1 which is 
      involved in the control of chromosome condensation.
PG  - 72-80
AB  - We report on the characterization of the yeast prp20-1 mutant. In this 
      temperature-sensitive mutant, multiple steps of mRNA metabolism are affected. The 
      prp20-1 mutant strain showed alterations in mRNA steady-state levels, defective 
      mRNA splicing and changes in transcription initiation or termination when shifted 
      from the permissive to the non-permissive temperature. In addition, a change in 
      the structure of the nucleus in these cells became apparent. Electron microscopy 
      revealed an altered structure of the nucleoplasm of prp20-1 mutant cells when 
      grown at the non-permissive temperature that was not observed in cells grown at 
      the permissive temperature or in wild-type cells. The wild-type PRP20 gene was 
      isolated and sequenced. The putative PRP20 protein has a molecular weight of 52 
      kDa. We found that the PRP20 gene is identical to the yeast SRM1 gene (Clark and 
      Sprague 1989). In addition, the PRP20 protein sequence shows significant sequence 
      similarity to the human RCC1 protein (Ohtsubo et al. 1987). This protein has been 
      implicated in the control of chromosome condensation. Based on the phenotype of 
      the prp20-1 mutant and the observed sequence similarity to the human RCC1 
      protein, we postulate that the yeast PRP20 protein is involved in the control of 
      nuclear organization.

TI  - Do health service organizations and community health centres have higher disease 
      prevention and health promotion levels than fee-for-service practices?
PG  - 575-81
AB  - We interviewed health care providers representing 23 fee-for-service (FFS) 
      practices, 19 health service organizations (HSOs) and 11 community health centres 
      (CHCs) in Ontario to compare self-reported approaches to disease prevention and 
      health promotion. Few significant differences were found across practice types in 
      the presence of recall systems for screening or in knowledge of, compliance with 
      or estimated coverage for selected preventive maneuvers recommended by the 
      Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. CHCs reported a 
      significantly greater variety of formal health promotion programs and a greater 
      tendency to use nonphysician health care personnel to carry out both prevention 
      and health promotion activities. The results must be interpreted with caution 
      because of the use of self-reported data, the low response rate for FFS practices 
      and the use of a restrictive definition of disease prevention tied to evidence 
      from the reports of the task force. Thus, the results cast some doubt on the 
      common assumption that increasing the population served by alternative modes of 
      delivery such as HSOs and CHCs necessarily increases the level of disease 
      prevention and health promotion activity.

TI  - PRP5: a helicase-like protein required for mRNA splicing in yeast.
PG  - 4236-40
AB  - A 96-kDa protein predicted by the DNA sequence of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      PRP5 gene contains a domain that bears a striking resemblance to a family of RNA 
      helicases characterized by the conserved amino acid sequence Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp 
      (D-E-A-D). Previous work indicated that the product of the PRP5 gene is required 
      for splicing and that spliceosome assembly does not occur in its absence. 
      However, its precise role in splicing and the nature of its biochemical activity 
      remained unknown. To examine the role of PRP5 in splicing, we cloned the gene by 
      complementation of a temperature-sensitive mutation and determined its DNA 
      sequence. We discuss here the possible roles for an RNA helicase in splicing and 
      for the activity of the PRP5 protein.

TI  - PRP18, a protein required for the second reaction in pre-mRNA splicing.
PG  - 324-32
AB  - We have investigated the role of a novel temperature-sensitive splicing mutation, 
      prp18. We had previously demonstrated that an accumulation of the lariat 
      intermediate of splicing occurred at the restrictive temperature in vivo. We have 
      now used the yeast in vitro splicing system to show that extracts from this 
      mutant strain are heat labile for the second reaction of splicing. The heat 
      inactivation of prp18 extracts results from loss of activity of an exchangeable 
      component. Inactivated prp18 extracts are complemented by heat-inactivated 
      extracts from other mutants or by fractions from wild-type extracts. In 
      heat-inactivated prp18 extracts, 40S splicing complexes containing lariat 
      intermediate and exon 1 can assemble. The intermediates in this 40S complex can 
      be chased to products by complementing extracts in the presence of ATP. Both 
      complementation of extracts and chasing of the isolated prp18 spliceosomes takes 
      place with micrococcal nuclease-treated extracts. Furthermore, the 
      complementation profile with fractions of wild-type extracts indicates that the 
      splicing defect results from a mutation in a previously designated factor 
      required for the second step of splicing. The isolation of this mutant as 
      temperature-sensitive lethal has also facilitated cloning of the wild-type allele 
      by complementation.

TI  - Identification of five putative yeast RNA helicase genes.
PG  - 1571-5
AB  - The RNA helicase gene family encodes a group of eight homologous proteins that 
      share regions of sequence similarity. This group of evolutionarily conserved 
      proteins presumably all utilize ATP (or some other nucleoside triphosphate) as an 
      energy source for unwinding double-stranded RNA. Members of this family have been 
      implicated in a variety of physiological functions in organisms ranging from 
      Escherichia coli to human, such as translation initiation, mitochondrial mRNA 
      splicing, ribosomal assembly, and germinal line cell differentiation. We have 
      applied polymerase chain reaction technology to search for additional members of 
      the RNA helicase family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using degenerate 
      oligonucleotide primers designed to amplify DNA fragments flanked by the highly 
      conserved motifs V L D E A D and Y I H R I G, we have detected five putative RNA 
      helicase genes. Northern and Southern blot analyses demonstrated that these genes 
      are single copy and expressed in yeast. Several members of the RNA helicase 
      family share sequence identity ranging from 49.2% to 67.2%, suggesting that they 
      are functionally related. The discovery of such a multitude of putative RNA 
      helicase genes in yeast suggests that RNA helicase activities are involved in a 
      variety of fundamentally important biological processes.

TI  - Protein engineering with synthetic Escherichia coli amber suppressor genes.
PG  - 905-8
AB  - We have constructed synthetic genes encoding different Escherichia coli 
      suppressor tRNAs for use in amino acid substitution studies and protein 
      engineering. We used oligonucleotides to assemble the genes for different tRNAs 
      with the anticodon 5' CTA 3'. The suppressor genes are expressed from a synthetic 
      promoter derived from the promoter sequence of the E. coli lipoprotein gene. The 
      genes have been used to suppress an amber mutation in a protein coding sequence, 
      and the resulting altered protein has been subjected to sequence analysis to 
      determine the nature of the amino acid inserted at the amber site. Twelve amino 
      acids can now be added in response to the amber codon. We have employed these 
      suppressors to study amino acid substitutions in the lac repressor.

TI  - In vitro reconstitution of functional yeast U2 snRNPs.
PG  - 2124-36
AB  - A system for the functional reconstitution of yeast U2 snRNPs using synthetic U2 
      RNAs is described. We use oligonucleotide-directed RNase H cleavage to 
      specifically deplete yeast extracts of their endogenous full-length U2 snRNA and 
      consequently inactivate pre-mRNA splicing activity. The subsequent addition of 
      synthetic yeast U2 RNAs, derived by in vitro transcription (T7U2 RNAs), to these 
      oligonucleotide-treated extracts efficiently reconstitutes their ability to 
      splice pre-mRNA. The use of deletion derivatives of the T7U2 RNA has demonstrated 
      that the region downstream from the conserved Sm-binding site sequence in the 
      yeast U2 RNA is not absolutely required for pre-mRNA splicing activity in vitro. 
      Furthermore, we found that both human and rat U2 RNAs can function in yeast 
      extracts. We also show that point mutations in the yeast U2 RNA can be analyzed 
      using the in vitro reconstitution system. Allele-specific suppression of 
      mutations in pre-mRNA branch site sequence is observed when the appropriate 
      compensatory mutations in the branch site recognition region of the T7U2 RNA are 
      introduced. Finally, we present a model for the interaction of the U2 and U6 
      snRNAs during pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - In vitro assembly of yeast U6 snRNP: a functional assay.
PG  - 2137-50
AB  - U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is the most highly conserved spliceosomal RNA, and 
      it has been postulated to have a fundamental role in pre-mRNA splicing. To 
      elucidate this role, we developed an in vitro system for reconstituting the 
      functional U6 small ribonucleoprotein (snRNP). Treating splicing extracts with an 
      oligonucleotide complementary to the central domain of U6 snRNA leads to both 
      RNase H cleavage of the endogenous U6 snRNA and loss of splicing activity. Yeast 
      U6 RNA, synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase, is then added to the 
      oligonucleotide-treated extract, and restoration of splicing activity is 
      monitored by the subsequent addition of substrate pre-mRNA. Addition of 
      full-length, unmodified T7U6 snRNA (113 nucleotides) to oligonucleotide-treated 
      extracts restores splicing activity efficiently. Using U6 RNA transcripts 
      truncated at their 3' ends, we show that large deletions (39 nucleotides) produce 
      molecules that are unable to restore splicing activity in vitro and cannot 
      interact with the endogenous U4 snRNA or form a mature spliceosome. Finally, we 
      show that substitution of the invariant G81 with C within the T7U6 RNA abolishes 
      its ability of restoring splicing activity. Although the U4/U6 snRNP forms 
      correctly, mature spliceosomes do not assemble.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of pre-mRNA splicing mutants of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae.
PG  - 1206-16
AB  - In this study we report the isolation of temperature-sensitive mutants that 
      affect pre-mRNA splicing. A bank of approximately 1000 temperature-sensitive 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains was generated and screened on RNA gel blots by 
      hybridization with an actin intron probe. We isolated 16 mutants defining 11 new 
      complementation groups prp(rna)17-prp(rna)27 with four phenotypic classes of 
      mutants and 21 mutants in the prp2-prp11 complementation groups (formerly 
      rna2-rna11). The majority of the complementation groups share a phenotype of 
      pre-mRNA accumulation, seen in all of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 mutants. Three 
      novel classes of mutants were isolated in this study. One class, consisting of 
      two complementation groups, exhibits an accumulation of the lariat intermediate 
      of splicing, with no change in the levels of pre-mRNA. The second class, also 
      represented by two complementation groups, shows an accumulation of the intron 
      released after splicing. The third novel class, comprising one complementation 
      group, accumulates both pre-mRNA and the released intron. All mutants isolated 
      were recessive for the splicing phenotype. Only 2 of the 11 complementation 
      groups, although recessive, were not temperature sensitive. This study, together 
      with previous isolation of the prp(rna)2-prp(rna)11 groups and the spliceosomal 
      snRNAs, puts at least 26 gene products involved directly or indirectly in 
      pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - A synthetic substrate for tRNA splicing.
PG  - 90-106
AB  - A novel method for the synthesis of precursor tRNA as substrate for in vitro 
      splicing is reported. A construct consisting of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      pre-tRNAPhe gene under the control of a bacteriophage T7 promoter was assembled 
      from a set of synthetic oligonucleotides and cloned into an M13 vector. By the 
      use of T7 RNA polymerase, BstNI-runoff transcripts were produced. The resulting 
      pre-tRNA was shown to possess mature termini and was accurately spliced by highly 
      purified yeast tRNA-splicing endonuclease and ligase. Using this synthetic 
      pre-tRNA, the kinetic parameters of the tRNA-splicing endonuclease were also 
      determined. Use of this system provides several advantages for the study of 
      tRNA-splicing mechanisms. Mutant tRNA precursors can be readily synthesized. It 
      is also possible to synthesize large quantities of pre-tRNA for structural 
      studies.

TI  - Binding interactions between yeast tRNA ligase and a precursor transfer 
      ribonucleic acid containing two photoreactive uridine analogues.
PG  - 8852-61
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is one of the protein 
      components that is involved in the splicing reaction of intron-containing yeast 
      precursor tRNAs. It is an unusual protein because it has three distinct catalytic 
      activities. It functions as a polynucleotide kinase, as a cyclic 
      phosphodiesterase, and as an RNA ligase. We have studied the binding interactions 
      between ligase and precursor tRNAs containing two photoreactive uridine 
      analogues, 4-thiouridine and 5-bromouridine. When irradiated with long 
      ultraviolet light, RNA containing these analogues can form specific covalent 
      bonds with associated proteins. In this paper, we show that 4-thiouridine 
      triphosphate and 5-bromouridine triphosphate were readily incorporated into a 
      precursor tRNA(Phe) that was synthesized, in vitro, with bacteriophage T7 RNA 
      polymerase. The analogue-containing precursor tRNAs were authentic substrates for 
      the two splicing enzymes that were tested (endonuclease and ligase), and they 
      formed specific covalent bonds with ligase when they were irradiated with 
      long-wavelength ultraviolet light. We have determined the position of three major 
      cross-links and one minor cross-link on precursor tRNA(Phe) that were located 
      within the intron and near the 3' splice site. On the basis of these data, we 
      present a model for the in vivo splicing reaction of yeast precursor tRNAs.

TI  - Spliceosome assembly in yeast.
PG  - 1014-27
AB  - Precursors to mRNA become substrates for splicing by being assembled into a 
      complex multisubunit structure, the spliceosome. To study the assembly of the 
      yeast spliceosome, intermediate complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 
      nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Four splicing-dependent complexes, A1, A2-1, 
      A2-2, and B, were observed. The order of assembly of these complexes was 
      determined to be B----A2-1----A1----A2-2. The assembly process can be blocked at 
      complex A1 by addition of 5 mM EDTA or by carrying out the assembly process in 
      heat-inactivated rna2 extracts. The snRNA composition of the complexes was 
      determined by hybridization with probes for five yeast snRNAs. snR14 (U4) was 
      only found in complex A2-1, snR6 (U6) and snR7 (U5) were in complexes A1, A2-1, 
      and A2-2, whereas snR20 (U2) was in all four of the complexes. snR19 (U1) was not 
      present in any of the complexes. Hybridization with these probes was also 
      employed to detect snRNPs present in yeast splicing extracts. We found that snR6, 
      snR7, and snR14 were present together in a large complex. This complex underwent 
      an ATP-dependent dissociation to give snR7 and snR6-snR14 complexes. snR19 and 
      snR20 are present in distinct RNPs but the mobility of these is not affected by 
      ATP. A mechanism for spliceosome assembly is proposed.

TI  - An early hierarchic role of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein in spliceosome 
      assembly.
PG  - 1028-35
AB  - Splicing of nuclear precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) occurs on a large 
      ribonucleoprotein complex, the spliceosome. Several small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNP's) are subunits of this complex that assembles on the 
      pre-mRNA. Although the U1 snRNP is known to recognize the 5' splice site, its 
      roles in spliceosome formation and splice site alignment have been unclear. A new 
      affinity purification method for the spliceosome is described which has provided 
      insight into the very early stages of spliceosome formation in a yeast in vitro 
      splicing system. Surprisingly, the U1 snRNP initially recognizes sequences at or 
      near both splice junctions in the intron. This interaction must occur before the 
      other snRNP's (U2, U4, U5, and U6) can join the complex. The results suggest that 
      interaction of the two splice site regions occurs at an early stage of 
      spliceosome formation and is probably mediated by U1 snRNP and perhaps other 
      factors.

TI  - Nucleolytic processing of a tRNAArg-tRNAAsp dimeric precursor by a homologous 
      component from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1271-9
AB  - A subcellular extract from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used to transcribe 
      cloned yeast tRNA genes in vitro and to process the primary transcripts at the 5' 
      and 3' termini. Chromatographic fractionation of the extract has separated the 
      transcription components from two distinct nucleolytic activities: an 
      endonuclease that cleaves the precursors to produce mature 5' termini; and a 
      3'-5' exonuclease. These fractions have been used to elaborate a processing 
      pathway for the dimeric primary transcript of the yeast tRNAArg-tRNAAsp gene 
      pair. Under optimal conditions in vitro this gene is expressed at a rate of 200 
      transcripts/gene/hour, initiating at position -10 with respect to the mature 5' 
      terminus of tRNAArg and terminating near position +160. The primary transcripts 
      are cleaved by an endonuclease to give tRNAAsp with a mature 5' terminus, and a 
      pre-tRNAArg monomer with a 5' leader and 3' trailer sequences. A second 
      endonuclease cleavage of pre-tRNAArg generates the mature 5' terminus of tRNAArg. 
      The endonuclease cleavages are not ordered. Exonuclease activity(ies) remove the 
      spacer sequences from the 5' mature tRNAArg, and trim the 3' trailer portion from 
      tRNAAsp. Exonucleolytic removal of the 3' trailer does not require prior 
      endonuclease action, but removal of the spacer sequences from pre-tRNAArg is 
      incomplete without prior removal of the 5' leader sequences.

PG  - 14780-92
AB  - Synthetic actin and CYH2 pre-mRNAs containing a single intron are accurately 
      spliced in a soluble whole cell extract of yeast. Splicing in vitro requires ATP. 
      The excised intron is released as a lariat in which an RNA branch connects the 5' 
      end of the molecule to the last A in the "intron conserved sequence" UACUAAC. Two 
      other discrete RNA species produced during splicing in vitro may represent 
      reaction intermediates: free, linear exon 1 and a form of the intron lariat 
      extending beyond the 3' splice site to include exon 2. Both lariat forms 
      correspond to molecules previously shown to be produced during yeast pre-mRNA 
      splicing in vivo.

TI  - Mutations in conserved intron sequences affect multiple steps in the yeast 
      splicing pathway, particularly assembly of the spliceosome.
PG  - 1683-95
AB  - Yeast introns contain three highly conserved sequences which are known to be 
      required for splicing of pre-mRNA. Using in vitro mutagenesis, we have 
      synthesized seven point mutations at five different sites in these signals in the 
      yeast actin intron. The mutant introns were then inserted into each of three 
      constructs, which allowed us to assess the consequences both in vivo and in 
      vitro. In virtually every case, we found the efficiency of splicing to be 
      significantly depressed; mature mRNA levels in vivo ranged from 0 to 47% of 
      wild-type. Surprisingly, the tightest mutations were not necessarily at the sites 
      of nucleolytic cleavage and branch formation; these nucleotides are thus highly 
      preferred, but are not absolutely necessary. Moreover, while particular 
      nucleotides are specifically required for the final step in splicing, i.e. 3' 
      cleavage and exon ligation, the predominant consequence of mutation within the 
      conserved signals appears to be the inhibition of assembly of the splicing 
      complex.

TI  - RNA11 protein is associated with the yeast spliceosome and is localized in the 
      periphery of the cell nucleus.
PG  - 2379-93
AB  - The yeast rna mutations (rna2 through rna10/11) are a set of 
      temperature-sensitive mutations that result in the accumulation of pre-mRNAs at 
      the nonpermissive temperature. Most of the yeast RNA gene products are involved 
      in and essential for mRNA splicing in vitro, suggesting that they code for 
      components of the splicing machinery. We tested this proposal by using an in 
      vitro-synthesized RNA11 protein to complement the temperature-sensitive defect of 
      the rna11 extract. During the in vitro complementation, the input RNA11 protein 
      was associated with the 40S spliceosome and a 30S complex, suggesting that the 
      RNA11 protein is indeed a component of the spliceosome. The formation of the 
      RNA11-associated 30S complex did not require any exogenous RNA substrate, 
      suggesting that this 30S particle is likely to be a preassembled complex involved 
      in splicing. The RNA11-specific antibody inhibited the mRNA splicing in vitro, 
      confirming the essential role of the RNA11 protein in mRNA splicing. Finally, 
      using the anti-RNA11 antibody, we localized the RNA11 protein to the periphery of 
      the yeast nucleus.

      mature tRNA(SerUCG) transcribed in vivo, and the suppressor efficiency of amber- 
      and ochre-specific alleles of this gene.

TI  - Electron microscopic identification of the yeast spliceosome.
PG  - 3829-36
AB  - We have partially purified the yeast spliceosome by differential sedimentation in 
      glycerol gradients. By electron microscopy we have identified a particle in these 
      fractions that is the spliceosome. In 100 mM KCl buffer, the yeast spliceosome is 
      an ovoid disc with the dimensions of 20 x 23.5 nm with a central indentation. To 
      verify that these ovoid particles were spliceosomes, specific labels were used to 
      tag them. These tagged spliceosomes were then identified in the electron 
      microscope. The salt dependent shift of sedimentation rate for the spliceosome 
      can be explained by a change in size of the particle.

TI  - Mischarging mutants of Su+2 glutamine tRNA in E. coli. II. Amino acid 
      specificities of the mutant tRNAs.
PG  - 251-8
AB  - Among the mischarging mutants isolated from strains with Su+2 glutamine tRNA, two 
      double-mutants, A37A29 and A37C38, have been suggested to insert tryptophan at 
      the UAG amber mutation site as determined by the suppression patterns of a set of 
      tester mutants of bacteria and phages (Yamao et al., 1988). In this paper, we 
      screened temperature sensitive mutants of E. coli in which the mischarging 
      suppression was abolished even at the permissive temperature. Four such mutants 
      were obtained and they were identified as the mutants of a structural gene for 
      tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase (trpS). Authentic trpS mutations, such as trpS5 or 
      trpS18, also restricted the mischarging suppression. These results strongly 
      support the previous prediction that the mutant tRNAs of Su+2, A37A29 and A37C38, 
      are capable of interacting with tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase and being 
      misaminoacylated with tryptophan in vivo. However, in an assay to determine the 
      specificity of the mutant glutamin tRNAs, we detected predominantly glutamine, 
      but not any other amino acid, being inserted at an amber codon in vivo to any 
      significant degree. We conclude that the mutant tRNAs still accept mostly 
      glutamine, but can accept tryptophan in an extent for mischarging suppression. 
      Since the amber suppressors of Su+7 tryptophan tRNA and the mischarging mutants 
      of Su+3 tyrosine tRNA are charged with glutamine, structural similarity among the 
      tRNAs for glutamine, tryptophan and tyrosine is discussed.

TI  - Substrate recognition and splice site determination in yeast tRNA splicing.
PG  - 719-30
AB  - S. cerevisae tRNA introns interrupt the gene at a constant position in the 
      anticodon loop. Pre-tRNAs are matured by an endonuclease and a ligase. The 
      endonuclease alone can accurately release the intron from the pre-tRNA. Here, we 
      investigate the mechanism of splice site selection by the endonuclease. We 
      propose that it initially recognizes features in the mature domain common to all 
      tRNAs. Once positioned on the enzyme, the splice sites are recognizable because 
      they are a fixed distance from the mature domain. To test this hypothesis, we 
      developed a system for synthesizing pre-tRNA by bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. 
      To search for recognition sites, we made several mutations. Mutations of C56 and 
      U8 strongly affect endonuclease recognition of pre-tRNA. With insertion and 
      deletion mutations, we show that the anticodon stem determines splicing 
      specificity. The sequence and structure of the intron are not strong determinants 
      of splice site selection.

TI  - Structure and function of the yeast tRNA ligase gene.
PG  - 3171-6
AB  - We report here the DNA sequence of the entire coding region of the Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae tRNA ligase gene. tRNA ligase is one of two enzymes required for tRNA 
      splicing in yeast, and the enzyme is likely a single polypeptide with multiple 
      activities. We find that tRNA ligase is a basic protein of 827 amino acids 
      corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 95,400. The inferred amino 
      acid sequence for tRNA ligase is not significantly homologous to that of other 
      known proteins of similar activity. In addition to the tRNA ligase reading frame 
      and several other unidentified open reading frames, we have found two open 
      reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, near the 5'-end of the ligase structural gene. One 
      of these, ORF2, produces a divergent transcript which initiates only 125 
      nucleotides upstream of the tRNA ligase transcript, and is present in 
      approximately the same relative abundance as the transcript for tRNA ligase.

AB  - Synthetic ochre and amber tRNA suppressor genes derived from the yeast 
      tRNA(PheGAA) sequence have been constructed. They were efficiently transcribed in 
      vitro and expressed in vivo via a synthetic expression cassette. tRNA(PheUUA) and 
      tRNA(PheUUA) delta IVS (IVS = intervening sequence) are relatively inefficient 
      ochre suppressors. They are toxic to the cell when expressed on a multicopy 
      plasmid, and they do not suppress at all when present as single copies. The 
      intron does not seem to have any effect on suppression. In contrast, the amber 
      suppressor tRNA(PheCUA) delta IVS is efficient when expressed from a single-copy 
      plasmid, while its efficiency is reduced on a multicopy vector.

TI  - The subnuclear localization of tRNA ligase in yeast.
PG  - 1515-26
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase is an enzyme required for tRNA splicing. A study by indirect 
      immune fluorescence shows that this enzyme is localized in the cell nucleus. At 
      higher resolution, studies using indirect immune electron microscopy show this 
      nuclear location to be primarily at the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, 
      most likely at the nuclear pore. There is a more diffuse, secondary location of 
      ligase in a region of the nucleoplasm within 300 nm of the nuclear envelope. When 
      the amount of ligase in the cell is increased, nuclear staining increases but 
      staining of the nuclear envelope remains constant. This experiment indicates that 
      there are a limited number of ligase sites at the nuclear envelope. Since the 
      other tRNA splicing component, the endonuclease, has the characteristics of an 
      integral membrane protein, we hypothesize that it constitutes the site for the 
      interaction of ligase with the nuclear envelope.

TI  - Splicing of yeast nuclear pre-mRNA in vitro requires a functional 40S spliceosome 
      and several extrinsic factors.
PG  - 7-18
AB  - We have previously shown that extracts prepared from most of the yeast 
      temperature-sensitive rna mutants are heat sensitive for pre-mRNA splicing in 
      vitro, and that the products of the corresponding RNA genes are essential for the 
      early stages of the splicing region. In this report, we demonstrate that most 
      heat-inactivated mutant extracts do not form the spliceosome, suggesting that 
      their gene products are likely to be involved in spliceosome formation. 
      Heat-inactivated rna2 extracts, on the other hand, do form a splicing-dependent 
      40S complex containing uncleaved pre-mRNA exclusively. The pre-mRNA in the 40S 
      complex can be converted to the splicing products in the presence of ATP and 
      complementing extracts. These results demonstrate that: (1) the 40S complex 
      formed in heat-inactivated rna2 extracts is a spliceosome (termed the rna2 delta 
      spliceosome), (2) the spliceosome is a functional intermediate in the splicing 
      pathway, and (3) the splicing process can be dissected into two steps, 
      spliceosome formation and cleavage-ligation reactions. Additional results 
      indicate that at least two extrinsic factors, as well as the RNA2 gene product, 
      are required for complementation of the rna2 delta spliceosome. A three-step 
      mechanism for nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in yeast is proposed.

      required for splicing of yeast tRNA precursors in vitro. We have purified this 
      protein to near homogeneity using an affinity elution chromatographic step. 
      Purified tRNA ligase is a 90-kDa protein that, in addition to catalyzing the 
      ligation of tRNA half-molecules in the coupled splicing reaction, will also 
      ligate an artificial substrate. Using this artificial substrate, we provide 
      evidence for the existence of a previously predicted activated intermediate in 
      the ligation reaction. The amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal end of the 
      protein was determined, and we have used this information to isolate the 
      structural gene from a library of yeast DNA. We prove that this DNA encodes the 
      tRNA ligase protein by DNA sequencing and by demonstrating overproduction of the 
      protein.

TI  - Fractionation and characterization of a yeast mRNA splicing extract.
PG  - 2387-91
AB  - We have fractionated a yeast whole cell extract that can accurately splice 
      synthetic actin and CYH2 pre-mRNAs. Three fractions, designated I, II, and III, 
      have been separated by use of ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography 
      on heparin agarose. Each fraction alone has no splicing activity. Fractions I and 
      II allow the first step of the splicing reaction to proceed, giving rise to the 
      splicing intermediates, free exon 1, and intron-exon 2. Addition of fraction III 
      completes the reaction. Micrococcal nuclease treatment of the whole cell extract 
      or of either fraction I or II abolished splicing activity, indicating that 
      fractions I and II have RNA moieties that are required in the splicing reaction. 
      The nature of the RNAs was examined using antibodies directed against the 
      trimethylated cap structure unique to small nuclear RNAs. Preincubation of the 
      whole cell extract with protein A-Sepharose coupled to trimethylated cap antibody 
      abolished splicing activity. This indicates that at least one essential RNA 
      component contains a trimethyl cap. Thus, in yeast as in mammalian systems, small 
      nuclear RNAs are involved in mRNA splicing.

TI  - Construction of two Escherichia coli amber suppressor genes: tRNAPheCUA and 
      tRNACysCUA.
PG  - 6548-52
AB  - Amber suppressor genes corresponding to Escherichia coli tRNAPhe and tRNACys have 
      been constructed for use in amino acid substitution studies as well as protein 
      engineering. The genes for either tRNAPheGAA or tRNACysGCA both with the 
      anticodon 5' CTA 3' were assembled from four to six oligonucleotides, which were 
      annealed and ligated into a vector. The suppressor genes are expressed 
      constitutively from a synthetic promoter, derived from the promoter sequence of 
      the E. coli lipoprotein gene. The tRNAPhe suppressor (tRNAPheCUA) is 54-100% 
      efficient in vivo, while the tRNACys suppressor (tRNACysCUA) is 17-50% efficient. 
      To verify that the suppressors insert the predicted amino acids, both genes were 
      used to suppress an amber mutation in a protein coding sequence. NH2-terminal 
      sequence analysis of the resultant proteins revealed that tRNAPheCUA and 
      tRNACysCUA insert phenylalanine and cysteine, respectively. To demonstrate the 
      potential of these suppressors, tRNAPheCUA and tRNACysCUA have been used to 
      effect amino acid substitutions at specific sites in the E. coli lac repressor.

TI  - The yeast RNA gene products are essential for mRNA splicing in vitro.
PG  - 953-63
AB  - The yeast rna mutations (rna2-rna11) are a set of temperature-sensitive mutations 
      that result in the accumulation of intron-containing mRNA precursors at the 
      restrictive temperature. We have used the yeast in vitro splicing system to 
      investigate the role of products of the RNA genes in mRNA splicing. We have 
      tested the heat lability of the in vitro mRNA splicing reaction in extracts 
      isolated from mutant and wild-type cells. Extracts isolated from seven of the 
      nine rna mutants demonstrated heat lability in this assay, while most wild-type 
      extracts were stable under the conditions utilized. We have also demonstrated 
      that heat inactivation usually results in the specific loss of an exchangeable 
      component by showing that most combinations of heat-inactivated extracts from 
      different mutants complement one another. In three cases (rna2, rna5, and rna11), 
      the linkage of the in vitro defect to the rna mutations was ascertained by a 
      combination of reversion, tetrad, and in vitro complementation analyses. 
      Furthermore, each heat-inactivated extract was capable of complementation by at 
      least one fraction of the wild-type splicing system. Thus many of the RNA genes 
      are likely to code for products directly involved in and essential for mRNA 
      splicing.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the coordinate expression of the yeast tRNAArg-tRNAAsp 
      gene tandem.
PG  - 2436-42
AB  - tRNA genes occur in the yeast genome as highly dispersed and independent 
      transcriptional units. The 5'-tRNAArg-tRNAAsp-3' gene tandem, separated by a 
      10-base-pair spacer sequence, thus represents a rare case of tight clustering. 
      Previous in vitro studies did not reveal any primary transcript from the tRNAAsp 
      gene, but rather a dimeric precursor containing both gene sequences plus spacer, 
      which undergoes a series of maturation steps. This seems anomalous since the 
      tRNAAsp gene contains the sequences necessary for its own transcription. We found 
      that site-directed mutation of the highly conserved C at position 56 to a G in 
      the tRNAArg gene suppresses all transcription and does not activate the tRNAAsp 
      gene. Precise deletion of the entire tRNAArg gene gives a similar result. Rescue 
      of tRNAAsp gene transcription is effected either by the precise deletion of both 
      the tRNAArg gene and spacer or by the precise deletion of this gene with 
      concomitant introduction of an artificial RNA polymerase III start site in the 
      spacer. This artificial start site is ineffective if the tRNAArg gene is present 
      upstream.

      SUP53 tRNA in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 2663-73
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae leucine-inserting amber suppressor tRNA gene SUP53 
      (a tRNALeu3 allele) was used to investigate the relationship between precursor 
      tRNA structure and mature tRNA function. This gene encodes a pre-tRNA which 
      contains a 32-base intron. The mature tRNASUP53 contains a 5-methylcytosine 
      modification of the anticodon wobble base. Mutations were made in the SUP53 
      intron. These mutant genes were transcribed in an S. cerevisiae nuclear extract 
      preparation. In this extract, primary tRNA gene transcripts are end-processed and 
      base modified after addition of cofactors. The base modifications made in vitro 
      were examined, and the mutant pre-tRNAs were analyzed for their ability to serve 
      as substrates for partially purified S. cerevisiae tRNA endonuclease and ligase. 
      Finally, the suppressor function of these mutant tRNA genes was assayed after 
      their integration into the S. cerevisiae genome. Mutant analysis showed that the 
      totally intact precursor tRNA, rather than any specific sequence or structure of 
      the intron, was necessary for efficient nonsense suppression by tRNASUP53. Less 
      efficient suppressor activity correlated with the absence of the 5-methylcytosine 
      modification. Most of the intron-altered precursor tRNAs were successfully 
      spliced in vitro, indicating that modifications are not critical for recognition 
      by the tRNA endonuclease and ligase.

TI  - Intron mutations affect splicing of Saccharomyces cerevisiae SUP53 precursor 
      tRNA.
PG  - 2674-83
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae amber suppressor tRNA gene SUP53 (a tRNALeu3 allele) 
      was used to investigate the role of intron structure and sequence on precursor 
      tRNA splicing in vivo and in vitro. This gene encodes a pre-tRNA which contains a 
      32-base intervening sequence. Two types of SUP53 intron mutants were constructed: 
      ones with an internal deletion of the natural SUP53 intron and ones with a novel 
      intron. These mutant genes were transcribed in vitro, and the end-processed 
      transcripts were analyzed for their ability to serve as substrates for the 
      partially purified S. cerevisiae tRNA endonuclease and ligase. The in vitro 
      phenotype of these mutant RNAs was correlated with the in vivo suppressor tRNA 
      function of these SUP53 alleles after integration of the genes into the yeast 
      genome. Analysis of these mutant pre-tRNAs, which exhibited no perturbation of 
      the mature domain, clearly showed that intron structure and sequence can have 
      profound effects on pre-tRNA splicing. All of the mutant RNAs, which were 
      inefficiently spliced or unspliced, evidenced cleavage only at the 5' splice 
      junction. Base changes in the intron proximal to the 3' splice junction could 
      partially rescue the splicing defect. The implications of these data for tRNA 
      endonuclease-substrate interactions are discussed.

TI  - A test for intron function in the yeast actin gene.
PG  - 183-4
AB  - Many eukaryotic genes contain intervening sequences (IVS), but the rationale for 
      their existence remains a mystery. Previous studies done in our laboratory 
      demonstrated that the intron in a yeast tRNATyr gene, SUP6, does have a function. 
      We used the same approach to determine the role of introns in nuclear genes 
      encoding messenger RNAs. A single actin gene with one intron exists in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The level of actin in yeast appears to be crucial to 
      viability: either too much or too little actin inhibits growth. Therefore, small 
      effects on synthesis of actin protein resulting from the removal of the actin 
      gene intron would be expected to cause measurable changes in cell growth. In the 
      present study, an intron-deleted actin gene was constructed in vitro and was used 
      to replace the single resident actin gene in a haploid strain. Analysis of the 
      cells carrying the intron-deleted actin gene shows that the intervening sequence 
      is not essential for actin gene expression.

TI  - The "spliceosome": yeast pre-messenger RNA associates with a 40S complex in a 
      splicing-dependent reaction.
PG  - 963-7
AB  - The in vitro splicing reactions of pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) in a yeast 
      extract were analyzed by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Labeled pre-mRNA 
      appears in a 40S peak only if the pre-mRNA undergoes the first of the two partial 
      splicing reactions. RNA analysis after extraction of glycerol gradient fractions 
      shows that lariat-form intermediates, molecules that occur only in mRNA splicing, 
      are found almost exclusively in this 40S complex. Another reaction intermediate, 
      cut 5' exon RNA, can also be found concentrated in this complex. The complex is 
      stable even in 400 mM KCl, although at this salt concentration, it sediments at 
      35S and is clearly distinguishable from 40S ribosomal subunits. This complex, 
      termed a "spliceosome," is thought to contain components necessary for mRNA 
      splicing; its existence can explain how separated exons on pre-mRNA are brought 
      into contact.

TI  - Molecular consequences of specific intron mutations on yeast mRNA splicing in 
      vivo and in vitro.
PG  - 335-44
AB  - We have altered the TACTAAC sequence in the yeast CYH2m gene intron to TACTACC. 
      This mutation changes the nucleotide at the normal position of the branch in 
      intron RNA lariats produced during pre-mRNA splicing, and it prevents splicing in 
      vivo. In a yeast pre-mRNA splicing system, CYH2m pre-mRNA carrying the TACTACC 
      mutation is not specifically cut or rearranged in any way. Substitution of an A 
      for the first G of the CYH2m intron, converting the highly conserved GTATGT 5' 
      splice site sequence to ATATGT, also blocks intron excision in vivo and in vitro: 
      pre-mRNA carrying this mutation was still cut normally at the mutant 5' splice 
      site in vitro, to give authentic exon 1 and an intron-exon 2 lariat RNA with an 
      A-A 2'-5' phosphodiester linkage at the branch point. This lariat RNA is a 
      dead-end product. The subsequent cleavage at the 3' splice site is therefore 
      sensitive to the sequence of the 5' end of the intron attached at the branch 
      point.

TI  - Sequence organization and control of transcription in the bacteriophage T4 tRNA 
      region.
PG  - 545-63
AB  - Bacteriophage T4 contains genes for eight transfer RNAs and two stable RNAs of 
      unknown function. These are found in two clusters at 70 X 10(3) base-pairs on the 
      T4 genetic map. To understand the control of transcription in this region we have 
      completed the sequencing of 5000 base-pairs in this region. The sequence contains 
      a part of gene 3, gene 1, gene 57, internal protein I, the tRNA genes and five 
      open reading frames which most likely code for heretofore unidentified proteins. 
      We have used subclones of the region to investigate the kinetics of transcription 
      in vivo. The results show that transcription in this region consists of 
      overlapping early, middle and late transcripts. Transcription is directed from 
      two early promoters, one or two middle promoters and perhaps two late promoters. 
      This region contains all of the features that are seen in T4 transcription and as 
      such is a good place to study the phenomenon in more detail.

AB  - An inversion loop seen in heteroduplex mapping of the DNA of mature Mu phage 
      induced from a lysogen is observed also in defective lambda phage carrying one 
      end of Mu. 14% of the DNA of Mu, including this region, designated the G loop, is 
      shown to be to the right of all known genes in the prophage map. The 
      inhomogeneous ends of Mu are observed as a separate phenomenon and appear in all 
      mutants investigated. The recA and recBC functions of the host are not needed for 
      the inversion responsible for the G loop to take place. Deletions of Mu DNA in 
      the G-loop region have been isolated and are under study.

TI  - Transfer RNA synthesis in vitro.
PG  - 179-82
AB  - During infection of Escherichia coli, bacteriophage T4 directs the synthesis of 
      at least eight transfer RNAs and of two stable RNA species of low molecular 
      weight, of unknown function. When T4 DNA is incubated with purified RNA 
      polymerase and the appropriate substrates, a high molecular weight RNA is 
      produced. This RNA, on further incubation with a supernatant fraction prepared 
      from E. coli, is cleaved to several species of RNA. These cleaved RNAs were 
      analyzed by gel electrophoresis and fingerprint techniques, and were found to be 
      similar or identical to those made in vivo. The fingerprint analysis of one of 
      these, a tRNA(Gly), is presented. The molecule made in vitro, except for the 
      absence of modified bases, appears to be identical to the RNA made by T4-infected 
      cells. Therefore, in this system the tRNA genes are transcribed with fidelity, 
      the transcript is cleaved correctly, and the tRNAs are made in good yield.

TI  - Lariat structures are in vivo intermediates in yeast pre-mRNA splicing.
PG  - 611-21
AB  - Transcripts from an ADC1-actin gene fusion containing the yeast actin intron are 
      efficiently spliced in vivo. Four distinct forms of the excised actin intron are 
      found in poly(A)- RNA from yeast carrying this transcription unit on a multicopy 
      plasmid. Two of them migrate abnormally slowly in polyacrylamide gels, and one of 
      these contains a block to reverse transcription at the conserved UACUAAC sequence 
      (TACTAAC box). We also detect a larger RNA in the poly(A)+ fraction with abnormal 
      gel mobility and the same reverse transcriptase block. Analysis of the major 
      species of excised actin intron, labeled with 32P in vivo, reveals the presence 
      of a branch at the third A in the UACUAAC sequence. This A is linked via a 3'-5' 
      phosphodiester bond to the downstream C, and via a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond to a 
      G, presumably from the 5' end of the intron. Thus this intron RNA is in the form 
      of a lariat.

TI  - Precise excision of intervening sequences from precursor tRNAs by a 
      membrane-associated yeast endonuclease.
PG  - 525-36
AB  - Splicing of transfer RNA precursors containing intervening sequences proceeds in 
      two distinct stages: endonucleolytic cleavage, followed by ligation. We have 
      physically separated endonuclease and ligase activities from extracts of yeast 
      cells, and we report properties of the partially purified endonuclease 
      preparation. The endonuclease behaves as an integral membrane protein: it is 
      purified from a membrane fraction from which it can be solubilized with nonionic 
      detergents, and the activity of the endonuclease in the membrane fraction is 
      stimulated by nonionic detergents. The endonuclease cleaves precursor tRNAs at 
      two sites to excise the intervening sequence precisely. Both the extent and the 
      accuracy of cleavage are enhanced by the presence of spermidine; the degree of 
      stimulation varies with the pre-tRNA substrate. The cleavage products possess 
      5'-hydroxyl and 2',3'-cyclic phosphodiester termini. The cyclic phosphodiester 
      termini can be opened to 2'-phosphates by a cyclic phosphodiesterase activity in 
      the preparation.

TI  - tRNA gene transcription in yeast: effects of specified base substitutions in the 
      intragenic promoter.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - The yeast SUP53 gene encodes a leucine-inserting amber suppressor tRNA. We have 
      introduced specific base substitutions into both 5' and 3' elements of the 
      intragenic promoter of this tRNA gene. The influence of these sequence changes on 
      promoter function has been investigated by transcription of the mutant genes in a 
      homologous cell-free system. Our results do not support the idea that tertiary 
      intragenic structure is important in tRNA gene transcription. For one of the 
      SUP53 mutants we are able to suggest a plausible molecular basis for defective 
      transcription: a single base substitution in the 3' element of the intragenic 
      promoter prevents the interaction of this element with a putative transcription 
      factor.

TI  - Dimeric tRNA precursors in yeast.
PG  - 750-2
AB  - Two DNA fragments, each containing tRNA(Arg)3 and a tRNA(Asp) gene in close 
      conjunction, have been isolated from different genomic regions of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. Nucleotide Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene regions revealed 
      that in both fragments the tRNA(Arg)3 coding region is located 5'-proximal to the 
      tRNA(Asp) coding region. They are separated by an identical spacer of 10 
      nucleotides. Although the 5'-flanking sequences are different in the two 
      plasmids, some similarities are observed. To test the mode of expression of this 
      gene configuration, we transcribed the DNA fragments in a Xenopus oocyte nuclear 
      extract. Specific transcription of the yeast tRNA genes took place in an RNA 
      precursor which comprised both tRNA species. We report here that the precursor 
      RNA was processed to the mature-sized tRNA molecules, indicating the presence of 
      an enzyme activity in the Xenopus nucleus capable of cutting a dimeric tRNA 
      precursor. This is the first observation of a eukaryotic dimeric tRNA precursor.

TI  - The yeast tRNATyr gene intron is essential for correct modification of its tRNA 
      product.
PG  - 681-7
AB  - Precise deletion of the intervening sequence of a yeast tRNATyr ochre suppressor 
      gene (SUP6) significantly reduced its suppressor activity relative to that of the 
      unaltered gene. This is probably the result of the absence of the pseudouridine 
      modification, normally present at the middle anticodon position of mature 
      suppressor tRNA, in tRNA synthesized in vivo from the deleted gene.

TI  - RNA ligase in bacteria: formation of a 2',5' linkage by an E. coli extract.
PG  - 899-906
AB  - Ligase activity was detected in extracts of Escherichia coli, Clostridium 
      tartarivorum, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Chromatium gracile, and Chlorobium 
      limicola. Ligase was measured by joining of tRNA halves produced from yeast 
      IVS-containing tRNA precursors by a yeast endonuclease. The structure of tRNATyr 
      halves joined by an E. coli extract was examined. The ligated junction is 
      resistant to nuclease P1 and RNAase T2 but sensitive to venom phosphodiesterase 
      and alkaline hydrolysis, consistent with a 2',5' linkage. The nuclease-resistant 
      junction dinucleotide comigrates with authentic (2',5') APA marker in thin-layer 
      chromatography. The phosphate in the newly formed phosphodiester bond is derived 
      from the pre-tRNA substrate. The widespread existence of a bacterial ligase 
      raises the possibility of a novel class of RNA processing reactions.

      linear DNA fragments cleaved within the gene sequences to show that precursor 
      synthesis is not dependent on the internal promoter of the second gene (tRNAAsp). 
      Furthermore, the second gene does not support independent transcription when the 
      normal upstream initiation site is removed.

TI  - An RNA ligase from wheat germ which participates in transfer RNA splicing in 
      vitro.
PG  - 8365-73
AB  - Transfer RNA half-molecules are intermediates in the splicing of tRNA precursors 
      containing intervening sequences. We have utilized yeast tRNA half-molecules to 
      identify and partially purify an ATP-dependent RNA ligase activity from extracts 
      of wheat germ. This activity can complement a yeast tRNA endonuclease in vitro to 
      efficiently splice 10 different yeast tRNA precursors. The products of in vitro 
      splicing are a covalently joined tRNA and a circular intervening sequence RNA. 
      The internucleotide bond formed at the splice junction is a 2'-phosphomonoester, 
      3',5'-phosphodiester structure. The 2'-phosphate originates from the 2',3'-cyclic 
      phosphate at the 3' terminus of the 5' half-tRNA. The phosphodiester phosphate is 
      derived from the gamma-phosphate of ATP.

TI  - Enzymatic mechanism of an RNA ligase from wheat germ.
PG  - 8374-83
AB  - We have characterized the mechanism of action of a wheat germ RNA ligase which 
      has been partially purified on the basis of its ability to participate in in 
      vitro splicing of yeast tRNA precursors (Gegenheimer, P., Gabius, H-J., Peebles, 
      C.L., and Abelson, J. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 8365-8373). The preparation 
      catalyzes the ligation of oligoribonucleotide substrates forming a 
      2'-phosphomonoester, 3',5'-phosphodiester linkage. The 5' terminus of an RNA 
      substrate can have either a 5'-hydroxyl or a 5'-phosphate. The 5'-phosphate, 
      which for a 5'-hydroxyl substrate can be introduced by a polynucleotide kinase 
      activity in the preparation, is incorporated into the ligated junction. The 3' 
      terminus can have either a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate or a 2'-phosphate. 2',3'-Cyclic 
      phosphates can be converted into 2'-phosphates by a 2',3'-cyclic phosphate, 
      3'-phosphodiesterase activity in the preparation. The 2'-phosphate of the ligated 
      product is derived from the phosphate at the 3' terminus of the substrate. 
      Ligation proceeds with the adenylylation of the 5'-phosphorylated terminus to 
      form an intermediate with a 5',5'-phosphoanhydride bond.

TI  - Transcription and processing of a yeast tRNA gene containing a modified 
      intervening sequence.
PG  - 2564-8
AB  - The tRNA(3) (Leu) gene from yeast contains an intervening sequence of 32 
      nucleotides not present in mature tRNA. This sequence is transcribed and 
      subsequently removed during the maturation of the RNA. To probe the involvement 
      of this region of the gene in transcription and processing of the pre-tRNA(3) 
      (Leu), the yeast DNA was cloned in plasmid pBR322 and a 21-base-pair DNA fragment 
      corresponding to the lac operator was inserted into the intervening sequence. 
      Insertion was done at a cleavage site for the restriction endonuclease Hpa I that 
      occurs 19/20 base pairs from the 5' end of the intervening sequence. The parent 
      and modified plasmids were then transcribed in a Xenopus germinal vesicle 
      extract. RNA-fingerprint analysis of the transcription products revealed that 
      both the tRNA(3) (Leu) gene and its modified counterpart were accurately 
      transcribed. Transcription products corresponding to mature tRNA(3) (Leu) and 
      pre-RNA(3) (Leu) with the normal and lac-containing intervening sequence were 
      identified. Precursors extended at their 5' and 3' ends were also present. Both 
      parent and modified genes were transcribed efficiently, and the various products 
      accumulated in similar amounts, indicating that no deleterious effects on 
      transcriptional competence, stability of the transcripts, or processing result 
      from insertion of the 21-base-pair lac operator DNA. Incubation of pre-tRNA 
      molecules that contained intervening sequences but were 5' and 3' mature with a 
      yeast ribosomal wash fraction resulted in excision of the intervening sequence 
      and, in the presence of ATP, ligation of the resulting half-tRNA molecules. The 
      presence of RNA complementary to lac operator DNA neither inhibited the excision 
      and splicing activities nor altered the site of the junction.

TI  - Directed deletion of a yeast transfer RNA intervening sequence.
PG  - 1396-400
AB  - Many eukaryotic genes contain intevening sequences, segments of DNA that 
      interrupt the continuity of the gene. They are removed from RNA transcripts of 
      the gene by a process known as splicing. The intervening sequence in a yeast 
      tyrosine transfer RNA (tRNA Tyr) suppressor gene was deleted in order to test its 
      role in the expression of the gene. The altered gene and its parent were 
      introduced into yeast by transformation. Both genes exhibited suppressor 
      function, showing that the intervening sequence is not absolutely essential for 
      the expression of this gene.

TI  - Isolation and sequence of the gene for actin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 3912-6
AB  - The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to contain the highly conserved and 
      unbiquitous protein actin. We have used cloned actin sequences from Dictyostelium 
      discoideum to identify and clone the actin gene in yeast. Hybridization to 
      genomic fragments of yeast DNA suggest that there is a single actin gene in 
      yeast. We have determined the nucleotide sequence of that gene and its flanking 
      regions. The sequence of the gene reveals an intervening sequence of 309 base 
      pairs in the coding sequences at the 5' end of the gene. The existence and 
      location of the intervening sequence was verified by using the dideoxy chain 
      termination technique to determine the sequence at the 5' terminus of the actin 
      mRNA. The similarity of the splice junction sequences in this gene to those found 
      in higher eukaryotes suggests that yeast must possess a similar splicing enzyme.

TI  - Specificity of Prp24 binding to RNA: a role for Prp24 in the dynamic interaction 
      of U4 and U6 snRNAs.
PG  - 132-45
AB  - Prp24 was previously isolated as a suppressor of a cold-sensitive U4 mutation and 
      is required for at least the first step of splicing in vitro. Our investigation 
      of the in vitro RNA binding properties of the purified Prp24 protein shows that 
      it binds preferentially to the U4/U6 hybrid snRNAs compared to other snRNAs. The 
      interaction between Prp24 and the U4/U6 hybrid appears to involve two regions in 
      the RNA: the 39-57 region of U6 and stem II of the U4/U6 hybrid. Interestingly, 
      some U4 mutations, which destabilize stem II, increase the affinity of Prp24 for 
      the U4/U6 RNAs compared to the wild type. This suggests that the binding of Prp24 
      to the U4/U6 RNAs may involve some destabilization of the RNA duplex. We also 
      found that Prp24 can stimulate the annealing of U4 and U6, suggesting that Prp24 
      participates in both the formation and disassembly of the U4/U6 hybrid during 
      splicing.

TI  - Does the community want devolved authority? Results of deliberative polling in 
      Ontario.
PG  - 403-12
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain and contrast the informed opinions of people in five 
      decision-making groups that could have a role in devolved governance of health 
      care and social services. DESIGN: Deliberative polling. SETTING: Three rural and 
      three urban communities selected from the 32 areas covered by a district health 
      council in Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 280 citizens from five potential 
      decision-making groups: randomly selected citizens, attendees at town-hall 
      meetings, appointees to district health councils, elected officials and experts 
      in health care and social services. INTERVENTION: Participants' opinions were 
      polled during 29 structured 2-hour meetings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants' 
      opinions on their personal willingness and their group's suitability to be 
      involved in devolved decision making, desired type of decision-making 
      involvement, information preferences, preferred areas of decision-making 
      involvement and preferred composition of decision-making bodies. RESULTS: Mean 
      attendance at each meeting was 9.6 citizens. Although there were some significant 
      differences in opinion among the five potential decision-making groups, there 
      were few differences among citizens from different geographic areas. A total of 
      189 (72%) of people polled were personally willing to take on a role involving 
      responsibility for overall decision-making, but far fewer thought that their 
      group was suited to taking on responsibility (30%) or a consulting role (55%). 
      Elected officials were the most willing (85% personally willing, 50% thought 
      their group was suitable) and randomly selected citizens the least willing (60% 
      personally willing, 17% thought their group was suitable) to take responsibility 
      for overall decision making. Most citizens polled indicated less interest in 
      involvement in specific types of decisions, except for planning and setting 
      priorities, than in overall decision making. Only 24 participants (9%) rated 
      their own group as suitable to take responsibility for raising revenue, 91 (33%) 
      deemed their group suited to distribution of funds and 108 (39%) felt their group 
      was suitable for management of services. People in all five groups ranked health 
      care needs (mean rank 1.5 out of four options) as the most important and 
      preferences (mean rank 3.6) as the least important information. They rated a 
      combination body involving several community groups as the most suitable overall 
      decision-making body (8.8 on 10-point scale). Participants favoured the 
      representation of elected officials, the provincial government and experts on 
      combination bodies responsible for the specific types of decisions. Overall, as 
      the complexity of devolved decision making became clear, participants tended to 
      assign authority to traditional decision makers such as elected officials, 
      experts and the provincial government, but also favoured a consulting role for 
      attendees at town-hall meetings (i.e., interested citizens). CONCLUSION: There 
      are significant differences among groups in the community in their willingness to 
      be involved, desired roles and representation in devolved decision making on 
      health care and social services in Ontario.

TI  - Reliability and clinical validity of UM-CIDI DSM-III-R generalized anxiety 
      disorder.
PG  - 95-110
AB  - This is the first in a series of reports on the long-term test-retest reliability 
      and procedural validity of the UM-CIDI, a modified version of the Composite 
      International Diagnostic Interview used in the US National Comorbidity Survey 
      (NCS). This report focuses on DSM-III-R Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The 
      NCS administered the UM-CIDI to a nationally representative sample of 8098 
      respondents in the age range 15-54. A subsample of 36 respondents was 
      subsequently selected for clinical reappraisal of GAD, consisting of 
      reinterviewing by a clinical reappraisal interviewer who blindly readministered 
      the GAD section of the UM-CIDI followed by an expanded version of the GAD section 
      of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R (SCID). The test-retest 
      reliability of UM-CIDI/DSM-III-R lifetime GAD is Kappa = .53. When the 
      requirement that the worries be excessive or unrealistic (A2) is removed, as in 
      ICD-10 and partially in DSM-IV, reliability increases to Kappa = .78. The 
      concordance between the baseline UM-CIDI diagnosis and the SCID diagnosis is 
      Kappa = .35, while the cross-sectional concordance is Kappa = .47 (.66 when the 
      Criterion A2 requirement is removed). Item-level analysis shows that lack of 
      concordance between the UM-CIDI and the SCID is due largely to Criteria A2 and D. 
      The A2 problem could be addressed either by deemphasizing the 
      cognitive-evaluative component of GAD as in ICD-10, or by removing consideration 
      of the term "unrealistic" from the criterion as in DSM-IV and more clearly 
      specifying the meaning of the term "excessive". These options require further 
      research on similarities and differences in risk factors, course, family history, 
      and treatment response of more narrowly and broadly defined GAD. The Criterion D 
      problem is due to lack of clarity in what constitutes a symptom occurring 
      "often". This is clarified in DSM-IV. It is likely that this clarification will 
      make it possible to develop more precisely structured questions to evaluate 
      Criterion D in subsequent revisions of the UM-CIDI, resulting in improved 
      reliability and validity.

TI  - Novel substrate specificity engineered in the arabinose binding protein.
PG  - 997-1004
AB  - The L-arabinose binding protein (ABP) of Escherichia coli naturally binds 
      L-arabinose and D-galactose with very high affinity and, with reduced affinity, a 
      variety of other sugars that differ only at the C5 position of the pyranose ring. 
      However, there are stringent specificity requirements at the 1, 2, 3 and 4 
      positions. Based on the high resolution crystallographic structure of the 
      ligand-protein complex, remodelling of the binding pocket was attempted to shift 
      the specificity towards C1-substituted galactosides. To create space in the 
      vicinity of the reducing end of bound galactose, four residues, Lys10, Asp90, 
      Thr147 and Leu145, have been mutated for residues with smaller side chains. 
      Forty-seven mutants containing different combinations of these mutations were 
      tested by fluorometry for their ability to bind methyl-beta-D-galactoside 
      (met-beta-Gal) or iso-propyl-beta-D-thio-galactoside (IPTG). Two double-residue 
      mutants carrying Ser at position 147 and Ala or Gly at position 90 appeared of 
      particular interest for being able to bind met-beta-Gal or IPTG, respectively, 
      and no longer galactose. Fluorescence experiments and molecular modelling 
      indicate that the mode of binding of the new substrates to the mutant proteins 
      might be similar to that of the natural ligands to wild-type ABP.

TI  - Is reasonable access what we want? Implications of, and challenges to, current 
      Canadian policy on equity in health care.
PG  - 629-53
AB  - Considerations of equity in the context of health care systems are often related 
      closely to the presence or level of prices incurred by users of health care 
      services. Some politicians and commentators have suggested that the removal of 
      user charges under the Canadian health care system has led to equal access to 
      care. But it is not clear that the equity principle inferred from these claims 
      corresponds to the equity goals of current Canadian health policy. In this 
      article the authors identify the precise equity principle that lies behind 
      current health policy in Canada and consider the extent to which that principle 
      is reflected in the performance of the system. They then consider other 
      approaches to equity in health care in the context of the stated objectives of 
      Canadian health policy and identify the implications of pursuing reasonable 
      access in future health policy. The authors suggest that the implications of the 
      current equity goals have not been recognized by policy makers, and if they were 
      to be recognized it is not clear that they would be acceptable to Canadian 
      populations and/or policy makers. Moreover, some of the implications would appear 
      to be incompatible with other stated objectives of public policy.

TI  - Recognition of tRNA(Cys) by Escherichia coli cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase.
PG  - 7435-44
AB  - A study of the recognition of tRNA(Cys) by Escherichia coli cysteinyl-tRNA 
      synthetase using in vivo and in vitro methods was performed. All three anticodon 
      nucleotides, the discriminator nucleotide (73), and some elements within the 
      tertiary domain (the D stem/loop, the T psi C stem/loop, and the variable loop) 
      are important for recognition; the anticodon stem and acceptor stem appear to 
      contain no essential elements. A T7 RNA polymerase transcript corresponding to 
      tRNA(Cys) is only a 5.5-fold worse substrate than native tRNA(Cys) (in terms of 
      the specificity constant, kcat/Km), mainly due to an increase in the value of Km 
      for the transcript. The greatest loss of specificity caused by mutation of a 
      single nucleotide occurs when the discriminator U73 is changed; kcat/Km declines 
      3-4 orders of magnitude depending on the substitution. Mutations in the wobble 
      nucleotide of the anticodon also cause reductions in the specificity constant of 
      3 orders of magnitude, while mutations in the other anticodon nucleotides caused 
      lesser effects. Interestingly, a C35A mutation (with the phenylalanine anticodon 
      GAA) had no effect on aminoacylation by the cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. Several 
      amber suppressor tRNAs were constructed whose in vivo identity did not correlate 
      with their in vitro specificity, indicating the need for both types of 
      experiments to understand the factors which maintain tRNA specificity.

TI  - Four yeast spliceosomal proteins (PRP5, PRP9, PRP11, and PRP21) interact to 
      promote U2 snRNP binding to pre-mRNA.
PG  - 1909-25
AB  - We have analyzed the functions of several pre-mRNA processing (PRP) proteins in 
      yeast spliceosome formation. Here, we show that PRP5 (a DEAD box helicase-like 
      protein), PRP9, and PRP11 are each required for the U2 snRNP to bind to the 
      pre-spliceosome during spliceosome assembly in vitro. Genetic analyses of their 
      functions suggest that they and another protein, PRP21, act concertedly and/or 
      interact physically with each other and with the stem-loop IIa of U2 snRNA to 
      bind U2 snRNP to the pre-mRNA. Biochemical complementation experiments also 
      indicate that the PRP9 and PRP11 proteins interact. The PRP9 and PRP11 proteins 
      may be functioning similarly in yeast and mammalian cells. The requirement for 
      ATP and the helicase-like PRP5 protein suggests that these factors might promote 
      a conformational change (involving either the U1 or U2 snRNP) that is required 
      for the association of U2 snRNP with the pre-mRNA.

TI  - Yeast tRNA-splicing endonuclease cleaves precursor tRNA in a random pathway.
PG  - 672-7
AB  - Introns interrupt many of the tRNA genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at a 
      constant position in the anticodon loop. Pre-tRNA transcripts must be accurately 
      cleaved at 3' and 5' splice sites by tRNA endonuclease to release these introns. 
      In order to study splice site cleavage order, substrates were prepared in which 
      the ribose 2'-OH at each of the splice sites was phosphorylated. This 
      modification blocked cleavage by the endonuclease. We found that whichever splice 
      site was blocked the endonuclease can cleave the other site, indicating that the 
      two splice sites were cleaved independently. The endonuclease also cleaved both 
      3'- and 5'-nicked pre-tRNA(Phe). In addition, both kinds of "2/3 molecules" 
      (exon+intron) were observed in kinetic studies, indicating that they were true 
      biochemical intermediates. The rates of cleavage at the 3' and 5' splice sites of 
      pre-tRNA were compared in several ways. The results showed that the endonuclease 
      cleaves 3' and 5' sites at almost the same rate in the first cleavage, whereas in 
      the second cleavage the 3' site was cleaved faster, indicating that the rates of 
      the two routes for cleavage were unequal. These results demonstrated that the 
      endonuclease cleaved pre-tRNA in a random order, creating two routes for removal 
      of introns from pre-tRNA.

TI  - Novel activity of a yeast ligase deletion polypeptide. Evidence for GTP-dependent 
      tRNA splicing.
PG  - 2435-43
AB  - Yeast tRNA ligase possesses multiple activities which are required for the 
      joining of tRNA halves during the tRNA splicing process: cyclic 
      phosphodiesterase, kinase, adenylylate synthetase, and ligase. A deletion 
      polypeptide of a dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion protein, designated DAC, 
      was previously shown to join tRNA halves although ATP-dependent kinase activity 
      was not measurable in the assay used. We describe here a characterization of the 
      mechanism of joining used by DAC and the structure of the tRNA product. DAC 
      produces a joined tRNA and a splice junction with a structure identical to that 
      produced by DAKC, the full-length dihydrofolate reductase-ligase fusion. 
      Furthermore, DAC can use GTP as the sole cofactor in the joining reaction, in 
      contrast to DAKC, which can only complete splicing in the presence of ATP. Both 
      enzymes exhibit GTP-dependent kinase activity at 100-fold greater efficiency than 
      with ATP. These results suggest that a potential function for the center domain 
      of tRNA ligase (missing in DAC) is to provide structural integrity and aid in 
      substrate interactions and specificity. They also support the hypothesis that 
      ligase may prefer to use two different cofactors during tRNA splicing.

TI  - Multiple nucleotide cofactor use by yeast ligase in tRNA splicing. Evidence for 
      independent ATP- and GTP-binding sites.
PG  - 2444-50
AB  - We have examined multiple cofactor usage by yeast tRNA ligase in splicing in 
      vitro. The ligase mechanism of action requires expenditure of two molar 
      equivalents of nucleotide cofactor per mole of tRNA product. Recent evidence 
      (Westaway, S.K., Belford, H.G., Apostol, B.L., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. 
      (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2435-2443) demonstrated that the ligase-associated 
      kinase activity is more efficient with GTP as cofactor than with ATP. Employing a 
      ligase fusion construct with dihydrofolate reductase (Apostol, B.L., Westaway, 
      S.K., Abelson, J., and Greer, C.L. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7445-7455) for 
      purposes of enzyme purification, we performed joining assays demonstrating that 
      ATP and GTP are the most effective combination of cofactors. ATP was essential to 
      the joining reaction, while UTP, CTP, or ATP replaced GTP inefficiently. Specific 
      and functionally independent binding sites were confirmed for ATP and GTP by 
      direct binding measurement. A third site was implicated in UTP- and CTP-ligase 
      interactions. Comparison of binding constants with Kapp values determined for 
      nucleotide-dependent joining suggested both that nucleotide triphosphate binding 
      may be limiting in tRNA joining and that tRNA ligation occurs most efficiently 
      using GTP for the kinase reaction and ATP as the adenylylate synthetase cofactor.

TI  - Stages in the second reaction of pre-mRNA splicing: the final step is ATP 
      independent.
PG  - 320-9
AB  - We have analyzed pre-mRNA splicing in yeast extracts immunodepleted of the PRP18 
      protein. We find that while the first step of splicing (cleavage at the 5' splice 
      site, and generation of the exon 1 and lariat intermediates) is unaffected by the 
      absence of PRP18, the second step of splicing (excision of the lariat intron and 
      formation of mRNA) is substantially slower in the absence of PRP18. The splicing 
      intermediates that are formed in the absence of PRP18 can be rapidly chased into 
      products by the addition of purified PRP18 protein. This chasing is not dependent 
      on ATP, implying that ATP is not required during the second cleavage-and-ligation 
      reaction. This result suggests that there are ordered stages within the second 
      step of splicing and that PRP18 acts late in the second step, perhaps during the 
      catalytic step. The ATP independence also supports the idea that this reaction 
      proceeds by a transesterification mechanism.

TI  - PRP19: a novel spliceosomal component.
PG  - 1876-82
AB  - We have isolated the gene of a splicing factor, PRP19, by complementation of the 
      temperature-sensitive growth defect of the prp19 mutant of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae. The gene encodes a protein of 502 amino acid residues of molecular 
      weight 56,500, with no homology to sequences in the data base. Unlike other PRP 
      proteins or mammalian splicing factors, the sequence of PRP19 has no discernible 
      motif. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that PRP19 is associated with the 
      spliceosome during the splicing reaction. Although the exact function of PRP19 
      remains unknown, PRP19 appears to be distinct from the other PRP proteins or 
      other spliceosomal components.

TI  - A U5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle protein involved only in the second 
      step of pre-mRNA splicing in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 2959-70
AB  - The PRP18 gene, which had been identified in a screen for pre-mRNA splicing 
      mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been cloned and sequenced. Yeast strains 
      bearing only a disrupted copy of PRP18 are temperature sensitive for growth; even 
      at a low temperature, they grow extremely slowly and do not splice pre-mRNA 
      efficiently. This unusual temperature sensitivity can be reproduced in vitro; 
      extracts immunodepleted of PRP18 are temperature sensitive for the second step of 
      splicing. The PRP18 protein has been overexpressed in active form in Escherichia 
      coli and has been purified to near homogeneity. Antibodies directed against PRP18 
      precipitate the U4/U5/U6 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) from 
      yeast extracts. From extracts depleted of the U6 small nuclear RNA (snRNA), the 
      U4 and U5 snRNAs can be immunoprecipitated, while no snRNAs can be precipitated 
      from extracts depleted of the U5 snRNA. PRP18 therefore appears to be primarily 
      associated with the U5 snRNP. The antibodies against PRP18 inhibit the second 
      step of pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. Together, these results imply that the U5 
      snRNP plays a role in the second step of splicing and suggest a model for the 
      action of PRP18.

TI  - A critical analysis of studies of state drug reimbursement policies: research in 
      need of discipline.
PG  - 217-52
AB  - Concerns over pharmaceutical costs and appropriateness of medication use have led 
      state Medicaid programs to restrict drug reimbursement. This article critically 
      reviews 20 years of research on cost sharing, drug reimbursement limits, and 
      administrative limitations on access to particular drugs via formularies, 
      category exclusions, or prior authorization requirements; evaluates their 
      methodological rigor; summarizes the state of current knowledge; and proposes 
      future research directions. Drug reimbursement caps and modest cost sharing can 
      reduce the use of both essential and less important drugs in Medicaid 
      populations; severe reimbursement caps may precipitate serious unintended 
      effects. Limitations on access to particular drugs can cause both rational and 
      irrational drug substitution effects; it is unclear whether such limits reduce 
      expenditures either for drugs or for overall health care.

TI  - HIV testing practices of primary care physicians: an Ontario survey.
PG  - 172-5
AB  - To determine whether physicians are knowledgeable about the risk factors 
      associated with HIV and whether perceived testing practices coincide with testing 
      guidelines, 1,236 physicians were surveyed about which patients they would 
      recommend for HIV testing. A total of 480 usable responses were obtained 
      (response rate of 50% of the eligible sample). Most would suggest testing to 
      partners of intravenous drug users, patients who received blood transfusions 
      between 1978 and 1985, homosexuals and bisexuals, and patients with more than two 
      sexually transmitted diseases. Only 46.4% would suggest testing to patients with 
      more than two sexual partners, and 65.8% would test anyone who asks. Other 
      patients to whom physicians would recommend testing were listed by 16.2%. 
      Logistic regression (F-step) was used to examine the relationship between 
      physician characteristics and likelihood of recommending testing. As a rule, 
      physicians are knowledgeable about the major risk factors and would recommend 
      testing according to guidelines. However, there may be a difference between 
      questionnaire responses and actual practice.

TI  - Shifting boundaries in professional care.
PG  - 364-71
AB  - The nature of the work undertaken by different health professionals and 
      inter-professional boundaries are constantly shifting. The greater knowledge of 
      users of health care, and the increasing technical and organizational complexity 
      of modern medicine, have partly eroded the control of health professionals over 
      the substance of their work. The definition of a field of work as lying within 
      the province of any one profession is culturally rather than scientifically 
      determined. It is evident that care of good quality should be delivered at the 
      lowest possible cost. This might include delivery of care by a less trained 
      person than heretofore, or by someone with limited but focused training. Sharing 
      of skills is a more sensible subject for discussion than transfer of tasks. We 
      review a number of studies which show the effectiveness of inter-professional 
      substitution in various care settings, and also the effectiveness of substitution 
      by those other than health professionals. The views of users of health services 
      on inter-professional substitution need to be considered. Health professionals 
      and others need to work together to devise innovative ways of delivering 
      effective health care. The legal issues need clarification.

TI  - 18S rRNA processing requires the RNA helicase-like protein Rrp3.
PG  - 3201-7
AB  - We report the identification of a new gene, RRP3 (rRNA processing), which is 
      required for pre-rRNA processing. Rrp3 is a 60.9 kDa protein that is required for 
      maturation of the 35S primary transcript of pre-rRNA and is required for 
      cleavages leading to mature 18S RNA. RRP3 was identified in a PCR screen for DEAD 
      box genes. DEAD box genes are part of a large family of proteins homologous to 
      the eukaryotic transcription factor elF-4a. Most of these proteins are 
      RNA-dependent ATPases and some of them have RNA helicase activity. This is the 
      third yeast DEAD box protein that has been shown to be involved in rRNA assembly, 
      but the only one required for the processing of 18S RNA. Mutants of the two other 
      putative helicases, Spb4 and Drsl, both show processing defects in 25S rRNA 
      maturation. In strains where Rrp3 is depleted, 35S precursor RNA is improperly 
      processed. Cleavage normally occurs at sites A0O, Al and A2, but in the Rrp3 
      depletion stain cleavage occurs between A2 and B1. Rrp3 has been purified to 
      homogeneity and has a weak RNA-dependent ATPase activity which is not specific 
      for rRNA.

TI  - Preventive care and barriers to effective prevention. How do family physicians 
      see it?
PG  - 1693-700
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess how adequately family physicians think they are delivering 
      preventive care and to examine barriers to providing preventive care. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Primary care medical practices in south-central 
      Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred eighty family physicians and general 
      practitioners who graduated from medical school between 1972 and 1988. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Satisfactory preventive care delivery versus self-assessed 
      coverage of patients for 15 preventive maneuvers. Perceived reasons for lack of 
      success in providing recommended preventive care. RESULTS: For 10 of the 15 
      maneuvers, the proportion of physicians who regarded 90% or higher as 
      satisfactory coverage was twice as great as the proportion who thought they 
      provided that level of coverage. For 11 of the 15 maneuvers, most respondents 
      reported coverage lower than the level they regarded as satisfactory. For six 
      maneuvers, more than two thirds thought they provided less than satisfactory 
      coverage. More than two thirds of respondents suggested these barriers to 
      providing recommended preventive care: patient is healthy and does not visit; 
      patient refuses, is not interested, or does not comply; no effective systems to 
      remind patients to come in for preventive care; and priority given to presenting 
      problem. CONCLUSION: Many family physicians and general practitioners in 
      south-central Ontario provide preventive care to their patients at lower levels 
      than they consider satisfactory. They identified barriers to providing preventive 
      services successfully; these barriers suggest approaches for improving care.

TI  - Site-specific crosslinks of yeast U6 snRNA to the pre-mRNA near the 5' splice 
      site.
PG  - 995-1010
AB  - We have introduced a single photochemical crosslinking reagent into specific 
      sites in the central domain of U6 to identify the sites that are in close 
      proximity to the pre-mRNA substrate. Four distinct U6 snRNAs were synthesized 
      with a single 4-thiouridine (4-thioU) at positions 46, 51, 54, and 57, 
      respectively. Synthetic U6 RNA containing the 4-thioU modifications can 
      functionally reconstitute splicing activity in cell-free yeast splicing extracts 
      depleted of endogenous U6 snRNA. Upon photoactivation with UV (>300 nm), 4-thioU 
      at position 46 forms crosslinks to pre-mRNA near the 5' splice site at nt +4, +5, 
      +6, and +7 in the intron, whereas 4-thioU at position 51 crosslinks to the 
      pre-mRNA at positions -2, -1, +1, +2, +3, and at the invariant G in the lariat 
      intermediate. All crosslinks are dependent on the presence of ATP and the 
      splicing substrate. The two crosslinks to the pre-mRNA from position 46 and 51 of 
      U6 can also occur in prp2 heat-inactivated yeast splicing extracts blocked 
      immediately prior to the first chemical step. Significantly, the crosslink from 
      position 51 can undergo subsequent splicing when the mutant extract is 
      complemented with functional Prp2 protein in a chase experiment, indicating that 
      the crosslink reflects a functional interaction that is maintained during the 
      first step. The crosslink to lariat intermediate appears when the mutant 
      spliceosomes are complemented with functional Prp2 protein added exogenously. 
      This experiment is a paradigm for future studies in which different mutant 
      extracts are used to establish the stage in assembly at which particular RNA-RNA 
      interactions defined by unique crosslinks occur.

TI  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Prp5 protein has RNA-dependent ATPase activity with 
      specificity for U2 small nuclear RNA.
PG  - 33261-7
AB  - The Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein Prp5 is a member of the "DEAD box" family of 
      putative RNA-dependent ATPases and helicases. The protein was purified from 
      Escherichia coli and determined to be an RNA-dependent ATPase. The ATPase 
      activity is 7-fold more specific for full-length U2 than for any of the other 
      small nuclear RNAs or nonspecific RNAs tested. An RNaseH assay in extracts was 
      used to demonstrate that Prp5 mediates an ATP-dependent conformational change in 
      the intact U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein. We propose that this 
      conformational change makes the branch point pairing sequence of U2 RNA 
      accessible for pairing with the intron allowing formation of the pre-spliceosome.

TI  - In vitro studies of the Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 complex indicate a pathway for U2 small 
      nuclear ribonucleoprotein activation.
PG  - 33268-76
AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing takes place on a large ribonucleoprotein particle, the 
      spliceosome which contains the five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), 
      U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae the mRNA splicing factors, 
      Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21, are necessary for addition of the U2 snRNP to the 
      pre-mRNA in an early step of spliceosome assembly. This paper describes a study 
      of interactions between these proteins and their role in spliceosome assembly. 
      The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. Prp9 and Prp11 were purified by 
      metal affinity chromatography. Prp21 was purified using a 
      solubilization/renaturation protocol. We have combined these separately purified 
      proteins and present direct evidence of a Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 protein complex that 
      is functional in in vitro splicing assays. Characteristics of this 
      Prp9.Prp11.Prp21 complex were further investigated using proteins synthesized in 
      vitro. In addition, we found that Prp9, Prp11, and Prp21 influence the structure 
      of the U2 snRNP in a manner that alters the accessibility of the branch point 
      pairing region of the U2 snRNA to oligonucleotide- directed RNaseH cleavage. We 
      present a model, based on the data presented here and in the accompanying paper, 
      for a combined role of Prp9, Prp11, Prp21, and Prp5 in activating the U2 snRNP 
      for assembly into the pre-spliceosome.

TI  - Do female primary care physicians practise preventive care differently from their 
      male colleagues?
PG  - 2370-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether female primary care physicians' reported coverage of 
      patients eligible for certain preventive care strategies differs from male 
      physicians' reported coverage. DESIGN: A mailed survey. SETTING: Primary care 
      practices in southern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: All primary care physicians who 
      graduated between 1972 and 1988 and practised in a defined geographic area of 
      Ontario were selected from the Canadian Medical Association's physician resource 
      database. Response rate was 50%. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Answers to questions on 
      sociodemographic and practice characteristics, attitudes toward preventive care, 
      and perceptions about preventive care behaviour and practices. RESULTS: In 
      general, reported coverage for Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health 
      Examination's (CTFPHE) A and B class recommendations was low. However, more 
      female than male physicians reported high coverage of women patients for 
      female-specific preventive care measures (i.e., Pap smears, breast examinations, 
      and mammography) and for blood pressure measurement. Female physicians appeared 
      to question more patients about a greater number of health risks. Often, sex of 
      physician was the most salient factor affecting whether preventive care services 
      thought effective by the CTFPHE were offered. However, when evidence for 
      effectiveness of preventive services was equivocal or lacking, male and female 
      physicians reported similar levels of coverage. CONCLUSION: Female primary care 
      physicians are more likely than their male colleagues to report that their 
      patients eligible for preventive health measures as recommended by the CTFPHE 
      take advantage of these measures.

TI  - Site-specific deoxynucleotide substitutions in yeast U6 snRNA block splicing of 
      pre-mRNA in vitro.
PG  - 2119-29
AB  - We have identified 2'-hydroxyl groups of the U6 phosphate-ribose backbone which 
      are required for reconstitution of splicing activity in U6-depleted yeast 
      extract. To screen the 2'-hydroxyls of yeast U6 at nucleotides 39-88, spanning 
      the conserved central domain, synthetic U6 RNAs were constructed with 
      deoxyribonucleotides incorporated site specifically. Only four individual 
      deoxynucleotide substitutions blocked splicing activity: dA51 (in the ACAGAG 
      sequence), dA62 (next to the AGC triad), and dU70 and dC72 (both in the loop of 
      the 3' intramolecular stem-loop). Native gel analysis revealed that these 
      deoxy-substituted U6 RNAs were competent for assembly of spliceosomes. 
      Interestingly, a 2'-O-methyl substituent at A51, A62, U70 or C72 did not inhibit 
      splicing activity, indicating that the essential 2'-OH groups at these positions 
      in U6 act as hydrogen bond acceptors or neutral coordinated ligands. The 
      requisite 2'-hydroxyls at A62, U70 and C72 show both similarities and differences 
      relative to the positions of essential 2'-hydroxyls of catalytic domain V of 
      group II ribozymes. The identification of the essential 2'-hydroxyls at positions 
      62, 70 and 72 corroborates that the 3' intramolecular stem-loop in U6 plays an 
      important role in pre-mRNA splicing.

TI  - Provision of preventive care to unannounced standardized patients.
PG  - 185-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the relation between physician, training and practice 
      characteristics and the provision of preventive care as described in the 
      guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination. DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open to new patients within 1 
      hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 125 family physicians 
      were randomly selected from respondents to an earlier preventive care survey. Of 
      the 125, 44 (35.2%) declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) 
      initially consented but later withdrew when they closed their practices to new 
      patients. Sixty-two physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: 
      Unannounced standardized patients posing as new patients to the practice visited 
      study physicians' practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 
      scenarios: 48-year-old man, 70-year-old man, 28-year-old woman and 52-year-old 
      woman. OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of preventive care manoeuvres carrying grade 
      A, B, C, D and E recommendations from the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic 
      Health Examination that were performed, offered or advised. A standard score was 
      computed based on the performance of grade A and B manoeuvres (good or fair 
      evidence for inclusion in the periodic health examination) and the 
      non-performance of grade D and E manoeuvres (fair or good evidence for exclusion 
      from the periodic health examination). RESULTS: Study physicians performed or 
      offered 65.6% of applicable grade A manoeuvres, 31.0% of grade B manoeuvres, 
      22.4% of grade C manoeuvres, 21.8% of grade D manoeuvres and 4.9% of grade E 
      manoeuvres. The provision of evidence-based preventive care was associated with 
      solo (v. group) practice and capitation or salary (v. fee-for-service) payment 
      method. Preventive care performance was unrelated to physician's sex, 
      certification in family medicine or problem-based (v. traditional) medical school 
      curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: Preventive care guidelines of the Canadian Task Force on 
      the Periodic Health Examination have been incompletely integrated into clinical 
      practice. Research is needed to identify and reduce barriers to the provision of 
      preventive care and to develop and apply effective processes for the creation, 
      dissemination and implementation of clinical practice guidelines.

TI  - What factors influence primary care physicians' charges for their services? An 
      exploratory study using standardized patients.
PG  - 197-202
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent of variation in physicians' charges for health 
      care encounters with unannounced standardized patients and factors associated 
      with the variation. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Family practices open 
      to new patients within 1 hour's drive of Hamilton, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: A 
      stratified random sample of 125 physicians who had responded to an earlier survey 
      regarding preventive care were invited to participate. Of the 125, 44 (35.2%) 
      declined to participate, and an additional 19 (15.2%) initially consented but 
      later withdrew because they closed their practices to new patients. Sixty-two 
      physicians thus participated in the study. INTERVENTION: Unannounced standardized 
      patients posing as new patients to the practice visited study physicians' 
      practices between September 1994 and August 1995, portraying 4 scenarios: 
      28-year-old woman, 52-year-old woman, 48-year-old man and 70-year-old man. 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Physician characteristics, encounter characteristics and 
      charges made for services. RESULTS: The 62 physicians had 246 encounters with the 
      standardized patients. Charges were made to the health insurance plan for 
      services by 59 physicians for up to 4 encounters (215 encounters in all). Charges 
      varied considerably both within and across patient scenarios. Time spent with the 
      patient was an important factor predicting charges made (p < 0.01), although the 
      effect of time spent on charges varied across scenarios (p < 0.01). 
      Fee-for-service physicians charged more for their services than physicians who 
      usually had alternative billing arrangements (p < 0.01). Female physicians 
      charged more for their services than their male colleagues (p = 0.03). No 
      relation was found between quality of preventive care and charges made (p = 
      0.15). CONCLUSIONS: Physician-related factors are better able to account for the 
      variability in charges for their services than patient-related factors. 
      Physicians seeing comparable patients may earn much more or less than their 
      colleagues because of differences in the services they provide and the way they 
      apply the fee schedule. Quality-assurance techniques are likely needed to reduce 
      the variability in charges seen and increase value for money spent in health 
      care.

TI  - Evolution of a transfer RNA gene through a point mutation in the anticodon.
PG  - 1665-70
AB  - The transfer RNA (tRNA) multigene family comprises 20 amino acid-accepting 
      groups, many of which contain isoacceptors. The addition of isoacceptors to the 
      tRNA repertoire was critical to establishing the genetic code, yet the origin of 
      isoacceptors remains largely unexplored. A model of tRNA evolution, termed "tRNA 
      gene recruitment," was formulated. It proposes that a tRNA gene can be recruited 
      from one isoaccepting group to another by a point mutation that concurrently 
      changes tRNA amino acid identity and messenger RNA coupling capacity. A test of 
      the model showed that an Escherichia coli strain, in which the essential 
      tRNAUGUThr gene was inactivated, was rendered viable when a tRNAArg with a point 
      mutation that changed its anticodon from UCU to UGU (threonine) was expressed. 
      Insertion of threonine at threonine codons by the "recruited" tRNAArg was 
      corroborated by in vitro aminoacylation assays showing that its specificity had 
      been changed from arginine to threonine. Therefore, the recruitment model may 
      account for the evolution of some tRNA genes.

TI  - Crystal structure and evolution of a transfer RNA splicing enzyme.
PG  - 279-84
AB  - The splicing of transfer RNA precursors is similar in Eucarya and Archaea. In 
      both kingdoms an endonuclease recognizes the splice sites and releases the 
      intron, but the mechanism of splice site recognition is different in each 
      kingdom. The crystal structure of the endonuclease from the archaeon 
      Methanococcus jannaschii was determined to a resolution of 2.3 angstroms. The 
      structure indicates that the cleavage reaction is similar to that of ribonuclease 
      A and the arrangement of the active sites is conserved between the archaeal and 
      eucaryal enzymes. These results suggest an evolutionary pathway for splice site 
      recognition.

TI  - Fielding standardized patients in primary care settings: lessons from a study 
      using unannounced standardized patients to assess preventive care practices.
PG  - 199-206
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To document detection and suspicion rates of unannounced standardized 
      patients visiting community-based practices. DESIGN: Primary care physicians were 
      recruited to participate in a study using standardized patients. Four 
      standardized patient scenarios were used. SETTING: Community-based primary care 
      physicians' practices in southern Ontario between September 1994 and August 1995. 
      STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two primary care physicians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A 
      'believability' questionnaire completed after all four standardized patients had 
      visited the practices. RESULTS: Of the primary care physicians approached, 50% 
      (62) agreed to participate. Twenty-one per cent of all visits were suspected as 
      standardized patient encounters. Forty-six per cent suspected one or more 
      standardized patients. Only five physicians (8%) suspected all four standardized 
      patients. Reasons for suspecting standardized patients were associated with the 
      characteristics of the physician's practices, the physician's practice profile 
      and the standardized patient cover story. CONCLUSION: The portrayal of 
      asymptomatic patients seeking a new primary care physician presents unique 
      challenges. Carefully constructed cover stories, and detailed knowledge of the 
      local area and of the practices of the participating physicians is required to 
      allow standardized patients cases to be tailored to fit into primary care 
      settings without arousing suspicion.

AB  - Given the task of distributing scarce resources, decision makers are faced with 
      the question of how to involve an increasingly threatened and disenfranchised 
      public in decisions affecting their communities. This article introduces a 
      systematic approach to public involvement in community decision-making and 
      identifies key elements in the design of institutional driven public 
      participation exercises. Examples are drawn from the health care system 
      restructuring experiences of three Ontario communities.

      identification of its proteins.
PG  - 7226-31
AB  - The yeast U4/U6.U5 pre-mRNA splicing small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) is a 
      25S small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle similar in size, composition, and 
      morphology to its counterpart in human cells. The yeast U4/U6.U5 snRNP complex 
      has been purified to near homogeneity by affinity chromatography and preparative 
      glycerol gradient sedimentation. We show that there are at least 24 proteins 
      stably associated with this particle and performed mass spectrometry 
      microsequencing to determine their identities. In addition to the seven canonical 
      core Sm proteins, there are a set of U6 snRNP specific Sm proteins, eight 
      previously described U4/U6.U5 snRNP proteins, and four novel proteins. Two of the 
      novel proteins have likely RNA binding properties, one has been implicated in the 
      cell cycle, and one has no identifiable sequence homologues or functional motifs. 
      The purification of the low abundance U4/U6.U5 snRNP from yeast and the powerful 
      sequencing methodologies using small amounts of protein make possible the rapid 
      identification of novel and previously unidentified components of large, 
      low-abundance macromolecular machines from any genetically manipulable organism.

TI  - Nucleotide sequence determination of bacteriophage T4 glycine transfer 
      ribonucleic acid.
PG  - 1287-304
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of a T4 tRNA with an anticodon for glycine has been 
      determined using (32)P-labeled material from T4-infected cultures of 
      Escherichiacoli. The sequence is: 
      pGCGGAUAUCGUAUAAUGmGDAUUACCUCAGACUUCCAApsiCUGAUGAUGUGAGTpsiCGAUUCUCAUUAUCCGCUCCA-OH. 
      The 74 nucleotide sequence can be arranged in the classic cloverleaf pattern for 
      tRNAs. The anticodon of T4 tRNA(Gly) is UCC with a possible modification of the 
      U. The tRNA molecule would thus be expected to recognize the glycine codons GGG 
      and GGA. Comparative analysis of tRNAs(Gly) from T2 and T6 indicate that their 
      sequences are identical with that from T4.

TI  - tRNA leucine identity and recognition sets.
PG  - 779-93
AB  - Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are grouped into two classes based on the structure of 
      their variable loop. In Escherichia coli, tRNAs from three isoaccepting groups 
      are classified as type II. Leucine tRNAs comprise one such group. We used both in 
      vivo and in vitro approaches to determine the nucleotides that are required for 
      tRNA(Leu) function. In addition, to investigate the role of the tRNA fold, we 
      compared the in vivo and in vitro characteristics of type I tRNA(Leu) variants 
      with their type II counterparts.A minimum of six conserved tRNA(Leu) nucleotides 
      were required to change the amino acid identity and recognition of a type II 
      tRNA(Ser) amber suppressor from a serine to a leucine residue. Five of these 
      nucleotides affect tRNA tertiary structure; the G15-C48 tertiary "Levitt 
      base-pair" in tRNA(Ser) was changed to A15-U48; the number of nucleotides in the 
      alpha and beta regions of the D-loop was changed to achieve the positioning of 
      G18 and G19 that is found in all tRNA(Leu); a base was inserted at position 47n 
      between the base-paired extra stem and the T-stem; in addition the G73 
      "discriminator" base of tRNA(Ser) was changed to A73. This minimally altered 
      tRNA(Ser) exclusively inserted leucine residues and was an excellent in vitro 
      substrate for LeuRS. In a parallel experiment, nucleotide substitutions were made 
      in a glutamine-inserting type I tRNA (RNA(SerDelta); an amber suppressor in which 
      the tRNA(Ser) type II extra-stem-loop is replaced by a consensus type I loop). 
      This "type I" swap experiment was successful both in vivo and in vitro but 
      required more nucleotide substitutions than did the type II swap. The type I and 
      II swaps revealed differences in the contributions of the tRNA(Leu) acceptor stem 
      base-pairs to tRNA(Leu) function: in the type I, but not the type II fold, 
      leucine specificity was contingent on the presence of the tRNA(Leu) acceptor stem 
      sequence. The type I and II tRNAs used in this study differed only in the 
      sequence and structure of the variable loop. By altering this loop, and thereby 
      possibly introducing subtle changes into the overall tRNA fold, it became 
      possible to detect otherwise cryptic contributions of the acceptor stem sequence 
      to recognition by LeuRS. Possible reasons for this effect are discussed.

TI  - Crystal structure of a dimeric archaeal splicing endonuclease.
PG  - 639-48
AB  - The splicing endonuclease from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AF) belongs to the 
      homodimeric family of splicing endonucleases, thought to have evolved from the 
      homotetrameric endonucleases. We report here the crystal structure of the AF 
      endonuclease determined at 2.8 A. The crystal structure of the full-length AF 
      endonuclease contains a homodimer, with each monomer consisting of two homologous 
      repeats joined together by an extended polypeptide chain of ten amino acid 
      residues. The C-terminal repeat has a strong homology to that of a single subunit 
      of the previously determined homotetrameric tRNA splicing endonuclease from 
      Methanococcus jannaschii (MJ), indicating its role in catalysis. The N-terminal 
      repeat is a more degenerate form of the MJ enzyme. Thus the N-terminal repeat is 
      a "non-active" endonuclease fold evolved from the "active" one. By detailed 
      comparison of the structures of the N-terminal and the C-terminal repeats, the 
      binding region for RNA substrates containing a bulge-helix-bulge motif can be 
      identified. Based on the identified RNA-binding region, a cation-pi interaction 
      is suggested to be responsible for coordinating activities between the two active 
      sites. In addition, the full-length AF endonuclease can adopt a higher-ordered 
      fibrous structure in solution, as revealed by the unusual crystallographic 
      packing interactions and other biochemical analysis. This 4(3)-fold fibrous 
      structure adopted by the full-length enzyme is inaccessible to the RNA substrate 
      and is largely stabilized by the first 60 amino acid residues. A mutated form of 
      AF endonuclease with its first 60 residues removed catalyzes the cleavage 
      reaction at a significantly higher rate. Whether there is any role in vivo for 
      this structure-mediated modulation of activity remains to be determined.

TI  - Group behavioral therapy of obsessive-compulsive disorder: seven vs. twelve-week 
      outcomes.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that individualized behavioral exposure and 
      response prevention therapy is an effective treatment for Obsessive-Compulsive 
      Disorder. In our prior preliminary report, 7-week group exposure and response 
      prevention therapy was also found effective in reducing obsessions and 
      compulsions. The present report describes a larger sample (N=113) of treatment 
      seeking obsessive-compulsives who received group behavioral therapy. As before, 
      group exposure and response prevention significantly improved ratings of 
      obsessions, compulsions, and depression. These improvements were maintained at 
      3-month and long-term follow-up. A sub-sample of patients who received 12 weeks 
      of treatment had outcomes at the end of the group and at follow-up that did not 
      significantly differ from those who received 7 weeks of treatment. These results 
      confirm the efficacy of a 7-week behavioral treatment program administered in a 
      group format.

TI  - Characterization of U4 and U6 interactions with the 5' splice site using a S. 
      cerevisiae in vitro trans-splicing system.
PG  - 1957-70
AB  - Spliceosome assembly has been characterized as the ordered association of the 
      snRNP particles U1, U2, and U4/U6.U5 onto pre-mRNA. We have used an in vitro 
      trans-splicing/cross-linking system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear extracts 
      to examine the first step of this process, 5' splice site recognition. This 
      trans-splicing reaction has ATP, Mg(2+), and splice-site sequence requirements 
      similar to those of cis-splicing reactions. Using this system, we identified and 
      characterized a novel U4-5' splice site interaction that is ATP-dependent, but 
      does not require the branch point, the 3' splice site, or the 5' end of the U1 
      snRNA. Additionally, we identified several ATP-dependent U6 cross-links at the 5' 
      splice site, indicating that different regions of U6 sample it before a U6-5' 
      splice site interaction is stabilized that persists through the first step of 
      splicing. This work provides evidence for ATP-dependent U4/U6 association with 
      the 5' splice site independent of ATP-mediated U2 association with the branch 
      point. Furthermore, it defines specific nucleotides in U4 and U6 that interact 
      with the 5' splice site at this early stage, even in the absence of base-pairing 
      with the U1 snRNA.

TI  - Understanding the role of contextual influences on local health-care decision 
      making: case study results from Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 777-93
AB  - Approaches to involving the public in local health care decision making processes 
      (and analyses of these approaches) have tended to treat participation and publics 
      uniformly in search of the ideal method of involving the public or providing the 
      same opportunities for public participation regardless of differing 
      socio-economic, cultural, insitutional or political contexts within which 
      decisions are made. Less attention has been given to the potential for various 
      contextual factors to influence both the methods employed and the outcomes of 
      such community decision-making processes. The paper explores the role that 
      context (three sets of contextual influences more specifically) plays in shaping 
      community decision-making processes. Results from case studies of public 
      participation in local health-care decision making in four geographic communities 
      in Ontario are presented. During the study period, two of these communities were 
      actively involved in health services restructuring processes while one had 
      recently completed its process and the fourth had not yet engaged in one. Several 
      themes emerge from the case studies regarding the identification and role of 
      contextual influences in differentially shaping participation in local health 
      care decision-making. These include the propensity for communities with different 
      social and structural attributes to engage in different "styles" of 
      participation; the importance attached to "community values" in shaping both the 
      qualitative and quantitative aspects of participation: the role of health 
      councils, local government and inter-organizational collaboration as 
      participation "enablers"; and the politicization of participation that occurs 
      around contentious issues such as hospital closures.

TI  - Primary care in Canada: so much innovation, so little change.
PG  - 116-31
AB  - The development of Canadian primary care has been shaped by a series of policy 
      legacies that continue to affect the possibilities for change in primary care 
      through their cumulative effects on the health care system and the process of 
      health policy development. The pursuit of radical systemwide change in the face 
      of unfavorable circumstances (created in large part by those legacies) has 
      resulted in missed opportunities for cumulative incremental change. While major 
      changes in primary care policy seem unlikely in the near future, significant 
      incremental change is possible, but it will require a reorientation of the policy 
      development process.

TI  - Biochemical and genetic analyses of the U5, U6, and U4/U6 x U5 small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 1543-53
AB  - We have purified the yeast U5 and U6 pre-mRNA splicing small nuclear 
      ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) by affinity chromatography and analyzed the 
      associated polypeptides by mass spectrometry. The yeast U5 snRNP is composed of 
      the two variants of U5 snRNA, six U5-specific proteins and the 7 proteins of the 
      canonical Sm core. The U6 snRNP is composed of the U6 snRNA, Prp24, and the 7 
      Sm-Like (LSM) proteins. Surprisingly, the yeast DEAD-box helicase-like protein 
      Prp28 is stably associated with the U5 snRNP, yet is absent from the purified 
      U4/U6 x U5 snRNP. A novel yeast U5 and four novel yeast U4/U6 x U5 snRNP 
      polypeptides were characterized by genetic and biochemical means to demonstrate 
      their involvement in the pre-mRNA splicing reaction. We also show that, unlike 
      the human tri-snRNP, the yeast tri-snRNP dissociated upon addition of ATP or 
      dATP.

TI  - Composition and functional characterization of the yeast spliceosomal 
      penta-snRNP.
PG  - 31-44
AB  - Pre-mRNA introns are spliced in a macromolecular machine, the spliceosome. For 
      each round of splicing, the spliceosome assembles de novo in a series of 
      ATP-dependent steps involving numerous changes in RNA-RNA and RNA-protein 
      interactions. As currently understood, spliceosome assembly proceeds by addition 
      of discrete U1, U2, and U4/U6*U5 snRNPs to a pre-mRNA substrate to form 
      functional splicing complexes. We characterized a 45S yeast penta-snRNP which 
      contains all five spliceosomal snRNAs and over 60 pre-mRNA splicing factors. The 
      particle is functional in extracts and, when supplied with soluble factors, is 
      capable of splicing pre-mRNA. We propose that the spliceosomal snRNPs associate 
      prior to binding of a pre-mRNA substrate rather than with pre-mRNA via stepwise 
      addition of discrete snRNPs.

TI  - Examining the role of health services research in public policymaking.
PG  - 125-54
AB  - Conceptual, methodological, and practical issues await those who seek to 
      understand how to make better use of health services research in developing 
      public policy. Some policies and some policymaking processes may lend themselves 
      particularly well to being informed by research. Different conclusions about the 
      extent to which policymaking is informed by research may arise from different 
      views about what constitutes health services research (is it citable research or 
      any professional social inquiry that can aid in problem solving?) or different 
      views about what constitutes research use (is it explicit uses of research only, 
      or does it also include tacit knowledge or the positions of stakeholders when 
      they are informed by research and are influential in the policymaking process?). 
      Some conditions may favor the use of research in policymaking, like sustained 
      interactions between researchers and policymakers. Results from an exploratory 
      study on the use of health services research by Canadian provincial policymakers 
      illustrate these issues.

TI  - 'The public is too subjective': public involvement at different levels of 
      health-care decision making.
PG  - 1825-37
AB  - There are a number of impulses towards public participation in health care 
      decision making including instrumentalist, communitarian, educative and 
      expressive impulses and the desire for increased accountability. There has, 
      however, been little research looking systematically at the public's preferences 
      for being involved in particular types of rationing decisions, nor indeed, has 
      there been a critical examination of the degree of involvement desired by the 
      public. The research reported here uses findings from focus groups and in-depth 
      interviews to explore these questions. Eight focus groups were conducted with a 
      total of 57 informants, four amongst randomly selected members of the public and 
      four with informants from health and non-health related organisations. Nineteen 
      interviews were conducted to allow the elaboration of focus group comments, to 
      probe views more deeply and to pursue emerging themes. The findings show 
      variations in the willingness of members of the public to be involved in health 
      care decisions and consistency across the different forms of the public as 
      represented by the focus groups with randomly selected citizens and pre-existing 
      organisations. There was a strong desire in all the groups for the public to be 
      involved both at the system and programme levels, with much less willingness to 
      be involved at the individual level. At the system and programme levels 
      informants generally favoured consultation, without responsibility for decisions, 
      but with the guarantee that their contribution would be heard and that decisions 
      taken following consultation would be explained. At the patient level informants 
      felt that the public should participate only by setting criteria for deciding 
      between potential beneficiaries of treatment. The public has much to contribute, 
      particularly at the system and programme levels, to supplement the inputs of 
      health care professionals.

TI  - The 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6 snRNA: Lsm proteins facilitate binding of Prp24 
      protein to the U6 telestem region.
PG  - 1011-33
AB  - The 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6 snRNA contain sequences that are thought to be 
      important for binding to Prp24 and Lsm proteins. By extensive mutational analysis 
      of yeast U6 snRNA, we confirmed that the 3' terminal uridine tract of U6 snRNA is 
      important for U6 binding to Lsm proteins in yeast. Binding of Prp24 protein to U6 
      RNA is dependent on or is strongly enhanced by U6 binding of Lsm proteins. This 
      supports a model for U6 snRNP assembly in which U6 RNA binds to the Lsm2-8 core 
      prior to binding Prp24 protein. Using compensatory base-pairing analysis, we show 
      that at least half of the recently identified U6 telestem as well as a nucleotide 
      sequence in the other half of the telestem are important for binding of U6 RNA to 
      Prp24 protein. Surprisingly, disruption of base pairing in the unconfirmed half 
      of the telestem enhanced U6-Prp24 binding. Truncation of the entire 3' terminal 
      domain or nearly the entire 5' terminal domain of yeast U6 allowed for detectable 
      levels of splicing to proceed in vitro. In addition to gaining knowledge of the 
      function of the 5' and 3' domains of yeast U6, our results help define the 
      minimal set of requirements for yeast U6 RNA function in splicing. We present a 
      revised secondary structural model of yeast U6 snRNA in free U6 snRNPs.

TI  - The conserved central domain of yeast U6 snRNA: importance of U2-U6 helix Ia in 
      spliceosome assembly.
PG  - 997-1010
AB  - In the pre-mRNA processing machinery of eukaryotic cells, U6 snRNA is located at 
      or near the active site for pre-mRNA splicing catalysis, and U6 is involved in 
      catalyzing the first chemical step of splicing. We have further defined the roles 
      of key features of yeast U6 snRNA in the splicing process. By assaying 
      spliceosome assembly and splicing in yeast extracts, we found that mutations of 
      yeast U6 nt 56 and 57 are similar to previously reported deletions of U2 nt 27 or 
      28, all within yeast U2-U6 helix Ia. These mutations lead to the accumulation of 
      yeast A1 spliceosomes, which form just prior to the Prp2 ATPase step and the 
      first chemical step of splicing. These results strongly suggest that, at a late 
      stage of spliceosome assembly, the presence of U2-U6 helix Ia is important for 
      promoting the first chemical step of splicing, presumably by bringing together 
      the 5' splice site region of pre-mRNA, which is base paired to U6 snRNA, and the 
      branchsite region of the intron, which is base paired to U2 snRNA, for activation 
      of the first chemical step of splicing, as previously proposed by Madhani and 
      Guthrie [Cell, 1992, 71: 803-817]. In the 3' intramolecular stem-loop of U6, 
      mutation G81C causes an allele-specific accumulation of U6 snRNP. Base pairing of 
      the U6 3' stem-loop in yeast spliceosomes does not extend as far as to include 
      the U6 sequence of U2-U6 helix Ib, in contrast to the human U6 3' stem-loop 
      structure.

TI  - Participation in health care priority-setting through the eyes of the 
      participants.
PG  - 222-9
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The literature on participation in priority-setting has three key 
      gaps: it focuses on techniques for obtaining public input into priority-setting 
      that are consultative mechanisms and do not involve the public directly in 
      decision-making; it focuses primarily on the public's role in priority-setting, 
      not on all potential participants; and the range of roles that various 
      participants play in a group making priority decisions has not been described. To 
      begin addressing these gaps, we interviewed individuals who participated on two 
      priority-setting committees to identify key insights from participants about 
      participation. METHODS: A qualitative study consisting of interviews with 
      decision-makers, including patients and members of the public. RESULTS: Members 
      of the public can contribute directly to important aspects of priority-setting. 
      The participants described six specific priority-setting roles: committee chair, 
      administrator, medical specialist, medical generalist, public representative and 
      patient representative. They also described the contributions of each role to 
      priority-setting. CONCLUSIONS: Using the insights from decision-makers, we have 
      described lessons related to direct involvement of members of the public and 
      patients in priority-setting, and have identified six roles and the contributions 
      of each role.

TI  - Deliberations about deliberative methods: issues in the design and evaluation of 
      public participation processes.
PG  - 239-51
AB  - A common thread weaving through the current public participation debate is the 
      need for new approaches that emphasize two-way interaction between decision 
      makers and the public as well as deliberation among participants. Increasingly 
      complex decision making processes require a more informed citizenry that has 
      weighed the evidence on the issue, discussed and debated potential decision 
      options and arrived at a mutually agreed upon decision or at least one by which 
      all parties can abide. We explore the recent fascination with deliberative 
      methods for public involvement first by examining their origins within democratic 
      theory, and then by focusing on the experiences with deliberative methods within 
      the health sector. In doing so, we answer the following questions "What are 
      deliberative methods and why have they become so popular? What are their 
      potential contributions to the health sector?" We use this critical review of the 
      literature as the basis for developing general principles that can be used to 
      guide the design and evaluation of public involvement processes for the 
      health-care sector in particular.

TI  - How can research organizations more effectively transfer research knowledge to

PG  - 221-48, 171-2
AB  - Five questions--What should be transferred to decision makers? To whom should it 
      be transferred? By whom? How? With what effect?--provide an organizing framework 
      for a knowledge transfer strategy. Opportunities for improving how research 
      organizations transfer research knowledge can be found in the differences between 
      the answers suggested by our understanding of the research literature and those 
      provided by research-organization directors asked to describe what they do. In 
      Canada, these opportunities include developing actionable messages for decision 
      makers (only 30 percent of research organizations frequently or always do this), 
      developing knowledge-uptake skills in target audiences and knowledge-transfer 
      skills in research organizations (only 20 to 22 percent frequently or always do 
      this), and evaluating the impact of knowledge-transfer activities (only 8 to 12 
      percent frequently or always conduct an evaluation). Research funders can help 
      research organizations take advantage of these opportunities.

TI  - Does deliberation make a difference? Results from a citizens panel study of 
      health goals priority setting.
PG  - 95-106
AB  - How to involve the public in setting health and health care priorities is a 
      constant challenge for health system decisions. Policy maker interest in 
      involving the public in increasingly complex and value-laden priority setting 
      processes has led to the use of deliberative public involvement methods designed 
      to promote discussion and debate among participants with the objective of 
      obtaining more informed and consensual views. These methods have not been 
      evaluated rigorously using controlled designs with pre- and post-test 
      measurements. We examined, using a controlled design, the effects of introducing 
      different opportunities for deliberation into a process for obtaining public 
      input into a community health goals priority setting process. Our findings 
      indicate that deliberation does make a difference to participant views. As more 
      deliberation is introduced, participant views may be more amenable to change. 
      Deliberation also offers the potential for views to become more rather than less 
      entrenched. While we are beginning to understand the difference deliberation 
      makes to participant views, we are still at an early stage in understanding the 
      process through which these differences come about and what difference 
      deliberation makes to broader outcomes such as civic competence, civic engagement 
      and health policy decisions.

TI  - What is important to continuity in home care?. Perspectives of key stakeholders.
PG  - 177-92
AB  - In Canada, home care is growing rapidly. Each province takes a somewhat different 
      approach to its delivery. Ontario uses a competitive bidding model to award 
      contracts to community agencies that bid for service delivery rights. Contracts 
      are to be awarded based on quality and price. However, the attributes thought to 
      contribute to high quality, such as continuity of care, are not clearly defined 
      and are not measured. We sought to identify factors that were important to 
      experiencing continuity of care in home care. We interviewed home care clients 
      and their caregivers, workers in the home care system (nursing and homemaking 
      service providers, case managers) and physicians whose patients use home care. 
      During in-depth interviews with these key stakeholders, they described the 
      conditions that led to continuity of care in home care. Service providers and 
      case managers were also asked about the types of clients who need a high level of 
      care continuity. Care that is experienced as running smoothly, that responds to 
      clients' needs and requires no special effort for clients to maintain, was seen 
      as having continuity. The attributes of care experienced as facilitating 
      continuity could be grouped under two dimensions of care-managing care (care 
      planning, monitoring and review; and care coordination) and direct service 
      provision (uninterrupted service delivery; consistent, appropriate knowledge and 
      skills; ongoing accurate observation; trusting relationship between service 
      provider and client/caregiver; rapport among team members; and consistent 
      timing). Different stakeholders emphasized different attributes of care as most 
      important to continuity. Clients included consistency of timing of service 
      delivery while rarely mentioning care management issues. They emphasized the 
      importance of consistent knowledge and skills in the workers and trusting 
      relationships as important to experiencing care continuity. The description of 
      attributes of continuity of home care that emerged from this study is compared to 
      definitions found in the nursing, mental health and primary care literature.

TI  - ATP requirement for Prp5p function is determined by Cus2p and the structure of U2 
      small nuclear RNA.
PG  - 13857-62
AB  - Stable addition of U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) to form the 
      prespliceosome is the first ATP-dependent step in splicing, and it requires the 
      DEXD/H box ATPase Prp5p. However, prespliceosome formation occurs without ATP in 
      extracts lacking the U2 snRNP protein Cus2p. Here we show that Prp5p is required 
      for the ATP-independent prespliceosome assembly that occurs in the absence of 
      Cus2p. Addition of recombinant Cus2p can restore the ATP dependence of 
      prespliceosome assembly, but only if it is added before Prp5p. Prp5p with an 
      altered ATP-binding domain (Prp5-GNTp) can support growth in vivo, but only in a 
      cus2 deletion strain, mirroring the in vitro results. Other Prp5 ATP-binding 
      domain substitutions are lethal, even in the cus2 deletion strain, but can be 
      suppressed by U2 small nuclear RNA mutations that hyperstabilize U2 stem IIa. We 
      infer that the presence of Cus2p and stem IIa-destabilized forms of U2 small 
      nuclear RNA places high demands on the ATP-driven function of Prp5p. Because 
      Prp5p is not dispensable in vitro even in the absence of ATP, we propose that the 
      core Prp5p function in bringing U2 to the branchpoint is not directly 
      ATP-dependent. The positive role of Cus2p in rescuing mutant U2 can be reconciled 
      with its antagonistic effect on Prp5 function in a model whereby Cus2p first 
      helps Prp5p to activate the U2 snRNP for prespliceosome formation but then is 
      displaced by Prp5p before or during the stabilization of U2 at the branchpoint.

TI  - The policy analysis of 'values talk': lessons from Canadian health reform.
PG  - 15-24
AB  - Despite widespread recognition of the importance of values, decision makers and 
      stakeholders in health policy appear to disagree fundamentally over what 'values' 
      essentially are. Hidden dissent about the nature of values can confuse policy 
      deliberations. This study investigates empirically the following two questions: 
      (1) what sorts of entities do Canadian health reformers typically call 'values'? 
      and; (2) how do Canadian health reformers use the idea of values in health reform 
      rhetoric? We conducted a qualitative, interpretive analysis of 36 Canadian health 
      reform documents published during the period 1990-1999. The values raised in 
      Canadian health reform rhetoric vary widely not only in topic (e.g. health 
      states, health services, equity, economic viability, etc.) but also in substance 
      (e.g. physical entities, goals, principles, attitudes, etc.). We review the 
      diversity of concepts underlying 'values talk' in health policy, and discuss 
      implications for policy analysis and future research.

TI  - Managing under managed community care: the experiences of clients, providers and 
      managers in Ontario's competitive home care sector.
PG  - 359-72
AB  - In 1996, a newly elected government in the Province of Ontario, Canada, 
      introduced a managed competition environment into the home care sector through 
      the establishment of a competitive contracting process for home care services. 
      Through 65 in-depth, semi-structured interviews conducted between November 1999 
      and January 2001, we trace the implementation of this competitive contracting 
      policy within Ontario's newly established managed community care environment and 
      assess the effects of competitive contracting against two sets of goals: (1). 
      quality of care goals that consider continuity of care of paramount importance in 
      the provision of home care; and (2). the managed competition goal of increased 
      efficiency. In assessing the implementation of this policy against these goals, 
      we highlight the conflicts that can arise in pursuing different policy goals in 
      response to different formulations of the policy problem that underpin them. We 
      map stakeholder experiences with the competitive contracting policy onto relevant 
      contracting and managed competition literatures. When measured against the goals 
      of quality of care and efficiency, the findings presented here offer a mixed 
      review of the experiences to date with the competitive contracting process 
      introduced in Ontario's home care sector and suggest improvements for managing 
      future competitive contracting processes.

TI  - Canadians confront health care reform.
PG  - 186-93
AB  - In 2002 Canadians were less anxious about the state of their health care system 
      than they were a few years earlier, when perceptions peaked that the system 
      needed major reform. They expressed strong support in 2002 for maintaining the 
      status quo on health care financing (that is, no user fees and no two-tier care) 
      within the traditional domains of physician and hospital care. But they appeared 
      more receptive to two-tier care and for-profit delivery for the newer and rapidly 
      expanding domains of home care and high-tech care.

TI  - New tertiary constraints between the RNA components of active yeast spliceosomes: 
      a photo-crosslinking study.
PG  - 1251-65
AB  - Elucidation of the three-dimensional (3D) structures of the two sequential active 
      sites in spliceosomes is essential for understanding the mechanism of 
      premessenger RNA splicing. The mechanism is predicted to be catalyzed by the 
      small nuclear RNA (snRNA) components of spliceosomes. To obtain new tertiary 
      constraints between the RNA components, we produced and mapped crosslinks between 
      U6 snRNA and the proximal RNAs of active yeast spliceosomes ("yeast" in this 
      report is Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Thus, specific sites in U6, when substituted 
      with a photoreactive 4-thiouridine or 5-iodouridine, produced 
      spliceosome-dependent crosslinks to U2 snRNA, or in one case, to the pre-mRNA 
      substrate. One set of U2-U6 crosslinks formed before the Prp2p-dependent step of 
      spliceosome assembly, whereas another set formed during or after this step but 
      before the first chemical step of splicing. This latter set of crosslinks formed 
      across U2-U6 helix I. Importantly, this set provides new tertiary constraints for 
      developing 3D models of fully assembled yeast spliceosomes, which are poised for 
      the first chemical step of splicing.

TI  - Clinical calibration of DSM-IV diagnoses in the World Mental Health (WMH) version 
      of the World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic 
      Interview (WMHCIDI).
PG  - 122-39
AB  - An overview is presented of the rationale, design, and analysis plan for the 
      WMH-CIDI clinical calibration studies. As no clinical gold standard assessment is 
      available for the DSM-IV disorders assessed in the WMH-CIDI, we adopted the goal 
      of calibration rather than validation; that is, we asked whether WMH-CIDI 
      diagnoses are 'consistent' with diagnoses based on a state-of-the-art clinical 
      research diagnostic interview (SCID; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) 
      rather than whether they are 'correct'. Consistency is evaluated both at the 
      aggregate level (consistency of WMH-CIDI and SCID prevalence estimates) and at 
      the individual level (consistency of WMH-CIDI and SCID diagnostic 
      classifications). Although conventional statistics (sensitivity, specificity, 
      Cohen's kappa) are used to describe diagnostic consistency, an argument is made 
      for considering the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) to be a more 
      useful general-purpose measure of consistency. In addition, more detailed 
      analyses are used to evaluate consistency on a substantive level. These analyses 
      begin by estimating prediction equations in a clinical calibration subsample, 
      with WMH-CIDI symptom-level data used to predict SCID diagnoses, and using the 
      coefficients from these equations to assign predicted probabilities of SCID 
      diagnoses to each respondent in the remainder of the sample. Substantive analyses 
      then investigate whether estimates of prevalence and associations when based on 
      WMH-CIDI diagnoses are consistent with those based on predicted SCID diagnoses. 
      Multiple imputation is used to adjust estimated standard errors for the 
      imprecision introduced by SCID diagnoses being imputed under a model rather than 
      measured directly. A brief illustration of this approach is presented in 
      comparing the precision of SCID and predicted SCID estimates of prevalence and 
      correlates under varying sample designs.

TI  - Will it make a difference if I show up and share? A citizens' perspective on 
      improving public involvement processes for health system decision-making.
PG  - 205-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Health policy decision-makers are grappling with increasingly 
      complex and ethically controversial decisions at a time when citizens are 
      demanding more involvement in these decision processes. OBJECTIVES: To assess and 
      revise a set of guiding principles for the design of public involvement processes 
      generated from a synthesis of public participation design and evaluation 
      frameworks that can be used to inform the design and evaluation of future public 
      participation processes in the health sector. METHODS: Six focus groups held in 
      five Canadian provinces comprising citizens with considerable experience of 
      public participation processes. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that 
      citizen participants are highly critical of, and discerning about,their public 
      participation experiences. Yet, they are optimistic and determined to contribute 
      in meaningful ways to future public policy processes. They are clear about where 
      improvements are needed and give top priority to what information is shared, and 
      how, among participants and decision-makers. The views of experienced citizens 
      mapped well onto most of the prior principles of public involvement with a few 
      modifications. First, participants gave greater emphasis to the content and 
      balance of information for the purposes of building trust and credibility between 
      citizens and decision-makers. Second, participants viewed themselves, as well as 
      decision-makers, as sources of information to be shared through the consultation 
      process. Finally, participants stressed the importance of getting the information 
      and communication principles right over addressing all other principles.

TI  - Cortisol pulsatility and its role in stress regulation and health.
PG  - 69-76
AB  - One of the classic characteristics of the human stress response is the wide 
      inter-individual variation. Although there is much current interest in the 
      genetic and environmental contributions to these differences, studies on human 
      subject have been sparse and characterised by methodological problems. The major 
      factor that is rarely taken into account is the intrinsic rhythmicity of 
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal activity, not simply the classic diurnal variation 
      but also the endogenous pulsatility which is similar to, but much less well 
      recognized than, the rhythms found within the reproductive and growth hormone 
      axes. In this review we propose some novel ideas relating to the importance of 
      pulsatility both for the design of human stress-response studies and for their 
      interpretation as well as implications for our understanding of disease.

TI  - Family Perceptions of End-of-Life Care in long-term care facilities.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - The study examined the utility of the Family Perception of Care Scale (FPCS), 
      which consists of four subscales: resident care, family support, communication, 
      and rooming. This instrument was developed for the purposes of this study. 
      Overall, family members were satisfied with end-of-life care. Satisfaction did 
      not have a statistically significant relationship to family and resident 
      characteristics. Survey questions with the highest number of low satisfaction 
      ratings included staffing levels, updating families and involving them in care 
      planning, and decision making. Family members considered pain control an 
      important priority, followed by comfort care that included caring for a family 
      member with dignity and sensitivity. Family members also valued it when staff 
      were able to inform them that the death of their family member was near. Place of 
      death was significantly associated with satisfaction, family members being more 
      satisfied with end-of-life care when their family member died in the LTC facility 
      as opposed to in hospital.

TI  - Invasive fungal infections in pediatric oncology patients: 11-year experience at 
      a single institution.
PG  - 135-40
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence of fungal infections in 
      pediatric hematology and oncology (PHO) patients and to describe variations 
      regarding site of infection, organisms, and mortality. The records of 1,052 
      patients presenting to the UCLA PHO service with various malignancies from 1991 
      to 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. No patient received invasive antifungal 
      prophylaxis. Transplant patients were excluded. The 11-year incidence of fungal 
      infections in this pediatric oncology cohort was 4.9%. There was a linear 
      increase in the incidence of fungal infections from 2.9% to 7.8% between 1996 and 
      2001 (P = 0.001). Patients with acute leukemia represented 36% of the population 
      but had a disproportionate incidence (67%) of fungal infections. Adolescents had 
      twice the expected incidence of infection (P < 0.0001). Overall, Candida sp. was 
      the major pathogen. Over time, a trend of fewer infections caused by Candida and 
      more due to Aspergillus was noted. Blood-borne infections decreased over time, 
      while those in the urinary and respiratory tracts increased (P = 0.04). Sixty-two 
      percent of infections occurred in neutropenic patients. PHO patients had an 
      overall mortality of 21%, but those with fungal infections experienced a 2.6-fold 
      higher mortality that was not attributable to infections alone. Empiric 
      antifungal therapy had no effect on mortality rates. Concurrent nonfungal 
      infections did not increase mortality rates. The incidence of fungal infections 
      increased over time, possibly as a result of advances in antibacterial and 
      chemotherapeutic regimens. Adolescents and patients with leukemia were especially 
      at risk. Fungal infections are a poor prognostic factor, independent of 
      fungal-related mortality. New diagnostic methods allowing for early detection and 
      treatment as well as more effective therapies are needed.

TI  - Research use in children's mental health policy in Canada: maintaining vigilance 
      amid ambiguity.
PG  - 1649-57
AB  - Many researchers hope to see the best available research evidence used in 
      policy-making to address important public problems. However, policy often appears 
      to be based on anything but the research evidence, as the problem of conduct 
      disorder (or severe antisocial behaviour in children) shows. In Canada, few 
      children receive effective prevention or treatment programs, and incarceration is 
      overused, despite evidence that it is ineffective and potentially harmful. Using 
      the example of conduct disorder, we investigated why policy-making has not 
      reflected the research evidence, examining research use in the context of 
      competing influences on the policy process. Qualitative methods were used to 
      analyze data from interviews with thirty-two politicians and senior civil 
      servants. Our allegiance to rationality wavered as we listened to policy-makers 
      who contended with the inherent ambiguity in the policy process. They told us 
      that they managed institutional constraints including fragmentation across levels 
      and sectors of government, and the long-term effects of fiscal restraint. They 
      also reconciled the competing interests of stakeholders' priorities, the public's 
      response to negative events involving children and the media's role in shaping 
      this response. Ideas about youth violence were morally charged, but policy-makers 
      remained committed to improving children's lives. Day-to-day, policy-makers 
      obtained most of their information internally and informally. Research evidence 
      was valued and used, but as just one source of ideas and information among many. 
      In this environment of ambiguity, creative civil servants formed partnerships 
      with trusted researchers in order to change policy. Our findings suggest that the 
      use of research evidence in policy-making could be enhanced if researchers 
      learned about the competing influences on the policy process, formed 
      research-policy partnerships, challenged the incentives within research 
      institutions, and engaged in public debates about important problems, such as 
      child antisocial behaviour.

TI  - From rhetoric to reality: including patient voices in supportive cancer care 
      planning.
PG  - 195-209
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the extent and manner of patient participation in the 
      planning of regional supportive care networks throughout the province of Ontario. 
      We consider the disconnect between the rhetoric and reality of patient 
      involvement in network planning and co-ordination. CONTEXT: In 1997, the Province 
      of Ontario, Canada, established a new, regionalized cancer care system. By 
      transferring responsibility to the regional level and to networks, the architects 
      of the new provincial system hoped to broaden participation in decision making 
      and to enhance the responsiveness of decisions to communities. RESEARCH APPROACH: 
      Through a qualitative, multiple case study approach we evaluated the processes of 
      involving patients in network development. In-depth, semi-structured interviews 
      and document analysis were complemented by observations of provincial meetings, 
      regional council and network meetings. RESULTS: The network development processes 
      in the three case study regions reveal a significant gap between intentions to 
      involve patients in health planning and their actual involvement. This gap can be 
      explained by: (i) a lack of clear direction regarding networks and patient 
      participation in these networks; (ii) the dominance of regional cancer centres in 
      network planning activities; and, (iii) the emergence of competing provincial 
      priorities. DISCUSSION: These three trends expose the complexity of the notion of 
      public participation and how it is embedded in social and political contexts. The 
      failed attempt at involving patients in health planning efforts is the result of 
      benign neglect of public participation intents and the social and political 
      contexts in which public and patient participation is meant to occur.

TI  - Are we expecting too much from print media? An analysis of newspaper coverage of 
      the 2002 Canadian healthcare reform debate.
PG  - 89-102
AB  - News media effects on their audiences are complex. Four commonly cited effects 
      are: informing audiences; agenda-setting; framing; and persuading. The release in 
      autumn 2002 of two reports on options for reforming Canada's healthcare system 
      attracted widespread media attention. We explored the potential for each of the 
      four media effects by examining Canadian newspaper representation of this 
      healthcare policy debate. Clippings were gathered from regional and national 
      newspapers. Two data collection methodologies were employed: the first involved 
      two staggered "constructed weeks" designed to capture thematic news framing 
      styles; the second collected "intensive" or episodic coverage immediately 
      following the report releases. Health reform articles with a financing and/or 
      delivery focus were included. Using a codebook, articles were coded to track 
      article characteristics, tone, healthcare sector and reform themes, and key 
      actors. A greater quantity of episodic (n=341 clippings) versus thematic coverage 
      (n=77) was documented. Coverage type did not vary significantly by newspaper, 
      reporting source (e.g., staff reporter versus staff editorialist) or article type 
      (e.g., news versus letter). Thematic articles were significantly shorter in 
      length compared to episodic clippings. Episodic coverage tended to have a 
      positive tone, while thematic coverage ranged in tone. Most coverage was general 
      in scope. Sector-specific coverage favoured physician and hospital care--the two 
      providers accorded privileged financing arrangements under Canada's universal, 
      provincially administered health-insurance plans. Coverage of healthcare 
      financing arrangements favoured broad discussions of publicly financed 
      healthcare, federal-provincial governmental relations, and the Canada Health Act 
      that governs provincial plans. Governmental actors and the political institutions 
      that they represent were the dominant actors. Professional associations were also 
      visible, but played a less dominant role. Given its non-specific scope, it is 
      unclear how informative this coverage was. The large quantity and short duration 
      of the episodic coverage, and the preponderance of governmental actors, suggests 
      these newspapers acted as conduits for the policy agenda. Differences in framing 
      styles were observed by coverage type, newspaper, reporting source, article 
      length and type of article. Finally, the dominance of governmental actors 
      provided these actors with numerous opportunities to persuade the public.

TI  - Some characteristics of early-onset injection drug users prior to and at the time 
      of their first injection.
PG  - 548-55
AB  - AIMS: This paper examines differences between early- and late-onset injection 
      drug users (12-16 years versus 17-24 years) in terms of the antecedents and 
      circumstances of first injection. DESIGN: Cross-sectional retrospective design, 
      using logistic regression. Setting Australia: Sydney, Brisbane, rural New South 
      Wales. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 336 injection drug users aged 16-25 years at the 
      time of interview. MEASUREMENTS: Independent variables included family injection 
      drug use, homelessness and other demographic variables, drugs used prior to the 
      first injection, length of pre-injection drug career, behaviours at time of first 
      injection (e.g. drug injected, reasons/motives for the first injection, risk 
      behaviours). FINDINGS: Early-onset injection was associated independently with: 
      having a family who injected drugs, having left school early, an unreliable 
      source of income, a short pre-injection drug career, planning of the first 
      injection, reliance on others for administration of the first injection and 
      denial that experimentation was the motive for the first injection. In bivariate 
      analysis, early-onset injection was associated further with: homelessness, being 
      an Indigenous Australian, omission of use of certain pre-injection drugs, group 
      presence at first injection, reliance on others for acquisition of the first 
      needle and syringe and having injected the first time because an injection was 
      offered. CONCLUSIONS: The research shows that early-onset, compared with 
      late-onset injectors, are more likely to have an immediate family who inject 
      drugs and other problematic beginnings in early life. They have an accelerated 
      transition to injection, and differences in autonomy and motivation at first 
      injection. These characteristics may make them more vulnerable to risk taking.

TI  - Knowledge into action? understanding ideological barriers to addressing health 
      inequalities at the local level.
PG  - 158-71
AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the presence of ideological barriers 
      to addressing local health inequalities in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A survey of 
      active citizens revealed low levels of awareness of the social determinants of 
      health (SDOH) framework, and some incongruence between understanding and 
      attitudes towards the SDOH. Support for addressing health inequalities was 
      associated with awareness of the SDOH framework, liberal value-systems, and a 
      cluster of socio-demographic characteristics. Liberal leaning participants were 
      also more politically active than their conservative counterparts. Ideological 
      barriers included lack of SDOH awareness, narrow understandings of the relative 
      influences of the SDOH, resistance to de-prioritizing healthcare, and 
      conservative values. Advancement of a SDOH policy agenda should incorporate wider 
      dissemination efforts to citizens and local service providers to increase support 
      for this framework, and utilization of existing support and political engagement 
      from liberal-leaning demographics.

TI  - Factors associated with 'feeling suicidal': the role of sexual identity.
PG  - 59-80
AB  - This paper examines factors associated with feeling suicidal in a large sample of 
      urban men in Sydney and Melbourne, aged 18-50, including heterosexual, gay and 
      bisexual men, HIV antibody positive and HIV antibody negative. As in previous 
      research, sexuality (being homosexual or bisexual) was found to be a major 
      predictor of suicidality. The research went some way towards explaining the close 
      relationship between feeling suicidal and sexual orientation. Sexuality interacts 
      with feeling bad in that, once men feel moderately bad/depressed, they are more 
      likely to feel suicidal if they are homosexual or bisexual than if they are 
      heterosexual. In addition, the research found that experience of verbal abuse and 
      physical assault (harassment) increased feeling suicidal for both heterosexual 
      and gay/bisexual men, not just for homosexual men as suggested by previous 
      research, and that social isolation in the form of living alone is a further risk 
      factor. Seeking counseling help and taking sexual risks were also independently 
      associated with feeling suicidal. These actions may result from feeling suicidal 
      rather than the reverse, and their association with feeling suicidal warrants 
      further research. Many of the 46 independent variables examined in the research, 
      including HIV antibody status and closeness to the HIV/ AIDS epidemic, were 
      related to feeling suicidal only through their association with being 
      gay/bisexual. Celibacy and general risk taking were not related to feeling 
      suicidal in this study.

TI  - Bringing 'the public' into health technology assessment and coverage policy 
      decisions: from principles to practice.
PG  - 37-50
AB  - Those making health care coverage decisions rely on health technology assessment 
      (HTA) for crucial technical information. But coverage decision-making, and the 
      HTA that informs it, are also inherently political. They involve the values and 
      judgments of a range of stakeholders as well as the public. Moreover, governments 
      are politically accountable for their resource allocation decisions. Canadian 
      policy makers are at an early stage in the design of legitimate mechanisms for 
      the public to contribute to, and to be apprised of, HTA and coverage decisions. 
      As they consider the options, questions arise about whom to involve (e.g., which 
      publics), how to engage them (e.g., through what public involvement or 
      accountability mechanisms), and for what purpose (e.g., to inform the public of 
      decisions and their rationales, or to have the public directly affect those 
      decisions). Often key concepts, such as the difference between public 
      accountability and public participation, are not well articulated or 
      distinguished in these debates. Guidance is needed regarding both rationales and 
      methods for involving the public in HTA and technology coverage decisions. We 
      offer a framework that clearly distinguishes specific roles for the public, and 
      relates them to several layers of policy analysis and policy making where 'the 
      public' may engage in different tasks. The framework offers a menu of choices for 
      policy makers contemplating changes to public involvement, as well as a model 
      that can be used to characterize and analyze different approaches across 
      jurisdictions.

TI  - Examining the role of context in the implementation of a deliberative public 
      participation experiment: results from a Canadian comparative study.
PG  - 2115-28
AB  - To resolve tensions among competing sources of evidence and public expectations, 
      health-care managers and policy makers are turning more than ever to involve the 
      public in a wide range of decisions. Yet efforts to use research evidence to 
      inform public involvement decisions are hampered by an absence of rigorous public 
      participation evaluation research. In particular, greater rigour in exploring the 
      roles played by different contextual variables--such as characteristics of the 
      issue of interest, the culture of the sponsoring organization and attributes of 
      the decision being made--is needed. Using a comparative quasi-experimental 
      design, we assessed the performance of a generic public participation method 
      implemented in 5 Canadian regionalized health settings between 2001 and 2004. 
      Participant and decision-maker perspectives were assessed and, through direct 
      observation, the roles exerted by contextual variables over the public 
      involvement processes were documented and analysed. Our findings demonstrate that 
      a generic public participation method can be implemented in a variety of contexts 
      and with considerable success. Context exerts fostering and inhibiting influences 
      that contribute to more (or less) successful implementation. Public participation 
      practitioners are encouraged to pay careful attention to the types of issues and 
      decisions for which they are seeking public input. Sufficient organizational 
      resources and commitment to the goals of the public participation process are 
      also required. Attention to these contextual attributes and their influence on 
      the design and outcomes of public participation processes is as important as 
      choosing the "right" public participation mechanism.

TI  - Alternatives to project-specific consent for access to personal information for 
      health research: what is the opinion of the Canadian public?
PG  - 706-12
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine public opinion on alternatives to 
      project-specific consent for use of their personal information for health 
      research. DESIGN: The authors conducted a fixed-response random-digit dialed 
      telephone survey of 1,230 adults across Canada. MEASUREMENTS: We measured 
      attitudes toward privacy and health research; trust in different institutions to 
      keep information confidential; and consent choice for research use of one's own 
      health information involving medical record review, automated abstraction of 
      information from the electronic medical record, and linking education or income 
      with health data. RESULTS: Support was strong for both health research and 
      privacy protection. Studying communicable diseases and quality of health care had 
      greatest support (85% to 89%). Trust was highest for data institutes, university 
      researchers, hospitals, and disease foundations (78% to 80%). Four percent of 
      respondents thought information from their paper medical record should not be 
      used at all for research, 32% thought permission should be obtained for each use, 
      29% supported broad consent, 24% supported notification and opt out, and 11% felt 
      no need for notification or consent. Opinions were more polarized for automated 
      abstraction of data from the electronic medical record. Respondents were more 
      willing to link education with health data than income. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the 
      public supported alternatives to study-specific consent, but few supported use 
      without any notification or consent. Consent choices for research use of one's 
      health information should be documented in the medical record. The challenge 
      remains how best to elicit those choices and ensure that they are up-to-date.

TI  - Cell-free circularization of viroid progeny RNA by an RNA ligase from wheat germ.
PG  - 1147-9
AB  - Linear, potato spindle tuber viroid RNA has been used as a substrate for an RNA 
      ligase purified from wheat germ. Linear viroid molecules are efficiently 
      converted to circular molecules (circles) which are indistinguishable by 
      electrophoretic mobility and two-dimensional oligonucleotide pattern from viroid 
      circles extracted from infected plants. In light of recent evidence for 
      multimeric viroid replication intermediates, cleavage followed by RNA ligation by 
      a cellular enzyme may (i) be a normal step in the viroid life cycle and (ii) may 
      also reflect cellular events.

TI  - Mental health service delivery in Ontario, Canada: how do policy legacies shape 
      prospects for reform?
PG  - 363-89
LID - 10.1017/S1744133107004318 [doi]
AB  - Like many jurisdictions, mental health policy-making in Ontario, Canada, has a 
      long history of frustrated attempts to move from a hospital and physician-based 
      tradition to a coordinated system with greater emphasis on community-based mental 
      health care. This study examines policy legacies associated with the introduction 
      of psychiatric hospitals in the 1850s and of public health insurance (medicare) 
      in the 1960s in Ontario; and their effect on subsequent mental health reform 
      initiatives using a qualitative case study approach. Following Pierson (1993) we 
      capture the resource/incentive and interpretive effects of prior policies on 
      three groups of actors: government elites, interests, and mass publics. Data are 
      drawn from academic and policy literature, and key informant interviews. The 
      findings suggest that psychiatric hospital policy produced important policy 
      legacies which were reinforced by the establishment of Canadian medicare. These 
      legacies explain the traditional difficulty in achieving mental health reform, 
      but are less helpful in explaining recent promising developments that support 
      community-based care. Current reform of the Ontario health system presents an 
      opportunity to overcome several of these legacies. Analysis of policy legacies in 
      other countries which had an asylum tradition may help to explain the 
      similarities and differences in their subsequent paths of mental health reform.

TI  - Alternatives to project-specific consent for access to personal information for 
      health research: insights from a public dialogue.
PG  - 18
LID - 10.1186/1472-6939-9-18 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of consent for research use of health information is 
      contentious. Most discussion has focused on when project-specific consent may be 
      waived but, recently, a broader range of consent options has been entertained, 
      including broad opt-in for multiple studies with restrictions and notification 
      with opt-out. We sought to elicit public values in this matter and to work toward 
      an agreement about a common approach to consent for use of personal information 
      for health research through deliberative public dialogues. METHODS: We conducted 
      seven day-long public dialogues, involving 98 participants across Canada. 
      Immediately before and after each dialogue, participants completed a 
      fixed-response questionnaire rating individuals' support for 3 approaches to 
      consent in the abstract and their consent choices for 5 health research scenarios 
      using personal information. They also rated how confident different safeguards 
      made them feel that their information was being used responsibly. RESULTS: Broad 
      opt-in consent for use of personal information garnered the greatest support in 
      the abstract. When presented with specific research scenarios, no one approach to 
      consent predominated. When profit was introduced into the scenarios, consent 
      choices shifted toward greater control over use. Despite lively and constructive 
      dialogues, and considerable shifting in opinion at the individual level, at the 
      end of the day, there was no substantive aggregate movement in opinion. Personal 
      controls were among the most commonly cited approaches to improving people's 
      confidence in the responsible use of their information for research. CONCLUSION: 
      Because no one approach to consent satisfied even a simple majority of dialogue 
      participants and the importance placed on personal controls, a mechanism should 
      be developed for documenting consent choice for different types of research, 
      including ways for individuals to check who has accessed their medical record for 
      purposes other than clinical care. This could be done, for example, through a 
      web-based patient portal to their electronic health record. Researchers and 
      policy makers should continue to engage the public to promote greater public 
      understanding of the research process and to look for feasible alternatives to 
      existing approaches to project-specific consent for observational research.

TI  - What does it mean to trust a health system? A qualitative study of Canadian 
      health care values.
PG  - 63-70
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2008.11.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We used a qualitative empirical study of Canadians' values toward 
      their health system to develop more meaningful conceptualizations of trust and 
      health systems that can inform the pursuit of more trustworthy health systems. 
      METHODS: We convened nine focus groups in three Canadian cities in 2002 and 2004 
      in conjunction with a national public opinion telephone survey of Canadians' 
      attitudes and values toward their health system. Health system trust emerged as a 
      significant theme in focus group discussions and was investigated using a 
      modified grounded theory approach. FINDINGS: Respondents construct cleavages and 
      alliances to position themselves in relation to different features of the trusted 
      health system. The health system and Canadian Medicare are identified sources of 
      trust just as are individual health care providers. Core to the trust 
      relationship is the experience of vulnerability which provides the impetus for 
      placing trust (in providers, governments and health systems) or seeds distrust, 
      mistrust and resilience in the same. CONCLUSIONS: We offer a more robust 
      conceptualization of what it means to trust a health system. Policy maker efforts 
      to intervene to restore lost trust could usefully be informed by these findings.

TI  - Public participation in health care priority setting: A scoping review.
PG  - 219-28
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2009.01.005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While much literature has debated public engagement in health care 
      decision-making, there is no consensus on when public engagement should be sought 
      and how it should be obtained. We conducted a scoping review to examine public 
      engagement in one specific area: priority setting and resource allocation. 
      METHOD: The review drew upon a broad range of health and non-health literature in 
      an attempt to elicit what is known and not known on this topic, and through this 
      to outline any guidance to assist decision-makers and identify where efforts for 
      future research should be directed. RESULTS: Governments appear to recognize 
      benefits in consulting multiple publics using a range of methods, though more 
      traditional approaches to engagement continue to predominate. There appears to be 
      growing interest in deliberative approaches to public engagement, which are more 
      commonly on-going rather than one-off and more apt to involve face-to-face 
      contact. However, formal evaluation of public engagement efforts is rare. Also 
      absent is any real effort to demonstrate how public views might be integrated 
      with other decision inputs when allocating social resources. CONCLUSION: While 
      some strands can be taken to inform current priority setting activity, this 
      scoping review identified many gaps and highlights numerous areas for further 
      research.

TI  - Joining the conversation: newspaper journalists' views on working with 
      researchers.
PG  - 123-39
AB  - For health researchers who seek more research use in policy making to improve 
      health and healthcare, working with the news media may represent an opportunity, 
      given the media's pivotal role in public policy agenda-setting. Much literature 
      on science and health journalism assumes a normative stance, focusing on 
      improving the accuracy of news coverage. In this study, we investigated 
      journalists' perspectives and experiences. We were particularly interested in 
      learning how health researchers could work constructively with journalists as a 
      means to increase research use in policy making. Qualitative methods were used to 
      conduct and analyze interviews with experienced newspaper journalists across 
      Canada, with children's mental health as a content example. In response, study 
      participants emphasized journalistic processes more than the content of news 
      coverage, whether children's mental health or other topics. Instead, they focused 
      on what they thought researchers needed to know about journalists' roles, 
      practices and views on working with researchers. Newspaper journalists balance 
      business and social responsibilities according to their respective roles as 
      editors, columnists and reporters. In practice, journalists must ensure 
      newsworthiness, relevance to readers and access to sources in a context of daily 
      deadlines. As generalists, journalists rely on researchers to be expert 
      interpreters, although they find many researchers unavailable or unable to 
      communicate with public audiences. While journalists are skeptical about such 
      common organizational communications tools as news releases, they welcome the 
      uncommon contributions of those researchers who cultivate relationships and 
      invest time to synthesize and communicate research evidence on an ongoing basis. 
      Some appealed for more researchers to join them in participating in public 
      conversations. We conclude that there are opportunities for policy-oriented 
      health researchers to work constructively with newspaper journalists--by 
      appreciating journalists' perspectives and by taking seriously some of their 
      suggestions for engaging in public conversations--and that such engagement can be 
      a means to increase the use of research evidence in policy making and thereby 
      improve health and healthcare.

TI  - Media Hyping and the "Herceptin Access Story": An Analysis of Canadian and UK 
      Newspaper Coverage.
PG  - e113-28
AB  - In May 2005, preliminary trial results pronouncing the effectiveness of Herceptin 
      (trastuzumab) for treatment of early-stage breast cancer were disseminated at a 
      high-profile scientific meeting. Herceptin was subsequently approved for use in 
      the public healthcare systems of Canada and the United Kingdom, although the 
      differences between the two decision timelines were stark. The authors compared 
      UK and Canadian newspaper coverage of the Herceptin story to assess how it may 
      have been "hyped" in each country. They analyzed a diverse sample of newspapers 
      and coded clippings for reporters' framing of the drug's efficacy, costs and 
      funding approval process. Canadian news coverage preceded formal publication of 
      the trial results, while UK coverage mirrored major national events. Reporters in 
      both countries used predominantly individualistic perspectives and framed 
      Herceptin's efficacy in salutary terms. Framing of costs was more neutral in 
      Canadian than in UK newspapers. Funding approval framing focused on inequitable 
      access in the UK and timeliness in Canada. News coverage of drug access stories 
      varies across jurisdictions in terms of intensity and some aspects of framing. 
      Such variations likely reflect different journalistic practices and dominant 
      political rhetoric. Greater attention should be given to the role that news 
      coverage of drug access plays in shaping public opinion and policy action, 
      especially when this coverage precedes scientific debate.

TI  - "It all depends": conceptualizing public involvement in the context of health 
      technology assessment agencies.
PG  - 1518-26
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2010.01.036 [doi]
AB  - There have been calls in recent years for greater public involvement in health 
      technology assessment (HTA). Yet the concept of public involvement is poorly 
      articulated and little attention has been paid to the context of HTA agencies. 
      This article investigates how public involvement is conceptualized in the HTA 
      agency environment. Using qualitative concept analysis methods, we reviewed the 
      HTA literature and the websites of HTA agencies and conducted semi-structured 
      interviews with informants in Canada, Denmark, and the United Kingdom. Our 
      analysis reveals that HTA agencies' role as bridges or boundary organizations 
      situated at the frontier of research and policymaking causes the agencies to 
      struggle with the idea of public involvement. The HTA community is concerned with 
      conceptualizing public involvement in such a way as to meet scientific and 
      methodological standards without neglecting its responsibilities to healthcare 
      policymakers. We offer a conceptual tool for analyzing the nature of public 
      involvement across agencies, characterizing different domains, levels of 
      involvement, and types of publics.

TI  - Conformational dynamics of single pre-mRNA molecules during in vitro splicing.
PG  - 504-12
LID - 10.1038/nsmb.1767 [doi]
AB  - The spliceosome is a complex small nuclear RNA (snRNA)-protein machine that 
      removes introns from pre-mRNAs via two successive phosphoryl transfer reactions. 
      The chemical steps are isoenergetic, yet splicing requires at least eight 
      RNA-dependent ATPases responsible for substantial conformational rearrangements. 
      To comprehensively monitor pre-mRNA conformational dynamics, we developed a 
      strategy for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) that uses a small, efficiently spliced 
      yeast pre-mRNA, Ubc4, in which donor and acceptor fluorophores are placed in the 
      exons adjacent to the 5' and 3' splice sites. During splicing in vitro, we 
      observed a multitude of generally reversible time- and ATP-dependent 
      conformational transitions of individual pre-mRNAs. The conformational dynamics 
      of branchpoint and 3'-splice site mutants differ from one another and from wild 
      type. Because all transitions are reversible, spliceosome assembly appears to be 
      occurring close to thermal equilibrium.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is more prevalent in perinatal than general 
      samples of women (6-8% vs. 4-5%). To explore potential causes, we examined the 
      symptom profiles of women belonging to two separate samples: a perinatal clinic 
      sample (n = 1581) and a subsample of women in a similar age range from the U. S. 
      National Women's Study (NWS) (n = 2000). Within the perinatal sample, risk ratios 
      were higher for all 17 PTSD symptoms among women with current PTSD compared with 
      unaffected women, suggesting that higher rates are not likely due to measurement 
      error. The younger age and greater social disadvantage in the perinatal clinic 
      sample contributed only a small proportion of variance in symptom levels compared 
      with extent of trauma exposure and pre-existing PTSD. Compared with the national 
      study sample's symptom profile, the perinatal sample had higher rates of 
      occurrence of five symptoms: detachment, loss of interest, anger and 
      irritability, trouble sleeping, and nightmares. This analysis confirms that PTSD 
      rates are higher in perinatal samples, which is likely due to exacerbation of 
      pre-existing PTSD among women of a younger age and greater social disadvantage. 
      Further elucidation is warranted, including identifying triggers and determining 
      if there are needs for pregnancy-specific interventions.

AB  - The spliceosome is a complex small nuclear (sn)RNA-protein machine that removes 
      introns from pre-mRNAs via two successive phosphoryl transfer reactions. For each 
      splicing event, the spliceosome is assembled de novo on a pre-mRNA substrate and 
      a complex series of assembly steps leads to the active conformation. To 
      comprehensively monitor pre-mRNA conformational dynamics during spliceosome 
      assembly, we developed a strategy for single-molecule FRET (smFRET) that utilizes 
      a small, efficiently spliced yeast pre-mRNA, Ubc4, in which donor and acceptor 
      fluorophores are placed in the exons adjacent to the 5' and 3' splice sites. In 
      this chapter, we describe the identification of Ubc4 pre-mRNA that is efficiently 
      spliced in vitro and the methods we have developed for the chemical synthesis of 
      fluorescent Ubc4 pre-mRNA for smFRET.

TI  - Development of a framework for effective community engagement in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 59-69
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2010.08.024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to: (1) conceptualize effective community engagement 
      (CE) within the Local Health Integration Networks (LHIN) of Ontario, Canada, (2) 
      develop an effective CE framework and (3) compare the CE framework to public 
      engagement (PE) frameworks and assess their relevance to the LHIN context. 
      METHODS: We implemented "concept mapping," a participatory, mixed-methods 
      approach, with LHIN staff. The method includes three components: (1) 
      "Brainstorming" where participants generated statements describing effective CE; 
      (2) "Sorting and Rating" where participants grouped statements and rated their 
      relative importance to generate a "cluster map" and (3) "Mapping" where 
      participants reviewed and named the clusters to yield the effective CE framework. 
      RESULTS: Staff generated a list of 64 statements. Participants reviewed the 
      cluster map to generate six categories for the framework: (1) collaboration, (2) 
      accessibility, (3) accountability, (4) education, (5) principles and (6) 
      organizational capacity. CONCLUSIONS: The effective CE framework overlaps with PE 
      frameworks with two caveats. First, applications of PE evaluation frameworks to 
      the LHINs may yield incomplete results given that partnerships with service 
      providers and organizations are integral to CE strategies. Second, 
      "organizational capacity," largely not captured within existing frameworks, must 
      be integrated as a feature given that emerging research identifies its importance 
      to the successful implementation of engagement strategies.

TI  - The integration of citizens into a science/policy network in genetics: governance 
      arrangements and asymmetry in expertise.
PG  - 261-71
LID - 10.1111/j.1369-7625.2010.00636.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE While there are increasing calls for public input into health research 
      and policy, the actual obtaining of such input faces many challenges in practice. 
      This article examines how a Canadian science/policy network in the field of 
      genetics integrated citizens into its structure and then managed their 
      participation. METHODS Our ethnographic case study covers a 5-year period 
      (2003-08) and combines four data sources: observations of the network's meetings 
      and informal activities, debriefing sessions with the network's leaders, 
      semi-structured interviews with network members (n = 20) and document analysis. 
      RESULTS When setting up the network, the leaders wanted to include a range of 
      perspectives (research, clinical and policy) to increase the relevance of their 
      research production and knowledge-transfer activities. After 2 years of 
      operation, the network's members agreed to also include citizens who were not 
      knowledgeable in genetics and policy issues. As neither the structure nor the 
      dynamics of the network were modified, the citizens very soon started to feel 
      uncomfortable with their role. They doubted the relevance of their contribution, 
      pointing to an asymmetry in knowledge between them and the expert members. There 
      were significant tensions in the network's governance and the citizens' concerns 
      during the process were not fully addressed. CONCLUSION The integration of 
      citizens into transdisciplinary networks requires recognizing and addressing the 
      asymmetry of expertise that underpins such a collaborative endeavour. It also 
      requires understanding that citizens may feel uncomfortable adopting the 
      pre-defined role ascribed to them, may need a space of their own or may even 
      withdraw if they feel being used.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study explores the factors that enhance or reduce the prospects 
      for public involvement in the activities of health technology assessment (HTA) 
      agencies. METHODS: The analytical framework for this study is based on the work 
      of John W. Kingdon, which provides a comprehensive synthesis of the factors 
      influencing governments and public organizations' agenda. The study draws 
      insights from forty-two semistructured telephone interviews with informants 
      involved in international HTA networks and/or in HTA agencies in Canada, Denmark, 
      and the United Kingdom. RESULTS: This exploratory study suggests that the HTA 
      community is moving toward greater public involvement. However, the HTA community 
      remains cautious and ambivalent about the technical feasibility of public 
      involvement, its acceptability to policy makers and practitioners, and its 
      impacts on HTA agencies' resources and procedures. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      stresses the importance of conducting rigorous and compelling evaluations to 
      inform HTA agencies' decision to adopt, or reject, public involvement practices.

TI  - Advanced practice nursing in Canada: overview of a decision support synthesis.
PG  - 15-34
AB  - The objective of this decision support synthesis was to identify and review 
      published and grey literature and to conduct stakeholder interviews to (1) 
      describe the distinguishing characteristics of clinical nurse specialist (CNS) 
      and nurse practitioner (NP) role definitions and competencies relevant to 
      Canadian contexts, (2) identify the key barriers and facilitators for the 
      effective development and utilization of CNS and NP roles and (3) inform the 
      development of evidence-based recommendations for the individual, organizational 
      and system supports required to better integrate CNS and NP roles into the 
      Canadian healthcare system and advance the delivery of nursing and patient care 
      services in Canada. Four types of advanced practice nurses (APNs) were the focus: 
      CNSs, primary healthcare nurse practitioners (PHCNPs), acute care nurse 
      practitioners (ACNPs) and a blended CNS/NP role. We worked with a 
      multidisciplinary, multijurisdictional advisory board that helped identify 
      documents and key informant interviewees, develop interview questions and 
      formulate implications from our findings. We included 468 published and 
      unpublished English- and French-language papers in a scoping review of the 
      literature. We conducted interviews in English and French with 62 Canadian and 
      international key informants (APNs, healthcare administrators, policy makers, 
      nursing regulators, educators, physicians and other team members). We conducted 
      four focus groups with a total of 19 APNs, educators, administrators and policy 
      makers. A multidisciplinary roundtable convened by the Canadian Health Services 
      Research Foundation formulated evidence-informed policy and practice 
      recommendations based on the synthesis findings. This paper forms the foundation 
      for this special issue, which contains 10 papers summarizing different dimensions 
      of our synthesis. Here, we summarize the synthesis methods and the 
      recommendations formulated at the roundtable.

TI  - Factors enabling advanced practice nursing role integration in Canada.
PG  - 211-38
AB  - Although advanced practice nurses (APNs) have existed in Canada for over 40 years 
      and there is abundant evidence of their safety and effectiveness, their full 
      integration into our healthcare system has not been fully realized. For this 
      paper, we drew on pertinent sections of a scoping review of the Canadian 
      literature from 1990 onward and interviews or focus groups with 81 key informants 
      conducted for a decision support synthesis on advanced practice nursing to 
      identify the factors that enable role development and implementation across the 
      three types of APNs: clinical nurse specialists, primary healthcare nurse 
      practitioners and acute care nurse practitioners. For development of advanced 
      practice nursing roles, many of the enabling factors occur at the 
      federal/provincial/territorial (F/P/T) level. They include utilization of a 
      pan-Canadian approach, provision of high-quality education, and development of 
      appropriate legislative and regulatory mechanisms. Systematic planning to guide 
      role development is needed at both the F/P/T and organizational levels. For 
      implementation of advanced practice nursing roles, some of the enabling factors 
      require action at the F/P/T level. They include recruitment and retention, role 
      funding, intra-professional relations between clinical nurse specialists and 
      nurse practitioners, public awareness, national leadership support and role 
      evaluation. Factors requiring action at the level of the organization include 
      role clarity, healthcare setting support, implementation of all role components 
      and continuing education. Finally, inter-professional relations require action at 
      both the F/P/T and organizational levels. A multidisciplinary roundtable 
      formulated policy and practice recommendations based on the synthesis findings,

TI  - Utilization of nurse practitioners to increase patient access to primary 
      healthcare in Canada--thinking outside the box.
PG  - 239-59
AB  - In the past decade, all Canadian provinces and territories have launched various 
      team-based primary healthcare initiatives designed to improve access and 
      continuity of care. Nurse practitioners (NPs) are increasingly becoming integral 
      members of primary healthcare teams across the country. This paper draws on the 
      results of a scoping review of the literature and qualitative key informant 
      interviews conducted for a decision support synthesis about advanced practice 
      nursing in Canada. We describe and analyze two novel approaches to NP integration 
      designed to address the gap in patient access to primary healthcare: (1) the 
      integration of NPs in traditional fee-for-service practices in British Columbia, 
      and (2) the creation of NP-led clinics in Ontario. Although fee-for-service 
      remuneration has been a barrier to collaborative practice, the integration of 
      government-salaried NPs into fee-for-service practices in British Columbia has 
      enabled the creation of inter-professional teams, and based on early evaluation 
      findings, has increased patient access to care and patient and provider 
      satisfaction. NP-led clinics are designed to provide inter-professional care in 
      communities with high numbers of patients who do not have a regular primary 
      healthcare provider. Given the shortage of physicians in communities where these 
      clinics are being introduced, the ratio of physicians to NPs is lower than in 
      other primary healthcare delivery models, and physicians function in more of a 
      consulting role. Initial evaluation of the first of 26 NP-led clinics indicates 
      increased access to care and high levels of patient and provider satisfaction. 
      Implementing a creative mosaic of collaborative primary healthcare models that 
      are responsive to patient needs challenges traditional assumptions about 
      professional roles and responsibilities. To address this challenge, we endorse a 
      recommendation that governments establish a mechanism to bring together both 
      physician and non-physician primary healthcare providers to advise on primary 
      healthcare policy development and implementation.

TI  - Eliciting ethical and social values in health technology assessment: A 
      participatory approach.
PG  - 135-44
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.04.017 [doi]
AB  - Despite a growing consensus that ethical and social values should be addressed in 
      health technology assessment (HTA) processes, there exist a variety of methods 
      for doing so. There is growing interest in involving citizens in policy 
      development to ensure that decisions are legitimate, and reflect the broad social 
      values of the public. We sought to bring these issues together by employing a 
      participatory approach to elicit ethical and social values in HTA. Our primary 
      objective was to elicit a set of ethical and social values from citizens that 
      could be used to guide Ontario's HTA evidentiary review and appraisal process. A 
      secondary objective was to explore the feasibility of using participatory 
      approaches to elicit these values. A 14-person Citizens' Reference Panel on 
      Health Technologies was established to provide input to the Ontario Health 
      Technology Advisory Committee in developing its recommendations. A mixed methods 
      approach was used where informed, deliberative discussions were combined with 
      pre- and post-questionnaires, which assessed the relative importance of various 
      ethical and social values as well as their stability over time. Over the course 
      of five meetings, panel members progressed toward the identification of a set of 
      core values -universal access, choice and quality care. These values were 
      consistently prioritized as the core values that should be considered in the 
      evaluation of health technologies and ensuing recommendations. Sustained and 
      deliberative methods, like a citizens' panel, offer a promising approach for 
      eliciting ethical and social values into HTA.

TI  - Cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in locally advanced 
      pancreatic cancer.
PG  - 1119-29
LID - 10.1002/cncr.26365 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy may improve the outcome of patients with pancreatic 
      cancer but at an increased cost. In this study, the authors evaluated the 
      cost-effectiveness of modern radiotherapy techniques in the treatment of locally 
      advanced pancreatic cancer. METHODS: A Markov decision-analytic model was 
      constructed to compare the cost-effectiveness of 4 treatment regimens: 
      gemcitabine alone, gemcitabine plus conventional radiotherapy, gemcitabine plus 
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT); and gemcitabine with stereotactic body 
      radiotherapy (SBRT). Patients transitioned between the following 5 health states: 
      stable disease, local progression, distant failure, local and distant failure, 
      and death. Health utility tolls were assessed for radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
      treatments and for radiation toxicity. RESULTS: SBRT increased life expectancy by 
      0.20 quality-adjusted life years (QALY) at an increased cost of $13,700 compared 
      with gemcitabine alone (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] = $69,500 per 
      QALY). SBRT was more effective and less costly than conventional radiotherapy and 
      IMRT. An analysis that excluded SBRT demonstrated that conventional radiotherapy 
      had an ICER of $126,800 per QALY compared with gemcitabine alone, and IMRT had an 
      ICER of $1,584,100 per QALY compared with conventional radiotherapy. A 
      probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of 
      cost-effectiveness at a willingness to pay of $50,000 per QALY was 78% for 
      gemcitabine alone, 21% for SBRT, 1.4% for conventional radiotherapy, and 0.01% 
      for IMRT. At a willingness to pay of $200,000 per QALY, the probability of 
      cost-effectiveness was 73% for SBRT, 20% for conventional radiotherapy, 7% for 
      gemcitabine alone, and 0.7% for IMRT. CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated 
      that IMRT in locally advanced pancreatic cancer exceeds what society considers 
      cost-effective. In contrast, combining gemcitabine with SBRT increased clinical 
      effectiveness beyond that of gemcitabine alone at a cost potentially acceptable 
      by today's standards.

PG  - 243-51
LID - 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.05.044 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To report outcomes in patients treated with intensity-modulated 
      radiotherapy (IMRT) for tumors of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity 
      (PNS/NC). METHODS/MATERIALS: Between June 2000 and December 2009, 52 patients 
      with tumors of the PNS/NC underwent postoperative or definitive radiation with 
      IMRT. Twenty-eight (54%) patients had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Twenty-nine 
      patients (56%) received chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 26.6 months 
      (range, 2.9-118.4) for all patients and 30.9 months for living patients. RESULTS: 
      Eighteen patients (35%) developed local-regional failure (LRF) at median time of 
      7.2 months. Thirteen local failures (25%) were observed, 12 in-field and 1 
      marginal. Six regional failures were observed, two in-field and four 
      out-of-field. No patients treated with elective nodal radiation had nodal 
      regional failure. Two-year local-regional control (LRC), in-field LRC, freedom 
      from distant metastasis (FFDM), and overall survival (OS) were 64%, 74%, 71%, and 
      66% among all patients, respectively, and 43%, 61%, 61%, and 53% among patients 
      with SCC, respectively. On multivariate analysis, SCC and >1 subsite involved had 
      worse LRC (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.046, respectively) and OS (p = 0.003 and p = 
      0.046, respectively). Cribriform plate invasion (p = 0.005) and residual disease 
      (p = 0.047) also had worse LRC. Acute toxicities included Grade >/=3 mucositis in 
      19 patients (37%), and Grade 3 dermatitis in 8 patients (15%). Six patients had 
      Grade >/=3 late toxicity including one optic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: IMRT for 
      patients with PNS/NC tumors has good outcomes compared with historical series and 
      is well tolerated. Patients with SCC have worse LRC and OS. LRF is the 
      predominant pattern of failure.

TI  - The unbearable lightness of citizens within public deliberation processes.
PG  - 1843-50
LID - 10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.02.023 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing literature examining the involvement of citizens in health 
      policymaking. While determining what form such involvement should take and who 
      should participate is of particular interest to policymakers and researchers, the 
      current ontological understanding of what a citizen is suffers from "lightness." 
      This essay thus seeks to provide more depth by shedding light on the ways in 
      which individuals define what "being" a citizen means for them and choose to 
      embody or not such a role. Inspired by a four-year ethnographic study of a 
      Canadian science/policy network in genetics, which integrated citizens into its 
      operation, this paper provides four biographical sketches that portray the 
      complexity and richness of what these individuals were "made of." We reflect on 
      how they sought to make sense of their participation in the network by drawing on 
      a repertoire of cultural, relational and cognitive resources and on their lived 
      experience. Their capacity to "be" a participant and to be acknowledged as such 
      by the others was shaped by their values and interests and by the contributions 
      they sought to realise throughout their participation. Our discussion suggests 
      that the quest for the "ordinary" citizen is misleading. Instead, acknowledging 
      the sociological concreteness of citizenship and understanding how it may be 
      embodied and exercised should be a key focus in public involvement theory and 
      practice in health care.

TI  - Analyzing the influence of institutions on health policy development in Uganda: a 
      case study of the decision to abolish user fees.
PG  - 578-86
AB  - BACKGROUND: During the 2001 election campaign, President Yoweri Museveni 
      announced he was abolishing user fees for health services in Uganda. No analysis 
      has been carried out to explain how he was able to initiate such an important 
      policy decision without encountering any immediate barriers. OBJECTIVE: To 
      explain this outcome through in-depth policy analysis driven by the application 
      of key analytical frameworks. METHODS: An explanatory case study informed by 
      analytical frameworks from the institutionalism literature was undertaken. 
      Multiple data sources were used including: academic literature, key government 
      documents, grey literature, and a variety of print media. RESULTS: According to 
      the analytical frameworks employed, several formal institutional constraints 
      existed that would have reduced the prospects for the abolition of user fees. 
      However, prevalent informal institutions such as "Big Man" presidentialism and 
      clientelism that were both 'competing' and 'complementary' can be used to explain 
      the policy outcome. The analysis suggests that these factors trumped the impact 
      of more formal institutional structures in the Ugandan context. CONCLUSION: 
      Consideration should be given to the interactions between formal and informal 
      institutions in the analysis of health policy processes in Uganda, as they 
      provide a more nuanced understanding of how each set of factors influence policy 
      outcomes.

TI  - Symptom Dimensions in Two Samples of Africans Americans with Obsessive-Compulsive 
      Disorder.
PG  - 145-152
AB  - Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide, 
      however, there is a lack of research that includes African Americans, thus it is 
      unclear whether findings about symptom dimensions can be generalized to this 
      population. A sample of adult African Americans with OCD (N=74) was recruited at 
      the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) and administered the Yale Brown 
      Obsessive-Compulsive checklist (YBOCS) to better understand the phenomenology of 
      OCD in African Americans. Frequencies of symptoms are reported and compared to 
      findings from the National Survey of American Life (NSAL; N=54). A principal 
      components analysis of YBOCS categories and items was performed on the Penn 
      sample. A six-component solution was found, that included Contamination & 
      Washing, Hoarding, Sexual Obsessions & Reassurance, Aggression & Mental 
      Compulsions, Symmetry & Perfectionism, and Doubt & Checking, explaining 59.1% of 
      the variance. Factors identified were similar to those of previous studies in 
      primarily white samples. African Americans with OCD reported more contamination 
      symptoms and were twice as likely to report excessive concerns with animals as 
      European Americans with OCD. The results indicate the presence of cultural 
      differences, which is consistent with findings among non-clinical samples. 
      Implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Models that describe the key features and intended effects of specific knowledge 
      translation and exchange (KTE) interventions are much less prominent than models 
      that provide a more general understanding of KTE. Our aim was to develop a model 
      in order to describe the key features and intended effects of deliberative 
      dialogues used as a KTE strategy and to understand how deliberative dialogues can 
      support evidence-informed policymaking. By using critical interpretive synthesis, 
      we identified 17 papers representing four fields of enquiry and integrated our 
      findings into a model. The key features described in the model are: 1) an 
      appropriate (i.e., conducive to the particular dialogue) meeting environment; 2) 
      an appropriate mix of participants; and, 3) an appropriate use of research 
      evidence. These features combine to create three types of intended effects: 1) 
      short-term individual-level; 3) medium-term community/organizational-level; and, 
      3) long-term system-level. The concept of capacity building helps to explain the 
      relationship between features and effects. The model is a useful contribution to 
      the KTE field because it is a practical tool that could be used to guide the 
      development and evaluation of deliberative dialogues in order to understand more 
      about achieving particular outcomes in relation to specific issues or contexts.

TI  - The effect of dead-on-arrival and emergency department death classification on 
      risk-adjusted performance in the American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality 
      Improvement Program.
PG  - 1086-91; discussion 1091-2
LID - 10.1097/TA.0b013e31826fc7a0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons' Trauma Quality Improvement Program 
      is focused on identifying variations in outcomes across trauma centers for the 
      purposes of performance improvement. In previous analyses, patients who died in 
      the emergency department were excluded. We investigated the effect of inclusion 
      and exclusion of emergency department (ED) deaths (dead on arrival [DOA] and died 
      in ED [DIE]) on analyses of overall risk-adjusted trauma center performance. 
      METHODS: Data for patients admitted to 65 Trauma Quality Improvement Program 
      hospitals during the 2009 calendar year was used. A logistic regression model was 
      developed to estimate risk-adjusted mortality. Trauma centers were then ranked 
      based on their observed-to-expected (O/E) mortality ratio with 90% confidence 
      intervals (CIs) and classified by outlier status: low outliers/high performers 
      had a 90% CI for O/E mortality ratio of less than 1, and high outliers/low 
      performers had a 90% CI for O/E mortality ratio of greater than 1. Changes in 
      outlier status, rank, and quartile were examined with and without DOA and DIE 
      patients included in the analyses to discern the impact of such exclusions on 
      overall risk-adjusted center-specific performance. RESULTS: Thirty-one trauma 
      centers (48%) reported no DOA patients in 2009, while 6 centers (9%) reported 
      more than 10. Of 224 patients, 14 (6.2%) had a documented time of death of more 
      than 30 minutes after ED arrival despite being recorded as DOA. Forty-one trauma 
      centers (63%) changed rank by three positions or less. Ten trauma centers changed 
      their quartile ranking by a single quartile, but no centers were found to change 
      quartile rank more than one quartile. Changes in outlier status occurred for 6 
      trauma centers (9%). CONCLUSION: The relative frequency of patients classified as 
      DOA varies greatly between trauma centers. Misclassification of patients as DOA 
      occurs. Inclusion of ED deaths in risk-adjusted analysis of mortality results in 
      a small but insignificant change in predicting the outcome results of a trauma 
      center. This change is less than the rate of finding a center to be a high or low 
      outlier by chance alone using the 90% CI. Inclusion of DOA and DIE patients in 
      risk-adjusted analysis of mortality is appropriate and eliminates the bias 
      introduced by exclusion of ED deaths owing to misuse of the DOA classification. 
      LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic/epidemiologic study, level III.

TI  - Citizens' perspectives on personalized medicine: a qualitative public 
      deliberation study.
PG  - 1197-201
LID - 10.1038/ejhg.2012.300 [doi]
AB  - Our objective was to explore citizens' informed and reasoned values and 
      expectations of personalized medicine, a timely yet novel genomics policy issue. 
      A qualitative, public deliberation study was undertaken using a citizens' 
      reference panel on health technologies, established to provide input to the 
      health technology assessment process in Ontario, Canada. The citizens' panel 
      consisted of five women and nine men, aged 18-71 years, with one member selected 
      from each health authority region. There were shared expectations among the 
      citizens' panel members for the potential of personalized medicine technologies 
      to improve care, provided they are deemed clinically valid and effective. These 
      expectations were tempered by concerns about value for money and the possibility 
      that access to treatment may be limited by personalized medicine tests used to 
      stratify patients. Although they questioned the presumed technological imperative 
      presented by personalized medicine technologies, they called for increased 
      efforts to prepare the health-care system to effectively integrate these 
      technologies. This study represents an early but important effort to explore 
      public values toward personalized medicine. This study also provides evidence of 
      the public's ability to form coherent judgments about a new policy issue. 
      Concerned that personalized tests might be used to ration care, they suggested 
      that treatment should be made available if patients wanted it, irrespective of 
      tests that indicate little benefit. This issue raises clinical and policy 
      challenges that may undermine the value of personalized medicine. Further efforts 
      to deliberate with the public are warranted to inform effective, efficient and 
      equitable translation of personalized medicine.

TI  - Enhancing citizen engagement in cancer screening through deliberative democracy.
PG  - 380-6
LID - 10.1093/jnci/djs649 [doi]
AB  - Cancer screening is widely practiced and participation is promoted by various 
      social, technical, and commercial drivers, but there are growing concerns about 
      the emerging harms, risks, and costs of cancer screening. Deliberative democracy 
      methods engage citizens in dialogue on substantial and complex problems: 
      especially when evidence and values are important and people need time to 
      understand and consider the relevant issues. Information derived from such 
      deliberations can provide important guidance to cancer screening policies: 
      citizens' values are made explicit, revealing what really matters to people and 
      why. Policy makers can see what informed, rather than uninformed, citizens would 
      decide on the provision of services and information on cancer screening. Caveats 
      can be elicited to guide changes to existing policies and practices. Policies 
      that take account of citizens' opinions through a deliberative democracy process 
      can be considered more legitimate, justifiable, and feasible than those that 
      don't.

TI  - Assessing the impacts of citizen deliberations on the health technology process.
PG  - 282-9
LID - 10.1017/S0266462313000299 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impacts of a Citizens' Reference Panel on the 
      deliberations of a provincial health technology advisory committee and its 
      secretariat, which produce, recommendations for the use of health technologies in 
      Ontario, Canada. METHODS: A fourteen-member citizens' reference panel was 
      convened five times between February 2009 and May 2010 to participate in 
      informed, facilitated discussions to inform the assessment of individual 
      technologies and provincial health technology assessment processes more 
      generally. Qualitative data collection methods were used to document observed and 
      perceived impacts of the citizens' panel on the health technology assessment 
      (HTA) process. RESULTS: Panel impacts were observed for all technologies 
      reviewed, at two different stages in the HTA process, and represented macro- 
      (raising awareness) and micro-level (informing recommendations) impacts. These 
      impacts were shaped by periodic opportunities for direct and brokered exchange 
      between the Panel and the expert advisory committee to clarify roles, foster 
      accountability, and build trust. Our findings offer new insights about one of the 
      main considerations in the design of deliberative participatory structures-how to 
      maintain the independence of a citizens' panel while ensuring that their input is 
      considered at key junctures in the HTA process. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens' panels can 
      exert various impacts on the HTA process. Ensuring these types of structures 
      include opportunities for direct exchange between citizens and experts, to 
      clarify roles, promote accountability, and build trust will facilitate their 
      impacts in a variety of settings.

TI  - The visible politics of the privatization debate in Quebec.
PG  - 67-79
AB  - This paper analyzes the debates surrounding the privatization of health services 
      financing in Quebec. The objective is to clarify policy-making processes with 
      regard to this important issue and, more generally, to provide a realistic 
      understanding of health-related policy processes in Canada. The analysis is based 
      on a large and continuous sample of mass media and National Assembly debates on 
      the question during the four-and-a-half years following the Chaoulli ruling of 
      the Supreme Court of Canada. These data are used to test four hypotheses about 
      relationships among the types of political actors involved, their policy 
      preferences, the rhetoric they use and the anticipated policy effects they 
      assert. The results are applied to a discussion of questions about the factors 
      that influence the effectiveness of political communication.

TI  - How contexts and issues influence the use of policy-relevant research syntheses: 
      a critical interpretive synthesis.
PG  - 604-48
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12026 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Evidence briefs have emerged as a promising approach to synthesizing the 
      best available research evidence for health system policymakers and stakeholders. 
      An evidence brief may draw on systematic reviews and many other types of 
      policy-relevant information, including local data and studies, to describe a 
      problem, options for addressing it, and key implementation considerations. We 
      conducted a systematic review to examine the ways in which context- and 
      issue-related factors influence the perceived usefulness of evidence briefs among 
      their intended users. METHODS: We used a critical interpretive synthesis approach 
      to review both empirical and nonempirical literature and to develop a model that 
      explains how context and issues influence policymakers' and stakeholders' views 
      of the utility of evidence briefs prepared for priority policy issues. We used a 
      "compass" question to create a detailed search strategy and conducted electronic 
      searches in CINAHL, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, IPSA, MEDLINE, OAIster (gray literature), 
      ProQuest A&I Theses, ProQuest (Sociological Abstracts, Applied Social Sciences 
      Index and Abstracts, Worldwide Political Science Abstracts, International 
      Bibliography of Social Sciences, PAIS, Political Science), PsychInfo, Web of 
      Science, and WilsonWeb (Social Science Abstracts). Finally, we used a grounded 
      and interpretive analytic approach to synthesize the results. FINDINGS: Of the 
      4,461 papers retrieved, 3,908 were excluded and 553 were assessed for 
      "relevance," with 137 included in the initial sample of papers to be analyzed and 
      an additional 23 purposively sampled to fill conceptual gaps. Several themes 
      emerged: (1) many established types of "evidence" are viewed as useful content in 
      an evidence brief, along with several promising formatting features; (2) 
      contextual factors, particularly the institutions, interests, and values of a 
      given context, can influence views of evidence briefs; (3) whether an issue is 
      polarizing and whether it is salient (or not) and familiar (or not) to actors in 
      the policy arena can influence views of evidence briefs prepared for that issue; 
      (4) influential factors can emerge in several ways (as context driven, issue 
      driven, or a result of issue-context resonance); (5) these factors work through 
      two primary pathways, affecting either the users or the producers of briefs; and 
      (6) these factors influence views of evidence briefs through a variety of 
      mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS: Those persons funding and preparing evidence briefs need 
      to consider a variety of context- and issue-related factors when deciding how to 
      make them most useful in policymaking.

AB  - It is often useful to replace a small region of the yeast genome containing a 
      gene of interest with a selectable marker. The selectable marker allows for easy 
      identification of yeast cells that have successfully carried out the gene 
      replacement, and functional consequences of the loss of that gene can then be 
      assessed. The same technique can also be used for removing noncoding portions of 
      the genome that may be of interest, such as promoters or 3' or 5' UTRs, and for 
      introducing tags on the N- or C-termini of proteins (alternatively, see a 
      marker-free yeast gene replacement method on Gene Knockouts, in vivo 
      site-directed mutagenesis and Other Modifications Using the Delitto Perfetto 
      System in Saccharomyces cerevisiae).

TI  - Biased Brownian ratcheting leads to pre-mRNA remodeling and capture prior to 
      first-step splicing.
PG  - 1450-7

AB  - The spliceosome is a dynamic ribonucleoprotein (RNP) machine that catalyzes the 
      removal of introns during the two transesterification steps of eukaryotic 
      pre-mRNA splicing. Here we used single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer to monitor the distance of the 5' splice site (5' SS) and branch point 
      (BP) of pre-mRNA in affinity-purified spliceosomes stalled by a mutation in the 
      DExD/H-box helicase Prp2 immediately before the first splicing step. Addition of 
      recombinant Prp2 together with NTP and protein cofactor Spp2 rearranges the 
      spliceosome-substrate complex to reversibly explore conformations with proximal 
      5' SS and BP that accommodate chemistry. Addition of Cwc25, a small heat-stable 
      splicing factor, then strongly biases this equilibrium toward the proximal 
      conformation, promoting efficient first-step splicing. The spliceosome thus 
      functions as a biased Brownian ratchet machine where a helicase unlocks thermal 
      fluctuations subsequently rectified by a cofactor 'pawl', a principle possibly 
      widespread among the many helicase-driven RNPs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity has historically been a positive predictor of surgical 
      morbidity, especially in the morbidly obese. The purpose of our study was to 
      compare outcomes of obese patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC). 
      METHODS: We reviewed 1382 consecutive patients retrospectively who underwent LC 
      for various pathologies from January 2008 to August 2011. Patients were 
      stratified based on the World Health Organization definitions of obesity: 
      nonobese (body mass index [BMI] < 30 kg/m(2)), obesity class I (BMI 
      30-34.9 kg/m(2)), obesity class II (BMI 35-39.9 kg/m(2)), and obesity class III 
      (BMI >/= 40 kg/m(2)). The primary end points were conversion rates and surgical 
      morbidity. The secondary end point was length of stay. RESULTS: There were 
      significantly more females in the obesity II and III groups (P = 0.0002). 
      American Society of Anesthesiologists scores were significantly higher in the 
      obesity I, II, and III groups compared with the nonobese (P < 0.05; P < 0.01; and 
      P < 0.0001, respectively). Independent predictors of conversion on multivariate 
      analysis (MVA) included age (P = 0.01), acute cholecystitis (P = 0.03), operative 
      time (P < 0.0001), blood loss (P < 0.0001), and fellowship-trained surgeons 
      (P < 0.0001). Independent predictors of intraoperative complications on MVA 
      included age (P = 0.009), white patients (P = 0.009), previous surgery 
      (P = 0.001), operative time (P < 0.0001), and blood loss (P = 0.01). Independent 
      predictors of postoperative complications on MVA included American Society of 
      Anesthesiologists score (P < 0.0001), acute cholecystitis (P < 0.0001), and a 
      postoperative complication (P < 0.0001). BMI was not a predictor of conversions 
      or surgical morbidity. Length of stay was not significantly different between the 
      four groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that overall conversion rates 
      and surgical morbidity are relatively low following LC, even in obese and 
      morbidly obese patients.

TI  - Framing incremental expansions to public health insurance systems: the case of 
      Canadian pharmacare.
PG  - 295-330
LID - 10.1215/03616878-2416229 [doi]
AB  - Canada is the only country in the world to offer universal comprehensive public 
      health insurance that excludes outpatient prescription medicines. Few scholars 
      have attempted to explain this policy puzzle. We study media coverage of 
      prescription drug financing from 1990 to 2010 to elucidate how the policy problem 
      and potential solutions have been framed in media discourse and identify the 
      actors that have dominated media texts. We confirm previous analyses that have 
      revealed the significant role played by policy elites in media coverage of health 
      reform debates. We also find that proposed expansions to public coverage are 
      presented as a financial liability that could "crowd out" the existing (and 
      popular) public insurance program. Within the context of a predominantly public 
      funded system, framing of incremental expansion reorients away from values and 
      toward discourse related to costs--both of the current system and of potential 
      reforms. This may reflect a strategic narrative used by actors to maintain "silos 
      of values" for coverage for prescription medicines versus those for other 
      services. This has significant implications for the motivation for reform among 
      the electorate and politicians alike, and for the extent to which policy 
      developments, if they occurred, would legitimately reflect societal values for 
      health financing.

TI  - Esophageal reinforcement with an extracellular scaffold during total gastrectomy 
      for gastric cancer.
PG  - 1252-7
LID - 10.1245/s10434-014-4125-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Esophagojejunal (EJ) anastomotic leaks after total gastrectomy (TG) 
      for malignancy lead to significant morbidity and mortality, thus affecting 
      long-term survival. Preclinical and clinical trials have shown promise in 
      utilizing degradable extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffolds in buttressing 
      anastomoses. We describe our experience buttressing the EJ anastomosis after TG 
      with a ECM scaffold. METHODS: From February 2012 to January 2014, a total of 37 
      consecutive patients underwent TG buttressing of the EJ anastomosis with the 
      degradable ECM scaffold composed of a porcine urinary bladder called MatriStem 
      (ACell Inc.). The scaffold was circumferentially wrapped around the EJ 
      anastomosis. The primary end point was the EJ leak rate, while the secondary end 
      point was the EJ stricture rate. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD age and body mass index 
      were 59 +/- 16 years and 28.1 +/- 4.9 kg/m(2), respectively. Most patients were male 
      (51 %), white (78 %), and former smokers (51 %). Over half (59 %) underwent 
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A minimally invasive TG was performed in 70 % of 
      patients. Signet ring was the most common tumor type (48 %), and most patients 
      had midstage disease (59 %). The mean number of lymph nodes procured was 36 +/- 16. 
      Eighteen patients (49 %) experienced a complication, mostly minor. One patient 
      (2.7 %) developed an EJ leak, while three patients (8 %) developed an EJ 
      stricture. Median follow-up was 7 months (range 2-12 months). There was no 
      operative or in-hospital mortality. DISCUSSION: The use of urinary bladder matrix 
      scaffolds may be helpful in decreasing the incidence of EJ anastomotic leak 
      and/or stricture. A prospective phase II trial at our institution is currently 
      under way.

      randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 204-12
LID - 10.1002/da.22331 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding cognitive and biological mechanisms of PTSD treatment 
      can help refine treatments and increase rates of response. METHODS: Thirty-six 
      veterans with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive Prolonged exposure therapy 
      (PE) or Present-Centered therapy (PCT). We examined symptoms, trauma-related 
      cognitions, and two indices of HPA axis function (cortisol awakening response and 
      cortisol response to a script-driven imagery task). RESULTS: Thirty veterans 
      started treatment and 26 completed. PE resulted in significantly more symptom 
      reduction than PCT (P = .008). High treatment responders collapsed across 
      treatments showed nominally higher cortisol levels measured at pretreatment 30 
      min after trauma script exposure compared to low responders (P = .08). At 
      midtreatment, high treatment responders showed higher cortisol levels throughout 
      the imagery task (Ps = .03-.04). There were no differences between high and low 
      treatment responders at posttreatment. Thoughts of incompetence (F (1.6, 35.8) = 
      16.8, P = .000) and a dangerous world (F (1.3, 29.9) = 8.2, P = .004) 
      significantly improved over time in high treatment responders but showed no 
      change in low responders. Script-associated cortisol response prior to treatment 
      and reductions in thoughts of incompetence accounted for 83% of the variance in 
      reductions in PTSD severity with PE. CONCLUSIONS: Both increased cortisol 
      response to personal trauma script prior to PTSD therapy and reductions in 
      cognitive symptoms of PTSD were significantly and uniquely related to reductions 
      in the core symptoms of PTSD in PE. However, contrary to our hypotheses, cortisol 
      measures were not related to cognitive changes.

AB  - The concept of public involvement use is not well-defined in the literature. 
      Previous research studies have provided brief accounts of how public involvement 
      may influence health policy, but have not detailed the internal dynamics and 
      process through which it is actually used in the policy process. The study 
      objective is to examine and clarify the concept and process of public involvement 
      use in health policy decision-making. Using qualitative concept analysis methods, 
      we reviewed the literature on the use of public involvement and conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with key informants who have theoretical and/or 
      practical insights on public involvement and its use in policy decision-making. 
      Our findings are organized around interrelated questions that animate how the 
      concept of use is understood, interpreted, and operationalized. In asking, "How 
      is 'use' perceived in relation to health policy decision-making?" meanings are 
      constructed for the concept by identifying differences and drawing connections 
      between "use" and related terms. In asking "How would one know if public 
      involvement was used in health policy decision-making?" our findings weigh in on 
      the act of listening as a precursor to use, the ways in which use is mediated, 
      and responses to the input obtained from public involvement processes as signals 
      of use. These findings are a first step toward improving conceptual clarity about 
      what public involvement use means, how it is understood and interpreted by 
      relevant actors in the public involvement and public policy fields, and how it 
      might be operationalized. We expect our findings to be particularly useful for 
      public involvement practitioners who are often confronted with questions from 
      public involvement participants regarding how their input will be used in health 
      policy decision-making.

TI  - Supporting quality public and patient engagement in health system organizations: 
      development and usability testing of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation 
      Tool.
PG  - 817-27

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Only rudimentary tools exist to support health system organizations 
      to evaluate their public and patient engagement (PPE) activities. This study 
      responds to this gap by developing a generic evaluation tool for use in a wide 
      range of organizations. METHODS: The evaluation tool was developed through an 
      iterative, collaborative process informed by a review of published and grey 
      literature and with the input of Canadian PPE researchers and practitioners. Over 
      a 3-year period, structured e-mail, telephone and face-to-face exchanges, 
      including a modified Delphi process, were used to produce an evaluation tool that 
      includes core principles of high-quality engagement, expected outcomes for each 
      principle and three unique evaluation questionnaires that were tested and revised 
      with input from 65 end users. RESULTS: The tool is structured around four core 
      principles of 'quality engagement': (i) integrity of design and process; (ii) 
      influence and impact; (iii) participatory culture; and (iv) collaboration and 
      common purpose. Three unique questionnaires were developed to assess each of 
      these four evaluation domains from the following perspectives: (i) those who 
      participate in PPE activities; (ii) those who plan, execute or sponsor PPE 
      activities within organizations; and (iii) those who provide the leadership and 
      capacity for PPE within their organizations. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first known 
      collaboration of researchers and practitioners in the co-design of a 
      comprehensive PPE evaluation tool aimed at three distinct respondent groups and 
      for use in a wide range of health system organization settings.

      participation practice in Ontario CHCs.

AB  - The community participation literature has produced numerous frameworks to guide 
      practice and evaluation of community participation strategies in the health 
      sector. These frameworks are useful starting points for differentiating the 
      approaches for involving people in planning and decision-making for health 
      services, but have been critiqued for being too generic and ignoring that 
      community participation is highly contextual and situational. Health service 
      organizations across Canada and internationally have begun to respond to address 
      this limitation by developing more context-specific community participation 
      frameworks; however, such frameworks do not exist for Ontario Community Health 
      Centres (CHCs)-local primary health care organizations with a mandate to engage 
      marginalized groups in planning and decision-making for health services. We 
      conducted a series of focus groups with staff members from four Ontario CHCs to: 
      (1) examine the factors that would influence their use of a generic framework for 
      community participation with marginalized populations; and (2) improve the 
      "context-specificity" of this framework, to enhance its relevance to CHCs. 
      Participants described the difficulty of organizing the contextual, multi-faceted 
      and situational process of community participation that they experienced with 
      marginalized populations into a single framework, which led them to question the 
      value of using frameworks as a resource for guiding the design, implementation 
      and evaluation of their community participation initiatives. Instead, 
      participants revealed that tacit knowledge, in the form of professional and 
      personal experience and local knowledge of a marginalized population, had a 
      greater influence on guiding participation activities in Ontario CHCs. Our 
      findings suggest that tacit knowledge is an essential feature of community 
      participation practice and requires further exploration regarding its role in the 
      community participation field.

AB  - We report Single Molecule Cluster Analysis (SiMCAn), which utilizes hierarchical 
      clustering of hidden Markov modeling-fitted single-molecule fluorescence 
      resonance energy transfer (smFRET) trajectories to dissect the complex 
      conformational dynamics of biomolecular machines. We used this method to study 
      the conformational dynamics of a precursor mRNA during the splicing cycle as 
      carried out by the spliceosome. By clustering common dynamic behaviors derived 
      from selectively blocked splicing reactions, SiMCAn was able to identify the 
      signature conformations and dynamic behaviors of multiple ATP-dependent 
      intermediates. In addition, it identified an open conformation adopted late in 
      splicing by a 3' splice-site mutant, invoking a mechanism for substrate 
      proofreading. SiMCAn enables rapid interpretation of complex single-molecule 
      behaviors and should prove useful for the comprehensive analysis of a plethora of 
      dynamic cellular machines.

TI  - Enabling the participation of marginalized populations: case studies from a 
      health service organization in Ontario, Canada.
PG  - 636-649
LID - 10.1093/heapro/dav118 [doi]
AB  - We examined efforts to engage marginalized populations in Ontario Community 
      Health Centers (CHCs), which are primary health care organizations serving 74 
      high-risk communities. Qualitative case studies of community participation in 
      four Ontario CHCs were carried out through key informant interviews with CHC 
      staff to identify: (i) the approaches, strategies and methods used in 
      participation initiatives aimed specifically at engaging marginalized populations 
      in the planning of and decision making for health services; and (ii) the 
      challenges and enablers for engaging these populations. The marginalized 
      populations involved in the community participation initiatives studied included 
      Low-German Speaking Mennonites in a rural town, newcomer immigrants and refugees 
      in an urban downtown city, immigrant and francophone seniors in an inner city and 
      refugee women in an inner city. Our analysis revealed that enabling the 
      participation of marginalized populations requires CHCs to attend to the barriers 
      experienced by marginalized populations that constrain their participation. Key 
      informants outlined the features of a 'community development approach' that they 
      rely on to address the barriers to marginalized peoples' involvement by 
      strengthening their skills, abilities and leadership in capacity-building 
      activities. The community development approach also shaped the participation 
      methods that were used in the engagement process of CHCs. However, key informants 
      also described the challenges of applying this approach, influenced by the 
      cultural values of some groups, which shaped their willingness and motivation to 
      participate. This study provides further insight into the approach, strategies 
      and methods used in the engagement process to enable the participation of 
      marginalized populations, which may be transferable to other health services 
      settings.

TI  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease: A review of surgical decision making.
PG  - 77-83
LID - 10.4240/wjgs.v8.i1.77 [doi]
AB  - Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a very common disorder with increasing 
      prevalence. It is estimated that up to 20%-25% of Americans experience symptoms 
      of GERD weekly. Excessive reflux of acidic often with alkaline bile salt gastric 
      and duodenal contents results in a multitude of symptoms for the patient 
      including heartburn, regurgitation, cough, and dysphagia. There are also 
      associated complications of GERD including erosive esophagitis, Barrett's 
      esophagus, stricture and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. While first line 
      treatments for GERD involve mainly lifestyle and non-surgical therapies, surgical 
      interventions have proven to be effective in appropriate circumstances. 
      Anti-reflux operations are aimed at creating an effective barrier to reflux at 
      the gastroesophageal junction and thus attempt to improve physiologic and 
      mechanical issues that may be involved in the pathogenesis of GERD. The decision 
      for surgical intervention in the treatment of GERD, moreover, requires an 
      objective confirmation of the diagnosis. Confirmation is achieved using various 
      preoperative evaluations including: ambulatory pH monitoring, esophageal 
      manometry, upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy) and barium swallow. Upon 
      confirmation of the diagnosis and with appropriate patient criteria met, an 
      anti-reflux operation is a good alternative to prolonged medical therapy. 
      Currently, minimally invasive gastro-esophageal fundoplication is the gold 
      standard for surgical intervention of GERD. Our review outlines the many factors 
      that are involved in surgical decision-making. We will review the prominent 
      features that reflect appropriate anti-reflux surgery and present suggestions 
      that are pertinent to surgical practices, based on evidence-based studies.

TI  - Why do policies change? Institutions, interests, ideas and networks in three 
      cases of policy reform.
PG  - 1200-11
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czw052 [doi]
AB  - Policy researchers have used various categories of variables to explain why 
      policies change, including those related to institutions, interests and ideas. 
      Recent research has paid growing attention to the role of policy networks-the 
      actors involved in policy-making, their relationships with each other, and the 
      structure formed by those relationships-in policy reform across settings and 
      issues; however, this literature has largely ignored the theoretical integration 
      of networks with other policy theories, including the '3Is' of institutions, 
      interests and ideas. This article proposes a conceptual framework integrating 
      these variables and tests it on three cases of policy change in Burkina Faso, 
      addressing the need for theoretical integration with networks as well as the 
      broader aim of theory-driven health policy analysis research in low- and 
      middle-income countries. We use historical process tracing, a type of comparative 
      case study, to interpret and compare documents and in-depth interview data within 
      and between cases. We found that while network changes were indeed associated 
      with policy reform, this relationship was mediated by one or more of 
      institutions, interests and ideas. In a context of high donor dependency, new 
      donor rules affected the composition and structure of actors in the networks, 
      which enabled the entry and dissemination of new ideas and shifts in the overall 
      balance of interest power ultimately leading to policy change. The case of 
      strategic networking occurred in only one case, by civil society actors, 
      suggesting that network change is rarely the spark that initiates the process 
      towards policy change. This analysis highlights the important role of changes in 
      institutions and ideas to drive policymaking, but hints that network change is a 
      necessary intermediate step in these processes.

TI  - PUBLIC AND PATIENT INVOLVEMENT IN HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: A FRAMEWORK FOR 
      ACTION.
PG  - 256-264
AB  - OBJECTIVE: As health technology assessment (HTA) organizations in Canada and 
      around the world seek to involve the public and patients in their activities, 
      frameworks to guide decisions about whom to involve, through which mechanisms, 
      and at what stages of the HTA process have been lacking. The aim of this study 
      was to describe the development and outputs of a comprehensive framework for 
      involving the public and patients in a government agency's HTA process. METHODS: 
      The framework was informed by a synthesis of international practice and published 
      literature, a dialogue with local, national and international stakeholders, and 
      the deliberations of a government agency's public engagement subcommittee in 
      Ontario, Canada. RESULTS: The practice and literature synthesis failed to 
      identify a single, optimal approach to involving the public and patients in HTA. 
      Choice of methods should be considered in the context of each HTA stage, goals 
      for incorporating societal and/or patient perspectives into the process, and 
      relevant societal and/or patient values at stake. The resulting framework is 
      structured around four actionable elements: (i) guiding principles and goals for 
      public and patient involvement (PPI) in HTA, (ii) the establishment of a common 
      language to support PPI efforts, (iii) a flexible array of PPI approaches, and 
      (iv) on-going evaluation of PPI to inform adjustments over time. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      public and patient involvement framework has been developed for implementation in 
      a government agency's HTA process. Core elements of this framework may apply to 
      other organizations responsible for HTA and health system quality improvement.

TI  - Uncomfortable trade-offs: Canadian policy makers' perspectives on setting 
      objectives for their health systems.

LID - S0168-8510(16)30273-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.healthpol.2016.10.007 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a wide range of health system performance indicators are 
      commonly reported on, there has been little effort to establish their relevance 
      to the objectives that health systems actually pursue. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this 
      study was to identify, explore and better understand health policy makers' views 
      regarding the objectives and outcomes for their health systems, how they are 
      prioritized, and the underlying processes that yield them to inform the 
      development of health system efficiency measures. METHODS: A descriptive, 
      qualitative methodology was employed using key informant interviews with 17 
      current and former senior health ministry officials in 8 Canadian provinces and 2 
      territories. KEY FINDINGS: Health ministries have clearly stated objectives for 
      health systems focused on the achievement of health system delivery and 
      population health goals and, increasingly, public, patient and financial 
      accountability. Acute care objectives are routinely prioritized over population 
      health objectives and viewed as resulting from challenges associated with 
      difficult trade-off decisions shaped by organized interests and the media rather 
      than explicit, evidence-based processes. CONCLUSION: This study provides insights 
      beyond publicly available documents to explore the processes that underlie simple 
      statements of health system objectives. Our findings suggest that despite 
      respondents giving priority to improving individual and population health, it is 
      more commonly portrayed as an ideal objective than as a realistic one. By 
      understanding what lies behind statements about what health systems are striving 
      for, we offer a more robust avenue for increasing the uptake of future studies of 
      health system performance.

TI  - Primary Care Performance Measurement and Reporting at a Regional Level: Could a 
      Matrix Approach Provide Actionable Information for Policy Makers and Clinicians?
PG  - 33-51
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Primary care services form the foundation of modern healthcare 
      systems, yet the breadth and complexity of services and diversity of patient 
      populations may present challenges for creating comprehensive primary care 
      information systems. Our objective is to develop regional-level information on 
      the performance of primary care in Canada. METHODS: A scoping review was 
      conducted to identify existing initiatives in primary care performance 
      measurement and reporting across 11 countries. The results of this review were 
      used by our international team of primary care researchers and clinicians to 
      propose an approach for regional-level primary care reporting. RESULTS: We found 
      a gap between conceptual primary care performance measurement frameworks in the 
      peer-reviewed literature and real-world primary care performance measurement and 
      reporting activities. We did not find a conceptual framework or analytic approach 
      that could readily form the foundation of a regional-level primary care 
      information system. Therefore, we propose an approach to reporting comprehensive 
      and actionable performance information according to widely accepted core domains 
      of primary care as well as different patient population groups. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      approach that bridges the gap between conceptual frameworks and real-world 
      performance measurement and reporting initiatives could address some of the 
      potential pitfalls of existing ways of presenting performance information (i.e., 
      by single diseases or by age). This approach could produce meaningful and 
      actionable information on the quality of primary care services.

AB  - Major developments in cryo-electron microscopy in the past three or four years 
      have led to the solution of a number of spliceosome structures at high 
      resolution, e.g., the fully assembled but not yet active spliceosome (Bact), the 
      spliceosome just after the first step of splicing (C), and the spliceosome 
      activated for the second step (C*). Therefore 30 years of genetics and 
      biochemistry of the spliceosome can now be interpreted at the structural level. I 
      have closely examined the RNase H domain of Prp8 in each of the structures. 
      Interestingly, the RNase H domain has different and unexpected roles in each of 
      the catalytic steps of splicing.

TI  - Structural toggle in the RNaseH domain of Prp8 helps balance splicing fidelity 
      and catalytic efficiency.
PG  - 4739-4744
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1701462114 [doi]
AB  - Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step of eukaryotic gene expression that 
      requires both high efficiency and high fidelity. Prp8 has long been considered 
      the "master regulator" of the spliceosome, the molecular machine that executes 
      pre-mRNA splicing. Cross-linking and structural studies place the RNaseH domain 
      (RH) of Prp8 near the spliceosome's catalytic core and demonstrate that prp8 
      alleles that map to a 17-aa extension in RH stabilize it in one of two mutually 
      exclusive structures, the biological relevance of which are unknown. We performed 
      an extensive characterization of prp8 alleles that map to this extension and, 
      using in vitro and in vivo reporter assays, show they fall into two functional 
      classes associated with the two structures: those that promote 
      error-prone/efficient splicing and those that promote hyperaccurate/inefficient 
      splicing. Identification of global locations of endogenous splice-site activation 
      by lariat sequencing confirms the fidelity effects seen in our reporter assays. 
      Furthermore, we show that error-prone/efficient RH alleles suppress a prp2 mutant 
      deficient at promoting the first catalytic step of splicing, whereas 
      hyperaccurate/inefficient RH alleles exhibit synthetic sickness. Together our 
      data indicate that prp8 RH alleles link splicing fidelity with catalytic 
      efficiency by biasing the relative stabilities of distinct spliceosome 
      conformations. We hypothesize that the spliceosome "toggles" between such 
      error-prone/efficient and hyperaccurate/inefficient conformations during the 
      splicing cycle to regulate splicing fidelity.

TI  - Questioning patient engagement: research scientists' perceptions of the 
      challenges of patient engagement in a cardiovascular research network.
PG  - 1573-1583
LID - 10.2147/PPA.S135457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient engagement in research is a dominant discourse in clinical 
      research settings as it is seen as a move toward sustainable and equitable health 
      care systems. In Canada, a key driver is the Strategy for Patient-Oriented 
      Research of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, which asserts that 
      meaningful patient engagement can only be fostered when stakeholders understand 
      its value. This study assessed researchers' perceptions of the meaning and value 
      of patient engagement in research within a Canadian cardiovascular research 
      network. In doing so, the secondary aim was to inform the development of a 
      structured patient engagement initiative by identifying potential challenges and 
      related mitigation strategies. METHODS: We employed a multi-method strategy 
      involving electronic surveys and semi-structured telephone interviews with 
      network research scientists across Canada. Interview data were analyzed using 
      thematic and content analysis. Survey data were analyzed using descriptive 
      statistics. RESULTS: Thirty-eight electronic surveys (response rate =33%) and 16 
      interviews were completed with network members. Some participants were uncertain 
      about the meaning and value of patient engagement. While voicing guarded support, 
      four challenges relating to patient engagement were identified from the 
      interviews: 1) identification of representative and appropriate patients, 2) 
      uncertainty about the scope of patients' roles given concerns about knowledge 
      discrepancies, 3) a perceived lack of evidence of the impact of patient 
      engagement, and 4) the need for education and culture change as a prerequisite 
      for patient engagement. Research scientists were largely concerned that patients 
      untrained in science and tasked with conveying an authentic patient experience 
      and being a conduit for the voices of others might unsettle a traditional model 
      of conducting research. CONCLUSION: Concerns about patient involvement in 
      research were related to a lack of clarity about the meaning, process, and impact 
      of involvement. This study highlights the need for education on the meaning of 
      patient engagement, evidence of its impact, and guidance on practical aspects of 
      implementation within this research community.

TI  - Measuring Children's Mental Health in Ontario: Policy Issues and Prospects for 
      Change.
PG  - 88-98
AB  - Children's mental health in Canada is characterized by high needs coupled with 
      stark service shortfalls. In Ontario and in many provinces, addressing these 
      shortfalls is hampered by the absence of a measurement system, something that 
      researchers have long called for. This commentary aims to review the issues and 
      suggest prospects for improving the measurement of children's mental health in 
      Ontario and elsewhere. As background, we first describe the children's mental 
      health needs; outline the rationale for a measurement system; describe previous 
      attempts to introduce such systems, including in Ontario; and discuss the current 
      Ontario situation. We then explore some of the issues that constrain policy and 
      that need to be overcome, and suggest prospects for change - for advancing the 
      measurement of children's mental health in Ontario and Canada.

AB  - Evolving scientific evidence about mammography has raised new questions about the 
      net benefits of organized screening, yet gaps remain about women's current 
      screening practices, knowledge, attitudes and values toward screening to support 
      informed decision making in this area. We addressed this gap through an online 
      survey of 2000 screen-eligible women from Ontario, Canada in January 2016. 
      Likert-scaled and categorical questions were used to collect information about 
      screening practices, knowledge of benefits and risks of screening and underlying 
      attitudes and values toward screening. Results for all responses were summarized 
      using descriptive statistics. Comparison of results between ever screened versus 
      never screened respondents was performed using chi-squared tests. Most women felt 
      informed about screening yet had doubts about how informed their decisions were. 
      They were more confident in their knowledge of the benefits than the risks which 
      aligned with the emphasis given to benefits in discussions with health care 
      providers. The benefits of screening were linked with lowered anxiety about 
      breast cancer. The never screened were less likely to overstate the benefits of 
      screening, more likely to give weight to the risks, and less likely to report 
      anxiety or worry about breast cancer. Findings highlight the need for improved 
      communication strategies and decision supports that emphasize the provision of 
      current, balanced information about the benefits and risks of screening, both at 
      the population-level (through mass media) and within patient-provider 
      interactions. Sensitivity to the psychosocial factors that shape women's 
      attitudes toward mammography screening should be central to any strategy.

TI  - Patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making: A 
      systematic review of evaluation tools.
PG  - 1075-1084
LID - 10.1111/hex.12804 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement is growing, but evaluative efforts 
      remain limited. Reviews looking at evaluation tools for patient engagement in 
      individual decision making do exist, but no similar articles in research and 
      health systems have been published. OBJECTIVE: Systematically review and appraise 
      evaluation tools for patient and public engagement in research and health system 
      decision making. METHODS: We searched literature published between January 1980 
      and February 2016. Electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Database 
      of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and PsycINFO) were consulted, as well as grey 
      literature obtained through Google, subject-matter experts, social media and 
      engagement organization websites. Two independent reviewers appraised the 
      evaluation tools based on 4 assessment criteria: scientific rigour, patient and 
      public perspective, comprehensiveness and usability. RESULTS: In total, 10 663 
      unique references were identified, 27 were included. Most of these tools were 
      developed in the last decade and were designed to support improvement of 
      engagement activities. Only 11% of tools were explicitly based on a literature 
      review, and just 7% were tested for reliability. Patients and members of the 
      public were involved in designing 56% of the tools, mainly in the piloting stage, 
      and 18.5% of tools were designed to report evaluation results to patients and the 
      public. CONCLUSION: A growing number of evaluation tools are available to support 
      patient and public engagement in research and health system decision making. 
      However, the scientific rigour with which such evaluation tools are developed 
      could be improved, as well as the level of patient and public engagement in their 
      design and reporting.

AB  - Despite Canada's long history with mammography screening, little is known about 
      citizens' perspectives about mammography and how best to support women to make 
      informed choices about screening. To address this gap, a series of four citizen 
      deliberation events were held in 2015-16 in Ontario, a Canadian province with an 
      organized population-based breast screening program in place since 1990. 
      Forty-nine individuals participated in four citizen panels, each comprising an 
      information session highlighting the evidence about mammography, and large- and 
      small-group deliberations about approaches to support informed decision making 
      for screening. Following their engagement with the research evidence about 
      mammography, participants expressed concern about their lack of full awareness of 
      the risks and benefits and a strong desire for choice when it comes to screening. 
      To support informed choice, mammography programs need to reflect the values of 
      information sharing, trust and transparency, financial accountability, and allow 
      for personal interactions and shared decision-making. Citizens are looking for 
      balanced information about the risks and benefits of screening presented in an 
      easy to understand, comprehensive, and transparent manner. Primary health care 
      providers and organized screening programs are important sources of information 
      about mammography and must be vigilant in their efforts to support informed 
      decision-making in this area by ensuring that the information materials they are 
      using are balanced and reflect current evidence.

      Research.
PG  - 675-705
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12354 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points Engaging and involving underrepresented communities when setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. Groups and individuals 
      from minority and underserved communities strongly prioritized child health and 
      mental health research, often choosing to invest at the highest possible level. 
      Groups consisting of predominantly Native American or Arab American participants 
      invested in culture and beliefs research at the highest level, while many groups 
      did not select it at all. The priority given to culture and beliefs research by 
      these groups illustrates the importance of paying special attention to unique 
      preferences, and not just commonly held views, when getting public input on 
      spending priorities for research. CONTEXT: A major contributor to health 
      disparities is the relative lack of resources-including resources for 
      science-allocated to address the health problems of those with disproportionately 
      greater needs. Engaging and involving underrepresented communities in setting 
      research priorities could make the scientific research agenda more equitable, 
      more just, and more responsive to their needs and values. We engaged minority and 
      underserved communities in informed deliberations and report here their 
      priorities for health research. METHODS: Academic-community partnerships adapted 
      the simulation exercise CHAT for setting health research priorities. We had 
      participants from minority and medically underserved communities (47 groups, n = 
      519) throughout Michigan deliberate about health research priorities, and we used 
      surveys and CHAT software to collect the demographic characteristics and 
      priorities selected by individuals and groups. FINDINGS: The participants ranged 
      in age (18 to 88), included more women than men, and were overrepresented by 
      minority groups. Nearly all the deliberating groups selected child health and 
      mental health research (93.6% and 95.7%), and most invested at the highest level. 
      Aging, access, promote health, healthy environment, and what causes disease were 
      also prioritized by groups. Research on mental health and child health were high 
      priorities for individuals both before and after group deliberations. Access was 
      the only category more likely to be selected by individuals after group 
      deliberation (77.0 vs 84.0%, OR = 1.63, p = .005), while improve research, health 
      policy, and culture and beliefs were less likely to be selected after group 
      deliberations (all, p < .001). However, the level of investment in many 
      categories changed after the group deliberations. Participants identifying as 
      Black/African American were less likely to prioritize mental health research, and 
      those of Other race were more likely to prioritize culture and beliefs research. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Minority and medically underserved communities overwhelmingly 
      prioritized mental health and child health research in informed deliberations 
      about spending priorities.

AB  - As efforts to actively involve patients, family members and the broader public in 
      health service improvement and system redesign have grown, increasing attention 
      has also been paid to evaluation of their engagement in the health system. We 
      discuss key concepts and approaches related to evaluation, drawing particular 
      attention to different and potentially competing goals, stakeholders and 
      epistemological entry points. Evaluation itself can be supported by an increasing 
      number of frameworks and tools, matched to the relevant purpose and approach. The 
      patient engagement evaluation field faces several challenges, including the need 
      for greater specification of both the form and the context of engagement, the 
      need to balance the measurement imperative with the relational aspects of care 
      and the need for supportive organizations with the capacity and commitment to 
      undertake high-quality engagement and its evaluation.

TI  - Addressing the affordability of cancer drugs: using deliberative public 
      engagement to inform health policy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Health system expenditure on cancer drugs is rising rapidly in many 
      OECD countries given the costly new treatments and increased rates of use due to 
      a growing and ageing population. These factors put considerable strain on the 
      sustainability of health systems worldwide, sparking public debate among 
      clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, policy-makers and citizens on issues of 
      affordability and equity. We engaged Canadians through a series of deliberative 
      public engagement events to determine their priorities for making cancer drug 
      funding decisions fair and sustainable in Canada's publicly financed health 
      system. METHODS: An approach to deliberation was developed based on the McMaster 
      Health Forum's citizen panels and the established Burgess and O'Doherty model of 
      deliberative public engagement. Six deliberations were held across Canada in 
      2016. Transcripts were coded in NVivo and analysed to determine where 
      participants' views converged and diverged. Recommendations were grouped 
      thematically. RESULTS: A total of 115 Canadians participated in the deliberative 
      events and developed 86 recommendations. Recommendations included the review and 
      regular re-review of approved drugs using 'real-world' evidence on effectiveness 
      and cost-effectiveness; prioritisation of treatments that restore patients' 
      independence, mental health and general well-being; ensuring that decision 
      processes, results and their rationales are transparent; and commitment to people 
      with similar needs receiving the same care regardless of where in Canada they 
      live. CONCLUSIONS: The next steps for policy-makers should be to develop 
      mechanisms for (1) re-reviewing effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data for all 
      cancer drugs; (2) making disinvestments in cancer drugs that satisfy requirements 
      relating to grandfathering and compassionate access; (3) ensuring fair and 
      equitable access to cancer drugs for all Canadians; and (4) fostering a 
      pan-Canadian approach to cancer drug funding decisions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Open Minds, Healthy Minds, Ontario's Comprehensive Mental Health and 
      Addictions Strategy commits to the transformation of mental health and addictions 
      services for all Ontarians. OBJECTIVE: We analyzed the formulation and 
      implementation of this Strategy to address the question: What are the prospects 
      for transformative change in Ontario's current approach to mental health and 
      addictions? METHODS: Qualitative policy analysis using interpretive description 
      of key documents of the policy process, drawing on policy network and horizontal 
      governance theory. RESULTS: Three features set this policy process apart from 
      previous reform efforts: (1) expansion of the state pluralist network to those 
      outside of health, (2) extension of the policy network approach into the 
      Strategy's implementation stage and (3) the combined presence of political and 
      policy leadership. CONCLUSIONS: There is reason for optimism that the approach of 
      the Strategy has increased the prospects for the transformation of Ontario's 
      mental health and addictions system.

TI  - Citizen perspectives on the use of publicly reported primary care performance 
      information: Results from citizen-patient dialogues in three Canadian provinces.
PG  - 974-982
LID - 10.1111/hex.12902 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Performance measurement and reporting is proliferating in all sectors 
      of the healthcare system, including primary care, despite a dearth of evidence on 
      how the public uses reports on primary care performance. We explored how the 
      public might use this information, to guide the development of effective 
      reporting systems for primary care. METHODS: We conducted six full-day 
      deliberative dialogue sessions with a purposive sample of 56 citizen-patients 
      across three Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia). 
      Participants identified how they would use publicly reported performance data. We 
      conducted a thematic analysis of the data by region. RESULTS: Common uses for 
      primary care performance information emerged across all sessions. Participants 
      most often discussed the utility of this information for community advocacy and 
      participation in health system decision making. Similar barriers for using 
      performance information to choose a primary care provider were identified in each 
      region including the perceived lack of choice of providers and the high value 
      placed on relationships with current providers. Finally, the value of public 
      performance reporting in enhancing trust that people would receive good care was 
      also a common theme. CONCLUSIONS: Citizen-patient perspectives highlight that 
      public reporting on primary care performance could promote the health system's 
      responsiveness by enabling public engagement in decision making at the community 
      level. The role of public reporting in promoting trust rather than empowering 
      patient choice may reflect unique elements of the Canadian health system's 
      context.

TI  - Who is in and who is out? A qualitative analysis of stakeholder participation in 
      priority setting for health in three districts in Uganda.
PG  - 358-369
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czz049 [doi]
AB  - Stakeholder participation is relevant in strengthening priority setting processes 
      for health worldwide, since it allows for inclusion of alternative perspectives 
      and values that can enhance the fairness, legitimacy and acceptability of 
      decisions. Low-income countries operating within decentralized systems recognize 
      the role played by sub-national administrative levels (such as districts) in 
      healthcare priority setting. In Uganda, decentralization is a vehicle for 
      facilitating stakeholder participation. Our objective was to examine 
      district-level decision-makers' perspectives on the participation of different 
      stakeholders, including challenges related to their participation. We further 
      sought to understand the leverages that allow these stakeholders to influence 
      priority setting processes. We used an interpretive description methodology 
      involving qualitative interviews. A total of 27 district-level decision-makers 
      from three districts in Uganda were interviewed. Respondents identified the 
      following stakeholder groups: politicians, technical experts, donors, 
      non-governmental organizations (NGO)/civil society organizations (CSO), cultural 
      and traditional leaders, and the public. Politicians, technical experts and 
      donors are the principal contributors to district-level priority setting and the 
      public is largely excluded. The main leverages for politicians were control over 
      the district budget and support of their electorate. Expertise was a 
      cross-cutting leverage for technical experts, donors and NGO/CSOs, while 
      financial and technical resources were leverages for donors and NGO/CSOs. 
      Cultural and traditional leaders' leverages were cultural knowledge and influence 
      over their followers. The public's leverage was indirect and exerted through 
      electoral power. Respondents made no mention of participation for vulnerable 
      groups. The public, particularly vulnerable groups, are left out of the priority 
      setting process for health at the district. Conflicting priorities, interests and 
      values are the main challenges facing stakeholders engaged in district-level 
      priority setting. Our findings have important implications for understanding how 
      different stakeholder groups shape the prioritization process and whether 
      representation can be an effective mechanism for participation in health-system 
      priority setting.

AB  - Including information and values from patients in HTA has the potential to 
      improve both the process and outcomes of health technology policy decisions. 
      Accordingly, funding and structural incentives to include patients in HTA 
      activities have increased over the past several years. Unfortunately, these 
      incentives have not yet been accompanied by a corresponding increase in 
      resources, time, or commitment to responsiveness. In this Perspectives piece, we 
      reflect on our collective experiences participating in, conducting, and 
      overseeing patient engagement activities within HTA to highlight the ethical 
      challenges associated with this area of activity. While we remain committed to 
      the idea that patient engagement activities strengthen the findings, relevance, 
      and legitimacy of health technology policy, we are deeply concerned about the 
      potential for these activities to do ethical harm. We use this analysis to call 
      for action to introduce strong protections against ethical violations that may 
      harm patients participating in HTA engagement activities.

AB  - CONTEXT: Engaging underrepresented communities in health research priority 
      setting could make the scientific agenda more equitable and more responsive to 
      their needs. OBJECTIVE: Evaluate democratic deliberations engaging minority and 
      underserved communities in setting health research priorities. METHODS: 
      Participants from underrepresented communities throughout Michigan (47 groups, 
      n = 519) engaged in structured deliberations about health research priorities in 
      professionally facilitated groups. We evaluated some aspects of the structure, 
      process, and outcomes of deliberations, including representation, equality of 
      participation, participants' views of deliberations, and the impact of group 
      deliberations on individual participants' knowledge, attitudes, and points of 
      view. Follow-up interviews elicited richer descriptions of these and also 
      explored later effects on deliberators. RESULTS: Deliberators (age 18-88 years) 
      overrepresented minority groups. Participation in discussions was well 
      distributed. Deliberators improved their knowledge about disparities, but not 
      about health research. Participants, on average, supported using their group's 
      decision to inform decision makers and would trust a process like this to inform 
      funding decisions. Views of deliberations were the strongest predictor of these 
      outcomes. Follow-up interviews revealed deliberators were particularly struck by 
      their experience hearing and understanding other points of view, sometimes 
      surprised at the group's ability to reach agreement, and occasionally activated 
      to volunteer or advocate. CONCLUSIONS: Deliberations using a structured group 
      exercise to engage minority and underserved community members in setting health 
      research priorities met some important criteria for a fair, credible process that 
      could inform policy. Deliberations appeared to change some opinions, improved 
      some knowledge, and were judged by participants worth using to inform 
      policymakers.

      organizations: Results from an implementation research study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As citizens, patients and family members are participating in 
      numerous and expanding roles in health system organizations, attention has turned 
      to evaluating these efforts. The context-specific nature of engagement requires 
      evaluation tools to be carefully designed for optimal use. We sought to address 
      this need by assessing the appropriateness and feasibility of a generic tool 
      across a range of health system organizations, engagement activities and patient 
      groups. METHODS: We used a mixed-methods implementation research design to study 
      the implementation of an engagement evaluation tool in seven health system 
      organizations in Ontario, Canada focusing on two key implementation outcome 
      variables: appropriateness and feasibility. Data were collected through 
      respondent feedback questions (binary and open-ended) at the end of the tool's 
      three questionnaires as well as interviews and debriefing discussions with 
      engagement professionals and patient partners from collaborating organizations. 
      RESULTS: The three questionnaires comprising the evaluation tool were 
      collectively administered 29 times to 405 respondents yielding a 52% response 
      rate (90% and 53% of respondents respectively assessed the survey's 
      appropriateness and feasibility [quantitatively or qualitatively]). The 
      questionnaires' basic properties were rated highly by all respondents. Concrete 
      suggestions were provided for improving the appropriateness and feasibility of 
      the questionnaires (or components within) for different engagement activity and 
      organization types, and for enhancing the timing of implementation. DISCUSSION 
      AND CONCLUSIONS: Our study findings offer guidance for health system 
      organizations and evaluators to support the optimal use of engagement evaluation 
      tools across a variety of health system settings, engagement activities and 
      respondent groups.

      when there is no "right" answer: a qualitative citizen deliberation study.
PG  - E730-E737
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20190102 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Women are encouraged to make informed choices about mammography 
      screening that align with their values and preferences, yet information materials 
      developed by screening programs rarely provide complete, balanced information 
      about screening. Through a series of deliberations with Ontario citizens, we 
      elicited perspectives on materials developed by screening programs to support 
      informed decision-making. METHODS: We held 4 deliberative engagement events with 
      citizens to discuss the current evidence about mammography and informed 
      decision-making for the general population (i.e., women not at high risk) in the 
      context of organized screening programs. Participants reviewed and provided 
      feedback on the educational materials currently produced by screening programs in 
      8 provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, 
      Nova Scotia and Newfoundland and Labrador) and 2 territories (Yukon Territory and 
      Northwest Territory) and identified the key features that should guide the design 
      of these materials to optimally support informed decision-making. RESULTS: In 
      general, participants viewed the educational materials as insufficient to support 
      informed decision-making. They identified the following key features of optimal 
      educational materials: they should be accessible, complete and accurate, and 
      provide information on both benefits and risks of screening in a comprehensive, 
      easy-to-understand manner. Information materials should evoke the trust of the 
      reader, and they should be consistent across Canada. INTERPRETATION: Canadian 
      women have insufficient access to reliable information sources and complete 
      evidence about mammography screening, and, without this information, they are 
      unable to make fully informed decisions. Canadian breast screening programs must 
      take steps to improve the information shared with women to support informed 
      decision-making that aligns with women's values and preferences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a growing body of literature that describes, applies, and 
      evaluates applications of health-system priority-setting frameworks in different 
      contexts. However, little explicit focus has been given to examining 
      operationalization of the stakeholder participation component of these 
      frameworks. The literature identifies the public as a stakeholder group and 
      recommends their participation when applying the frameworks. METHODS: We 
      conducted a scoping review to search the PubMed, EMBASE, HealthSTAR, Medline, and 
      PsycINFO databases for cases where priority-setting frameworks were applied 
      (2000-2017). We aimed to synthesize current literature to examine the degree to 
      which the public and vulnerable populations have been engaged through 
      applications of these frameworks FINDINGS: The following stakeholders commonly 
      participated: managers, administrators/coordinators, clinicians/physicians, 
      non-physician health care providers, health economists, academics/researchers, 
      experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers. Few papers reported on public 
      participation, and even fewer identified vulnerable groups that participate. 
      Stakeholders were most commonly reported to participate in identifying areas for 
      prioritization. CONCLUSIONS: While the frameworks were developed with stakeholder 
      participation in mind, in practice not all stakeholders are participating in 
      priority-setting processes as envisioned by the frameworks. The public and 
      vulnerable groups do not consistently participate, challenging the utility of the 
      participation component of frameworks in guiding stakeholder participation in 
      health-system priority setting. Frameworks can be more explicit about which 
      stakeholders should participate and detailing how their participation should be 
      operationalized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 40-60% of patients with generalized anxiety disorder experience 
      long-lasting improvement with gold standard psychosocial interventions. 
      Identifying neurobehavioral factors that predict treatment success might provide 
      specific targets for more individualized interventions, fostering more optimal 
      outcomes and bringing us closer to the goal of "personalized medicine." Research 
      suggests that reward and threat processing (approach/avoidance behavior) and 
      cognitive control may be important for understanding anxiety and comorbid 
      depressive disorders and may have relevance to treatment outcomes. This study was 
      designed to determine whether approach-avoidance behaviors and associated neural 
      responses moderate treatment response to exposure-based versus behavioral 
      activation therapy for generalized anxiety disorder. METHODS/DESIGN: We are 
      conducting a randomized controlled trial involving two 10-week group-based 
      interventions: exposure-based therapy or behavioral activation therapy. These 
      interventions focus on specific and unique aspects of threat and reward 
      processing, respectively. Prior to and after treatment, participants are 
      interviewed and undergo behavioral, biomarker, and neuroimaging assessments, with 
      a focus on approach and avoidance processing and decision-making. Primary 
      analyses will use mixed models to examine whether hypothesized approach, 
      avoidance, and conflict arbitration behaviors and associated neural responses at 
      baseline moderate symptom change with treatment, as assessed using the 
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 item scale. Exploratory analyses will examine 
      additional potential treatment moderators and use data reduction and machine 
      learning methods. DISCUSSION: This protocol provides a framework for how studies 
      may be designed to move the field toward neuroscience-informed and personalized 
      psychosocial treatments. The results of this trial will have implications for 
      approach-avoidance processing in generalized anxiety disorder, relationships 
      between levels of analysis (i.e., behavioral, neural), and predictors of 
      behavioral therapy outcome. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was retrospectively 
      registered within 21 days of first participant enrollment in accordance with 
      FDAAA 801 with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02807480. Registered on June 21, 2016, 
      before results.

AB  - The development of refugee health policies is significant, given the increased 
      volume of displaced persons seeking refuge in Canada and around the world. 
      Changes to the Canadian refugee health policy, known as the Interim Federal 
      Health Program (IFHP), limited healthcare access for refugees and refugee 
      claimants from 2012 to 2016. In this article, we present a policy analysis using 
      the case of the IFHP retrenchments to examine how political actors on opposing 
      sides of the issue defined the problem using different causal story mechanisms. 
      This analysis reveals that organized interests dramatically changed the problem 
      definition of the IFHP reforms. Following their use of causal stories in 
      redefining the problem, the courts declared that the reforms to refugee 
      healthcare were a form of cruel and unusual treatment. Understanding policy 
      strategies used by proponents of refugee healthcare coverage expansion is 
      important for countries responding to the current, enduring refugee crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in developed 
      public health systems remain understudied. Current approaches to HTA present a 
      variety of conceptual, methodological and practical problems in the context of 
      child health. This study explores the technical and sociopolitical determinants 
      of public funding decisions on paediatric drugs, through the analysis of 
      interviews with stakeholders involved in or impacted by HTA for child health 
      technologies at the provincial and national levels in Canada. METHODS: We 
      undertook in-depth interviews with a purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders 
      involved with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the 
      provincial (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Grounded theory methods were 
      employed to guide data collection and analysis. Theory on 'technology-as-policy' 
      and the sociopolitics of health technologies served as sensitizing concepts for 
      inductive data coding and analysis. Emergent themes informed the development of 
      conceptual and practical insights on social values and system dynamics related to 
      child HTA, of relevance to public policymaking on the coverage of health 
      technologies for children in Canada. RESULTS: Participant reflection on the 
      normative and systems dimensions of drug funding for children formed two broad 
      categories: HTA paradigms and sociopolitical context. Our analysis revealed 
      notable differences of context and substance related to child health technology 
      production, evaluation and use. These differences spanned the major phases of HTA 
      (from assembly to assessment to integration) and the surrounding sociopolitical 
      milieu (from markets to governance to politics). Careful analysis of these 
      differences sets in relief a number of substantive and procedural shortcomings of 
      current HTA paradigms in respect of child health. Our findings suggest a need to 
      rethink how HTA is structured and operationalized for child health technologies. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Current approaches to health technology assessment are not well 
      calibrated to the realities of child health and illness. Our study presents a 
      nuanced and contextually grounded analysis of concepts instrumental to drug 
      funding decisions for children. The insights generated are directly applicable to 
      the Canadian and Ontario contexts, but also yield fundamental knowledge about HTA 
      for children that are germane to drug policy in other health systems.

      multiple-case study of physician assistants in Ontario, Canada.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To meet the complex needs of healthcare delivery, the Ministry of 
      Health and Long Term Care (MOHLTC) introduced Physician Assistants (PAs) into the 
      Ontario health care system in 2006 with the goal of helping to increase access to 
      care, decrease wait times, improve continuity of care and provide a flexible 
      addition to the healthcare workforce. The characterization of healthcare 
      organizations as complex adaptive systems (CAS) may offer insight into the 
      relationships and interactions that optimize and restrict successful PA 
      integration. The aim of this study is to explore the integration of PAs across 
      multiple case settings and to understand the role of PAs within complex adaptive 
      systems. METHODS: An exploratory, multiple-case study was used to examine PA role 
      integration in four settings: family medicine, emergency medicine, general 
      surgery, and inpatient medicine. Interviews were conducted with 46 healthcare 
      providers and administrators across 13 hospitals and 6 family medicine clinics in 
      Ontario, Canada. Analysis was conducted in three phases including an inductive 
      thematic analysis within each of the four cases, a cross-case thematic analysis, 
      and a broader, deductive exploration of cross-case patterns pertaining to 
      specific complexity theory principles of interest. RESULTS: Forty-six health care 
      providers were interviewed across 19 different healthcare sites. Support for PA 
      contributions across various health care settings, the importance of role 
      awareness, supervisory relationship attributes, and role vulnerability are 
      interconnected and dynamic. Findings represent the experiences of PAs and other 
      healthcare providers, and demonstrate how the PAs willingness to work and ability 
      to build relationships allows for the establishment of interprofessional, 
      collaborative, and person-centered care. As a self-organizing agent in complex 
      adaptive systems (i.e., health organizations), PA role exploration revealed 
      patterns of team behavior, non-linear interconnections, open relationships, 
      dynamic systems, and the legacy of role implementation as defined by complexity 
      theory. CONCLUSIONS: By exploring the role of PAs across multiple sites, the 
      complexity theory lens concurrently fosters an awareness of emerging patterns, 
      relationships and non-linear interactions within the defined context of the 
      Ontario healthcare system. By establishing collaborative, interprofessional care 
      models in hospital and community settings, PAs are making a significant 
      contribution to Ontario healthcare settings.

TI  - Does moral reasoning influence public values for health care priority setting?: A 
      population-based randomized stated preference survey.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preferences of members of the public are recognized as important 
      inputs into health care priority-setting, though knowledge of such preferences is 
      scant. We sought to generate evidence of public preferences related to healthcare 
      resource allocation among adults and children. METHODS: We conducted an 
      experimental stated preference survey in a national sample of Canadian adults. 
      Preferences were elicited across a range of scenarios and scored on a visual 
      analogue scale. Intervention group participants were randomized to a moral 
      reasoning exercise prior to each choice task. The main outcomes were the 
      differences in mean preference scores by group, scenario, and demographics. 
      RESULTS: Our results demonstrate a consistent preference by participants to 
      allocate scarce health system resources to children. Exposure to the moral 
      reasoning exercise weakened but did not eliminate this preference. Younger 
      respondent age and parenthood were associated with greater preference for 
      children. The top principles guiding participants' allocative decisions were 
      treat equally, relieve suffering, and rescue those at risk of dying. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study affirms the relevance of age in public preferences for the allocation 
      of scarce health care resources, demonstrating a significant preference by 
      participants to allocate healthcare resources to children. However, this 
      preference diminishes when challenged by exposure to a range of moral principles, 
      revealing a strong public endorsement of equality of access. Definitions of value 
      in healthcare based on clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness may exclude moral 
      considerations that the public values, such as equality and humanitarianism, 
      highlighting opportunities to enrich healthcare priority-setting through public 
      engagement.

TI  - Understanding the Role of Values in Health Policy Decision-Making From the 
      Perspective of Policy-Makers and Stakeholders: A Multiple-Case Embedded Study in 
      Chile and Colombia.
PG  - 185-197
LID - 10.15171/ijhpm.2019.94 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chile and Colombia are examples of Latin American countries with 
      health systems shaped by similar values. Recently, both countries have crafted 
      policies to regulate the participation of private for-profit insurance companies 
      in their health systems, but through very different mechanisms. This study asks: 
      what values are important in the decision-making processes that crafted these 
      policies? And how and why are they used? METHODS: An embedded multiple-case study 
      design was carried out for 2 specific decisions in each country: (1) in Chile, 
      the development of the Universal Plan of Explicit Entitlements -AUGE/GES - and 
      mandating universal coverage of treatments for high-cost diseases; and (2) in 
      Colombia, the declaration of health as a fundamental right and a mechanism to 
      explicitly exclude technologies that cannot be publicly funded. We interviewed 
      key informants involved in one or more of the decisions and/or in the policy 
      analysis and development process that contributed to the eventual decision. The 
      data analysis involved a constant comparative approach and thematic analysis for 
      each case study. RESULTS: From the 40 individuals who were invited, 28 key 
      informants participated. A tension between 2 important values was identified for 
      each decision (eg, solidarity vs. individualism for the AUGE/GES plan in Chile; 
      human dignity vs. sustainability for the declaration of the right to health in 
      Colombia). Policy-makers used values in the decisionmaking process to frame 
      problems in meaningful ways, to guide policy development, as a pragmatic 
      instrument to make decisions, and as a way to legitimize decisions. In Chile, 
      values such as individualism and free choice were incorporated in decision-making 
      because attaining private health insurance was seen as an indicator of improved 
      personal economic status. In Colombia, human dignity was incorporated as the core 
      value because the Constitutional Court asserted its importance in its use of 
      judicial activism as a check on the power of the executive and legislative 
      branches. CONCLUSION: There is an opportunity to open further exploration of the 
      role of values in different health decisions, political sectors besides health, 
      and even other jurisdictions.

TI  - Priority measures for publicly reporting primary care performance: Results of 
      public engagement through deliberative dialogues in 3 Canadian provinces.
PG  - 1213-1223
LID - 10.1111/hex.13100 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: While public reporting of hospital-based performance measurement is 
      commonplace, it has lagged in the primary care sector, especially in Canada. 
      Despite the increasing recognition of patients as active partners in the 
      health-care system, little is known about what information about primary care 
      performance is relevant to the Canadian public. We explored patient perspectives 
      and priorities for the public reporting of primary care performance measures. 
      METHODS: We conducted six deliberative dialogue sessions across three Canadian 
      provinces (British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia). Participants were asked to 
      rank and discuss the importance of collecting and reporting on specific 
      dimensions and indicators of primary care performance. We conducted a thematic 
      analysis of the data. RESULTS: Fifty-six patients participated in the dialogue 
      sessions. Measures of access to primary care providers, communication with 
      providers and continuity of information across all providers involved in a 
      patient's care were identified as the highest priority indicators of primary care 
      performance from a patient perspective. Several common measures of quality of 
      care, such as rates of cancer screening, were viewed as too patient dependent to 
      be used to evaluate the health system or primary care provider's performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that public reporting aimed at patient 
      audiences should focus on a nuanced measure of access, incorporation of context 
      reported alongside measurement that is for public audiences, clear reporting on 
      provider communication and a measure of information continuity. Participants 
      highlighted the importance the public places on their providers staying up to 
      date with advances in care.

TI  - Ethical and Social Values for Paediatric Health Technology Assessment and Drug 
      Policy.
PG  - 374-382
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.144 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Public policy approaches to funding paediatric medicines in advanced 
      health systems remain understudied. In particular, the ethical and social values 
      dimensions of health technology assessment (HTA) and drug coverage decisions for 
      children have received almost no attention in research or policy. METHODS: To 
      elicit and understand the social values that influence decision-making for public 
      funding of paediatric drugs, we undertook a series of in-depth, semi-structured 
      interviews with a stratified purposive sample (n = 22) of stakeholders involved 
      with or affected by drug funding decisions for children at the provincial 
      (Ontario) and national levels in Canada. Constructivist grounded theory 
      methodology guided data collection and thematic analysis. RESULTS: Our study 
      provides empirical evidence about the unique ethical and social values dimensions 
      of HTA for children, and describes a novel social values typology for paediatric 
      drug policy decision-making. Three principal categories of values emerged from 
      stakeholder reflections on HTA and drug policy-making for children: procedural 
      values, structural values, and sociocultural values. Key findings include the 
      importance of attention to the procedural legitimacy of HTA for children, with 
      emphasis on the inclusion of child health voices in processes of technology 
      appraisal and policy uptake; a role for HTA institutions to consider the equity 
      impacts of technologies, both in setting review priorities and in assessing the 
      value of technologies for public coverage; and the potential benefits of a 
      distinct national framework to guide drug policy for children. CONCLUSION: 
      Current approaches to HTA are not well designed for the realities of child health 
      and illness, nor the societal priorities regarding children that our study 
      identified. This research generates new knowledge to inform decision-making on 
      paediatric drugs by HTA institutions and government payers in Canada and other 
      publicly-funded health systems, through insights into the relevant social values 
      for child drug funding decisions from varied stakeholder groups.

TI  - A framework for explaining the role of values in health policy decision-making in 
      Latin America: a critical interpretive synthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although values underpin the goals pursued in health systems, 
      including how health systems benefit the population, it is often not clear how 
      values are incorporated into policy decision-making about health systems. The 
      challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and 
      financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This 
      is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin 
      American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what 
      conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA 
      countries. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for 
      this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written 
      in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy 
      process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. 
      Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One 
      researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured 
      summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles 
      to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of 
      agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS: We 
      identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We 
      identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been 
      used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework 
      has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the 
      health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments 
      adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); 
      (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a 
      transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational 
      values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make 
      decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four 
      factors). CONCLUSIONS: It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different 
      social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about 
      health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate 
      values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the 
      achievement of policy goals in health system financing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The 
      protocol was registered with PROSPERO, ID=CRD42017057049 .

TI  - The Moral Foundations of Child Health and Social Policies: A Critical 
      Interpretive Synthesis.
LID - 10.3390/children8010043 [doi]
LID - 43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Allusions to the uniqueness and value of childhood abound in 
      academic, lay, and policy discourse. However, little clarity exists on the values 
      that guide child health and social policy-making. We review extant academic 
      literature on the normative dimensions of child health and social policy to 
      provide foundations for the development of child-focused public policies. 
      METHODS: We conducted a critical interpretive synthesis of academic literature on 
      the normative dimensions of child health and social policy-making. We employed a 
      social constructivist lens to interpret emergent themes. Political theory on the 
      social construction of target populations served as a bridge between sociologies 
      of childhood and public policy analysis. RESULTS: Our database searches returned 
      14,658 unique articles; full text review yielded 72 relevant articles. Purposive 
      sampling of relevant literature complemented our electronic searches, adding 51 
      original articles, for a total of 123 articles. Our analysis of the literature 
      reveals three central themes: potential, rights, and risk. These themes retain 
      relevance in diverse policy domains. A core set of foundational concepts also 
      cuts across disciplines: well-being, participation, and best interests of the 
      child inform debate on the moral and legal dimensions of a gamut of child social 
      policies. Finally, a meta-theme of embedding encompasses the pervasive issue of a 
      child's place, in the family and in society, which is at the heart of much social 
      theory and applied analysis on children and childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Foundational 
      understanding of the moral language and dominant policy frames applied to 
      children can enrich analyses of social policies for children. Most societies 
      paint children as potent, vulnerable, entitled, and embedded. It is the admixture 
      of these elements in particular policy spheres, across distinct places and times, 
      that often determines the form of a given policy and societal reactions to it. 
      Subsequent work in this area will need to detail the degree and impact of 
      variance in the values mix attached to children across sociocultural contexts and 
      investigate tensions between what are and what ought to be the values that guide 
      social policy development for children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The practice of public and patient engagement (PPE) in health 
      technology assessment (HTA) has spread worldwide, yet gaps in knowledge remain. 
      We carried out an institutional ethnography of the Canadian Agency for Drugs and 
      Technologies in Health (CADTH) public and patient involvement in HTA. METHODS: 
      The research took place over 15 months and included observational work in the 
      institutional settings, text review, and interviews with individuals working for 
      or involved with the agency. RESULTS: We found that despite demonstrated 
      commitment to PPE, organizational history, governance structure, and practices 
      were impediments to a unified approach to PPE. Unclear role descriptions for 
      committee members and differences in philosophy and priority given to PPE across 
      the organization presented challenges to effective participation. The high degree 
      of value given to evidence-based principles at times conflicted with meaningful 
      integration of patient input. A lack of clear goals and processes, roles, and 
      differential treatment of evidence in PPE served to minimize the importance of 
      patient experiences and to displace their validity. An acknowledgment of 
      conflicts between multiple epistemic traditions at work within HTA activities may 
      strengthen organizational approaches to PPE. CONCLUSION: HTA organizations can 
      learn from this study by reflecting on the challenges described and the 
      recommendations offered to address them. We suggest solidifying CADTH's 
      commitment to PPE with clear agency-wide roles and direction, values, and 
      outcomes, a comprehensive framework, and policy and procedures. An acknowledgment 
      of diverse epistemic traditions, as well as leadership and expertise in PPE, will 
      strengthen CADTH's PPE activities and sustain its leadership position in the HTA 
      field.

TI  - Barriers to Equitable Public Participation in Health-System Priority Setting 
      Within the Context of Decentralization: The Case of Vulnerable Women in a Ugandan 
      District.
PG  - 1047-1057
LID - 10.34172/ijhpm.2020.256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Decentralization of healthcare decision-making in Uganda led to the 
      promotion of public participation. To facilitate this, participatory structures 
      have been developed at sub-national levels. However, the degree to which the 
      participation structures have contributed to improving the participation of 
      vulnerable populations, specifically vulnerable women, remains unclear. We aim to 
      understand whether and how vulnerable women participate in health-system priority 
      setting; identify any barriers to vulnerable women's participation; and to 
      establish how the barriers to vulnerable women's participation can be addressed. 
      METHODS: We used a qualitative description study design involving interviews with 
      district decision-makers (n=12), sub-county leaders (n=10), and vulnerable women 
      (n=35) living in Tororo District, Uganda. Data was collected between May and June 
      2017. The analysis was conducting using an editing analysis style. RESULTS: The 
      vulnerable women expressed interest in participating in priority setting, 
      believing they would make valuable contributions. However, both decision-makers 
      and vulnerable women reported that vulnerable women did not consistently 
      participate in decision-making, despite participatory structures that were 
      instituted through decentralization. There are financial (transportation and lack 
      of incentives), biomedical (illness/disability and menstruation), knowledge-based 
      (lack of knowledge and/or information about participation), motivational 
      (perceived disinterest, lack of feedback, and competing needs), socio-cultural 
      (lack of decision-making power), and structural (hunger and poverty) barriers 
      which hamper vulnerable women's participation. CONCLUSION: The identified 
      barriers hinder vulnerable women's participation in health-system priority 
      setting. Some of the barriers could be addressed through the existing 
      decentralization participatory structures. Respondents made both short-term, 
      feasible recommendations and more systemic, ideational recommendations to improve 
      vulnerable women's participation. Integrating the vulnerable women's creative and 
      feasible ideas to enhance their participation in health-system decision-making 
      should be prioritized.

TI  - Developing a Canadian evaluation framework for patient and public engagement in 
      research: study protocol.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public engagement (PPE) in research is growing 
      internationally, and with it, the interest for its evaluation. In Canada, the 
      Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research has generated national momentum and 
      opportunities for greater PPE in research and health-system transformation. As is 
      the case with most countries, the Canadian research community lacks a common 
      evaluation framework for PPE, thus limiting our capacity to ensure integrity 
      between principles and practices, learn across projects, identify common areas 
      for improvement, and assess the impacts of engagement. OBJECTIVE: This project 
      aims to build a national adaptable framework for the evaluation of PPE in 
      research, by: 1. Building consensus on common evaluation criteria and indicators 
      for PPE in research; 2. Defining recommendations to implement and adapt the 
      framework to specific populations. METHODS: Using a collaborative action-research 
      approach, a national coalition of patient-oriented research leaders, (patient and 
      community partners, engagement practitioners, researchers and health system 
      leaders) will co-design the evaluation framework. We will develop core evaluation 
      domains of the logic model by conducting a series of virtual consensus meetings 
      using a nominal group technique with 50 patient partners and engagement 
      practitioners, identified through 18 national research organizations. We will 
      then conduct two Delphi rounds to prioritize process and impact indicators with 
      200 participants purposely recruited to include respondents from seldom-heard 
      groups. Six expert working groups will define recommendations to implement and 
      adapt the framework to research with specific populations, including Indigenous 
      communities, immigrants, people with intellectual and physical disabilities, 
      caregivers, and people with low literacy. Each step of framework development will 
      be guided by an equity, diversity and inclusion approach in an effort to ensure 
      that the participants engaged, the content produced, and the adaptation 
      strategies proposed are relevant to diverse PPE. DISCUSSION: The potential 
      contributions of this project are threefold: 1) support a national learning 
      environment for engagement by offering a common blueprint for collaborative 
      evaluation to the Canadian research community; 2) inform the international 
      research community on potential (virtual) methodologies to build national 
      consensus on common engagement evaluation frameworks; and 3) illustrate a shared 
      attempt to engage patients and researchers in a strategic national initiative to 
      strengthen evaluation capacity for PPE.

      contradictions.
PG  - 177-94
LID - 10.1108/JHOM-07-2020-0292 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: In this paper, we contribute to the theorizing of patient involvement in 
      organizational improvement by exploring concepts of "learning from patients" as 
      mechanisms of organizational change. Using the concept of metaphor as a 
      theoretical bridge, we analyse interview data (n = 20) from participants in 
      patient engagement activities from two case study organizations in Ontario, 
      Canada. Inspired by classic organizational scholars, we ask "what is the 
      organization that it might learn from patients?" DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: 
      Patient involvement activities are used as part of quality improvement efforts in 
      healthcare organizations worldwide. One fundamental assumption underpinning this 
      activity is the notion that organizations must "learn from patients" in order to 
      enact positive organizational change. Despite this emphasis on learning, there is 
      a paucity of research that theorizes learning or connects concepts of learning to 
      organizational change within the domain of patient involvement. FINDINGS: Through 
      our analysis, we interpret a range of metaphors of the organization, including 
      organizations as (1) power and politics, (2) systems and (3) narratives. Through 
      these metaphors, we display a range of possibilities for interpreting how 
      organizations might learn from patients and associated implications for 
      organizational change. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This analysis has implications for how 
      the framing of the organization matters for concepts of learning in patient 
      engagement activities and how misalignments might stymie engagement efforts. We 
      argue that the concept and commitment to "learning from patients" would be 
      enriched by further engagement with the sociology of knowledge and critical 
      concepts from theories of organizational learning.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigate whether older adults who were newly diagnosed with 
      dementia (severity unspecified) and resided in an assisted living facility that 
      offered a dementia care program had a lower rate of transition to a nursing home, 
      compared to those who resided in an assisted living facility without such a 
      program. DESIGN: Population-based retrospective cohort study. SETTING AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: Linked, person-level health system administrative data on older 
      adults who were newly diagnosed with dementia and resided in an assisted living 
      facility in Ontario, Canada, from 2014 to 2019 (n = 977). METHODS: Access to a 
      dementia care program in an assisted living facility (n = 57) was examined. 
      Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression with robust standard errors 
      clustered on the assisted living facility was used to model the time to 
      transition to a nursing home from the new dementia diagnosis. RESULTS: There were 
      11.8 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility with a dementia care program, compared 
      with 20.5 transitions to a nursing home per 100 person-years among older adults 
      who resided in an assisted living facility without a dementia care program. After 
      adjustment for relevant characteristics at baseline, older adults who resided in 
      an assisted living facility with a dementia care program had a 40% lower rate of 
      transition to a nursing home (hazard ratio 0.60, 95% confidence interval 0.44, 
      0.81), compared with those in an assisted living facility without such a program 
      at any point during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The rate 
      of transition to a nursing home was significantly lower among older adults who 
      resided in an assisted living facility that offered a dementia care program. 
      These findings support the expansion of dementia care programs in assisted living 
      facilities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many residents of assisted living facilities live with dementia, but 
      little is known about the characteristics of assisted living facilities that 
      provide specialized care for older adults who live with dementia. In this study, 
      we identify the characteristics of assisted living facilities that offer a 
      dementia care program, compared to those that do not offer such a program. 
      METHODS: We conducted a population-level cross-sectional study on all licensed 
      assisted living facilities in Ontario, Canada in 2018 (n = 738). Facility-level 
      characteristics (e.g., resident and suite capacities, etc.) and the provision of 
      the other 12 provincially regulated care services (e.g., pharmacist and medical 
      services, skin and wound care, etc.) attributed to assisted living facilities 
      were examined. Multivariable Poisson regression with robust standard errors was 
      used to model the characteristics of assisted living facilities associated with 
      the provision of a dementia care program. RESULTS: There were 123 assisted living 
      facilities that offered a dementia care program (16.7% versus 83.3% no dementia 
      care). Nearly half of these facilities had a resident capacity exceeding 140 
      older adults (44.7% versus 21.6% no dementia care) and more than 115 suites 
      (46.3% versus 20.8% no dementia care). All assisted living facilities that 
      offered a dementia care program also offered nursing services, meals, assistance 
      with bathing and hygiene, and administered medications. After adjustment for 
      facility characteristics and other provincially regulated care services, the 
      prevalence of a dementia care program was nearly three times greater in assisted 
      living facilities that offered assistance with feeding (Prevalence Ratio [PR] 
      2.91, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.98 to 4.29), and almost twice as great among 
      assisted living facilities that offered medical services (PR 1.78, 95% CI 1.00 to 
      3.17), compared to those that did not. CONCLUSIONS: A dementia care program was 
      more prevalent in assisted living facilities that housed many older adults, had 
      many suites, and offered at least five of the other 12 regulated care services. 
      Our findings deepen the understanding of specialized care for dementia in 
      assisted living facilities.

TI  - Priority setting and equity in COVID-19 pandemic plans: a comparative analysis of 
      18 African countries.
PG  - 297-309
LID - 10.1093/heapol/czab113 [doi]
AB  - Priority setting represents an even bigger challenge during public health 
      emergencies than routine times. This is because such emergencies compete with 
      routine programmes for the available health resources, strain health systems and 
      shift health-care attention and resources towards containing the spread of the 
      epidemic and treating those that fall seriously ill. This paper is part of a 
      larger global study, the aim of which is to evaluate the degree to which national 
      COVID-19 preparedness and response plans incorporated priority setting concepts. 
      It provides important insights into what and how priority decisions were made in 
      the context of a pandemic. Specifically, with a focus on a sample of 18 African 
      countries' pandemic plans, the paper aims to: (1) explore the degree to which the 
      documented priority setting processes adhere to established quality indicators of 
      effective priority setting and (2) examine if there is a relationship between the 
      number of quality indicators present in the pandemic plans and the country's 
      economic context, health system and prior experiences with disease outbreaks. All 
      the reviewed plans contained some aspects of expected priority setting processes 
      but none of the national plans addressed all quality parameters. Most of the 
      parameters were mentioned by less than 10 of the 18 country plans reviewed, and 
      several plans identified one or two aspects of fair priority setting processes. 
      Very few plans identified equity as a criterion for priority setting. Since the 
      parameters are relevant to the quality of priority setting that is implemented 
      during public health emergencies and most of the countries have pre-existing 
      pandemic plans; it would be advisable that, for the future (if not already 
      happening), countries consider priority setting as a critical part of their 
      routine health emergency and disease outbreak plans. Such an approach would 
      ensure that priority setting is integral to pandemic planning, response and 
      recovery.

TI  - P300 amplitude during a monetary incentive delay task predicts future therapy 
      completion in individuals with major depressive disorder.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment effectiveness for major depressive disorder (MDD) is 
      often affected by client non-adherence, dropout, and non-response. Identification 
      of client characteristics predicting successful treatment completion and/or 
      response (i.e., symptom reduction) may be an important tool to increase 
      intervention effectiveness. It is unclear whether neural attenuations in reward 
      processing associated with MDD predict behavioral treatment outcome. METHODS: 
      This study aimed to determine whether blunted neural responses to reward at 
      baseline differentiate MDD (n = 60; 41 with comorbid anxiety) and healthy control 
      (HC; n = 40) groups; and predict MDD completion of and response to 7-10 sessions 
      of behavior therapy. Participants completed a monetary incentive delay (MID) 
      task. The N200, P300, contingent negative variation (CNV) event related 
      potentials (ERPs) and behavioral responses (reaction time [RT], correct hits) 
      were quantified and extracted for cross-sectional group analyses. ERPs and 
      behavioral responses demonstrating group differences were then used to predict 
      therapy completion and response within MDD. RESULTS: MDD exhibited faster RT and 
      smaller P300 amplitudes than HC across conditions. Within the MDD group, 
      treatment completers (n = 37) exhibited larger P300 amplitudes than 
      non-completers (n = 21). LIMITATIONS: This study comprises secondary analyses of 
      EEG data; thus task parameters are not optimized to examine feedback ERPs from 
      the paradigm. We did not examine heterogenous presentations of MDD; however, 
      severity and comorbidity did not influence findings. CONCLUSIONS: Previous 
      studies suggest that P300 is an index of motivational salience and stimulus 
      resource allocation. In sum, individuals who deploy greater neural resources to 
      task demands are more likely to persevere in behavioral therapy.

TI  - The impact of COVID-19 on patient engagement in the health system: Results from a 
      Pan-Canadian survey of patient, family and caregiver partners.
PG  - 744-753
LID - 10.1111/hex.13421 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on all aspects of the 
      health system. Little is known about how the activities and experiences of 
      patient, family and caregiver partners, as a large group across a variety of 
      settings within the health system, changed due to the substantial health system 
      shifts catalysed by the pandemic. This paper reports on the results of a survey 
      that included questions about this topic. METHODS: Canadian patient, family and 
      caregiver partners were invited to participate in an online anonymous survey in 
      the Fall of 2020. A virtual snowballing approach to recruitment was used. Survey 
      invitations were shared on social media and emailed to health system and 
      governmental organizations with the request that they share the survey with 
      patient partners. This paper focuses on responses to two questions related to 
      patient partner experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The COVID-19 
      questions were completed by 533 respondents. Over three quarters of respondents 
      (77.9%, n = 415) indicated their patient engagement activities had been impacted 
      by COVID-19. The majority (62.5%, n = 230) experienced at least a temporary or 
      partial reduction in their patient engagement activities. Some respondents did 
      see increases in their patient engagement activities (11.4%, n = 42). Many 
      respondents provided insights into their experience with virtual platforms for 
      engagement (n = 194), most expressed negative or mixed experiences with this 
      shift. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a snapshot of Canadian patient, family 
      and caregiver partners' perspectives on the impact of COVID-19 on their 
      engagement activities. Understanding how engagement unfolded during a crisis is 
      critical for our future planning if patient engagement is to be fully integrated 
      into the health system. Identifying how patient partners were engaged and not 
      engaged during this time period, as well as the benefits and challenges of 
      virtual engagement opportunities, offers instructive lessons for sustaining 
      patient engagement, including the supports needed to engage with a more diverse 
      set of patient, family and caregiver partners. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient 
      partners were important members of the Canadian Patient Partner Study research 
      team. They were engaged from the outset, participating in all stages of the 
      research project. Additional patient partners were engaged to develop and pilot 
      test the survey, and all survey respondents were patient, family or caregiver 
      partners. The manuscript is coauthored by two patient partners.

TI  - Mechanisms of Cardiometabolic Health Outcomes and Disparities: What

PG  - 448-459
LID - 10.1177/08982643221085903 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Chronic stressors are associated with cardiometabolic health 
      conditions and disparities. Mechanisms linking stressors and health remain poorly 
      understood. Methods: Two cohort studies (Cardiac Rehabilitation And The 
      Experience [CREATE] and Tracking Risk Identification for Adult Diabetes [TRIAD]) 
      with harmonized variables were used to examine relationships between six types of 
      chronic stressors in adulthood and Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis 
      dysregulation, as indicated by blunted diurnal cortisol slopes, which are 
      stress-sensitive biomarkers implicated in cardiometabolic health (merged N = 213, 
      mean age 61, 18% Black). A secondary aim was to explore whether these chronic 
      stressors accounted for Black-White disparities in HPA axis regulation. Results: 
      Some chronic stressors were linked to HPA axis dysregulation, with recent 
      stressors most salient (b = 0.00353, SE = 0.00133, p = .008). Black-White 
      disparities in HPA axis regulation persisted after controlling for racial 
      differences in chronic stressors, which reduced the disparity 11.46%. Discussion: 
      Chronic stressors in adulthood may increase risk for HPA axis dysregulation and 
      associated cardiometabolic health outcomes but may not be a key factor in racial 
      disparities.

      Anxiety Disorders in Black Men and Women, 50 Years of Age and Older.
PG  - 378-389
LID - 10.1177/08982643221086065 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: To examine anxiety disorders in aging Black adults. Methods: Using 
      nationally representative data from the National Survey of American Life, we 
      estimated lifetime/12-month prevalence of anxiety disorders in Black men and 
      women, age 50+ (N = 1561). Disorder-specific persistence and severity, functional 
      impairment, and mental health service utilization were investigated using 
      multivariate regressions. Results: Black men and women who met criteria for 
      anxiety disorders (lifetime prevalence=12.4%/18.3% in men/women) also 
      demonstrated persistent disorders (percent meeting criteria = 40.3%-61.2%). Those 
      with a 12-month anxiety disorder (6.2%/10.5% of men/women) typically reported 
      severe task interference (38.3%-85.7%). Those with any 12-month anxiety disorder, 
      compared to those without, experienced greater impairment in days out of role, 
      work, family burden, cognition and, in women, mobility (p's < .05). Only 
      47.0%/65.2% of Black men/women with any lifetime anxiety disorder used mental 
      health services. Discussion: Despite low prevalence, older Blacks with anxiety 
      disorders experience substantial mental health burden in middle age and later.

AB  - Objectives: To examine post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among Black adults 
      in younger, middle, and older ages. Methods: Using nationally representative data 
      from the National Survey of American Life, we estimated lifetime and 12-month 
      prevalence of PTSD in Black men and women ages 18-34, 35-49, and 50+. We 
      determined PTSD persistence and severity by age group, then associations of PTSD 
      with socio-economic status, chronic stress, and racial discrimination in middle 
      age. Results: The lifetime prevalence of PTSD was higher in Black women/men ages 
      18-34 (prevalence=14.0%/6.3%) and 35-49 (12.8%/4.6%) versus 50 and older 
      (8.7%/5.1%). Those ages 35-49 were more likely than younger/older Black adults to 
      have severe interference in work, relationships, and activities domains. In 
      middle age, PTSD was associated with unemployment, lower education, poverty, and 
      stress in Black men, and unemployment, divorce, poverty, stress, and 
      discrimination in Black women. Discussion: Black women experience a 
      disproportionate burden of PTSD in middle age.

TI  - Rates of health services use among residents of retirement homes in Ontario: a 
      population-based cohort study.
PG  - E730-E738
LID - 10.1503/cmaj.211883 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Because there are no standardized reporting systems specific to 
      residents of retirement homes in North America, little is known about the health 
      of this distinct population of older adults. We evaluated rates of health 
      services use by residents of retirement homes relative to those of residents of 
      long-term care homes and other populations of older adults. METHODS: We conducted 
      a retrospective cohort study using population health administrative data from 
      2018 on adults 65 years or older in Ontario. We matched the postal codes of 
      individuals to those of licensed retirement homes to identify residents of 
      retirement homes. Outcomes included rates of hospital-based care and physician 
      visits. RESULTS: We identified 54 733 residents of 757 retirement homes (mean age 
      86.7 years, 69.0% female) and 2 354 385 residents of other settings. Compared to 
      residents of long-term care homes, residents of retirement homes had 
      significantly higher rates per 1000 person months of emergency department visits 
      (10.62 v. 4.48, adjusted relative rate [RR] 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 
      2.55 to 2.67), hospital admissions (5.42 v. 2.08, adjusted RR 2.77, 95% CI 2.71 
      to 2.82), alternate level of care (ALC) days (6.01 v. 2.96, adjusted RR 1.51, 95% 
      CI 1.48 to 1.54), and specialist physician visits (6.27 v. 3.21, adjusted RR 
      1.64, 95% CI 1.61 to 1.68), but a significantly lower rate of primary care visits 
      (16.71 v. 108.47, adjusted RR 0.13, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.14). INTERPRETATION: 
      Residents of retirement homes are a distinct population with higher rates of 
      hospital-based care. Our findings can help to inform policy debates about the 
      need for more coordinated primary and supportive health care in privately 
      operated congregate care homes.

TI  - Designing and Implementing Deliberative Processes for Health Technology 
      Assessment: A Good Practices Report of a Joint HTAi/ISPOR Task Force.
PG  - e37
LID - 10.1017/S0266462322000198 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Deliberative processes for health technology assessment (HTA) are 
      intended to facilitate participatory decision making, using discussion and open 
      dialogue between stakeholders. Increasing attention is being given to 
      deliberative processes, but guidance is lacking for those who wish to design or 
      use them. Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi) and ISPOR-The 
      Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research initiated a joint 
      Task Force to address this gap. METHODS: The joint Task Force consisted of 
      fifteen members with different backgrounds, perspectives, and expertise relevant 
      to the field. It developed guidance and a checklist for deliberative processes 
      for HTA. The guidance builds upon the few, existing initiatives in the field, as 
      well as input from the HTA community following an established consultation plan. 
      In addition, the guidance was subject to two rounds of peer review. RESULTS: A 
      deliberative process for HTA consists of procedures, activities, and events that 
      support the informed and critical examination of an issue and the weighing of 
      arguments and evidence to guide a subsequent decision. Guidance and an 
      accompanying checklist are provided for (i) developing the governance and 
      structure of an HTA program and (ii) informing how the various stages of an HTA 
      process might be managed using deliberation. CONCLUSIONS: The guidance and the 
      checklist contain a series of questions, grouped by six phases of a model 
      deliberative process. They are offered as practical tools for those wishing to 
      establish or improve deliberative processes for HTA that are fit for local 
      contexts. The tools can also be used for independent scrutiny of deliberative 
      processes.

TI  - Morning light treatment for traumatic stress: The role of amygdala reactivity 
      study protocol.
PG  - e0269502

LID - e0269502
AB  - BACKGROUND: Exposure to trauma can result in various mental health disorders 
      including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although 
      psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies exist for the treatment of these disorders, 
      many individuals fail to receive treatment and among those who do, many remain 
      symptomatic. Therefore, it is critical to continue developing new interventions 
      for traumatic stress that target underlying mechanisms of pathology and offer a 
      safe and acceptable alternative to current treatments. Morning light treatment 
      has good potential as a novel non-invasive, low risk treatment for traumatic 
      stress. Evidence suggests that morning light may improve traumatic stress by 
      reducing reactivity in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in the 
      pathophysiology of PTSD and anatomically linked to circadian photoreceptors in 
      the eye. METHODS: In this study, we aim to establish a significant dose-response 
      relationship between duration of morning light treatment and reduction in 
      amygdala reactivity among individuals with traumatic stress symptoms (NCT# 
      04117347). Using a transdiagnostic approach, sixty-six individuals with a history 
      of a DSM-5 criterion A trauma and traumatic stress symptoms will be recruited to 
      participate in a 5-week study. Participants will be randomized across three 
      treatment arms based on morning light treatment duration: 15-minutes, 30-minutes, 
      or 60-minutes of light treatment per day for four weeks. To evaluate amygdala 
      activity, participants will undergo fMRI at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and 
      post-treatment. Participants will also complete clinical assessments and 
      self-report measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety at pre-treatment, 
      mid-treatment, and post-treatment. DISCUSSION: Morning light therapy may be an 
      acceptable, feasible, and effective treatment for individuals suffering from 
      traumatic stress. Identifying mechanistically relevant targets, and the doses 
      needed to impact them, are critical steps in developing this new treatment 
      approach for the sequelae of traumatic stress.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In this study, we (1) identify the terms used to describe the 
      assisted living sector and the legislation governing operation in all Canadian 
      provinces and territories; (2) identify the cost estimates associated with 
      residency in these homes; and (3) quantify the growth of the sector. DESIGN: 
      Environmental scan. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Internet searches of Canadian 
      provincial and territorial government websites and professional associations were 
      conducted in 2021 to retrieve publicly accessible sources related to the assisted 
      living sector. METHODS: We synthesized data that identified the terms used to 
      describe the sector in all provinces and territories, the legislation governing 
      operation, financing, median fees per month for care, and growth of the sector 
      from 2012 to 2020. Counts and proportions were calculated for some extracted 
      variables. All data were narratively synthesized. RESULTS: The terms used to 
      describe the assisted living sector varied across Canada. The terms "assisted 
      living," "retirement homes," and "supportive living" were prevalent. Ontario was 
      the only province to regulate the sector through an independent, not-for-profit 
      organization. Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta had some of the highest 
      median fees for room, board, and care per month (range: $1873 to $6726). The 
      licensed assisted living sector in Ontario doubled in size (768 in 2020 vs 383 in 
      2012), and there was a threefold increase in the number of corporate-owned chain 
      assisted living facilities (465 in 2020 vs 142 in 2012). CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: The rapid growth of the assisted living sector that is primarily 
      financed through out-of-pocket payments may indicate a rise in a two-tier system 
      of housing and health care for older adults. Policymakers need better mechanisms, 
      such as standardized reporting systems and assessments, to understand the needs 
      of older adults who reside in assisted living facilities and inform the need for 
      sector regulation and oversight.

TI  - Understanding the Conceptualization and Operationalization of Trauma-Informed 
      Care Within and Across Systems: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis.
PG  - 785-853
LID - 10.1111/1468-0009.12579 [doi]
AB  - Policy Points In order to achieve successful operationalization of 
      trauma-informed care (TIC), TIC policies must include conceptual clarity 
      regarding the definition of both trauma and TIC. Furthermore, TIC requires clear 
      and cohesive policies that address operational factors such as clearly delineated 
      roles of service providers, protocol for positive trauma screens, necessary 
      financial infrastructure, and mechanisms of intersectoral collaboration. 
      Additionally, policy procedures need to be considered for how TIC is provided at 
      the program and service level as well as what TIC means at the organizational, 
      system, and intersectoral level. CONTEXT: Increased recognition of the 
      epidemiology of trauma and its impact on individuals within and across human 
      service delivery systems has contributed to the development of trauma-informed 
      care (TIC). How TIC can be conceptualized and implemented, however, remains 
      unclear. This study seeks to review and analyze the TIC literature from within 
      and across systems of care and to generate a conceptual framework regarding TIC. 
      METHODS: Our study followed a critical interpretive synthesis methodology. We 
      searched multiple databases (Campbell Collaboration, Econlit, Health Systems 
      Evidence, Embase, ERIC, HealthSTAR, IPSA, JSTOR, Medline, PsychINFO, Social 
      Sciences Abstracts, Sociological Abstracts and Web of Science),as well as 
      relevant gray literature and information-rich websites. We used a coding tool, 
      adapted to the TIC literature, for data extraction. FINDINGS: Electronic database 
      searches yielded 2,439 results and after inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
      applied, a purposive sample of 98 information-rich articles was generated. 
      Conceptual clarity and definitional understanding of TIC is lacking in the 
      literature, which has led to poor operationalization of TIC. Additionally, 
      infrastructural and ideological barriers, such as insufficient funding and 
      service provider "buy-in," have hindered TIC implementation. The resulting 
      conceptual framework defines trauma and depicts critical elements of vertical 
      TIC, including the bidirectional relationship between the trauma-affected 
      individual and the system, and horizontal TIC, which requires intersectoral 
      collaboration, an established referral network, and standardized TIC language. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Successful operationalization of TIC requires policies that address 
      current gaps in systems arrangements, such as the lack of funding structures for 
      TIC, and political factors, such as the role of policy legacies. The emergent 
      conceptual framework acknowledges critical factors affecting operationalization.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The unique evidentiary, economic and ethical challenges associated 
      with health technology assessment (HTA) of precision therapies limit access to 
      novel drugs and therapeutics for children and youth, for whom such challenges are 
      amplified. We elicited citizens' perspectives about values-based criteria 
      relevant to the assessment of paediatric precision therapies to inform the 
      development of a child-tailored HTA framework. METHODS: We held four citizen 
      panels virtually in May-June 2021, informed by a plain-language citizen brief 
      summarizing global and local evidence about the challenges, policy and 
      programmatic options and implementation strategies related to enhancing access to 
      precision therapies for Canadian children and youth. Panellists were recruited 
      through a nationally representative database, medical/patient networks and social 
      media. We inductively coded and thematically analysed panel transcripts to 
      generate themes and identify priority values. RESULTS: The perspectives of 
      panellists (n = 45) coalesced into four overlapping themes, with attendant 
      subthemes, relevant to a child-tailored HTA framework: (1) Childhood 
      Distinctions: vulnerability, 'fair innings', future potential, family impacts; 
      (2) Voice: agency of children and youth; lived versus no lived experience; (3) 
      One versus Many: disease severity, rarity, equity, unmet need and (4) Health 
      System Governance: funding, implementation inequities, effectiveness and safety. 
      Participants broadly agreed that childhood distinctions, particularly family 
      impacts, justify child-tailored HTA. Dissent arose over whose voice should inform 
      HTA and how such perspectives are best incorporated. CONCLUSIONS: Citizens can 
      offer unique insights into criteria relevant to the development or revision of 
      HTA frameworks to capture holistic, societally responsive dimensions of value 
      attached to unique contexts or populations, including children. Balancing the 
      hopes and expectations of patients and caregivers for access to expensive but 
      potential life-altering therapies against the opportunity costs borne by 
      encompassing health systems is a fundamental challenge that will require rigorous 
      methods to elicit, weigh and reconcile varied views. PATIENT OR PUBLIC 
      CONTRIBUTION: A patient advocate served on the steering committee of this study 
      and co-authored this article. Key informants for the Citizen Brief included 
      patient advocates and caregivers; a separate patient advocate reviewed the Brief 
      before dissemination. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from the 
      general public and caregivers of children, with written consent.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the sociodemographic characteristics, activities, 
      motivations, experiences, skills and challenges of patient partners working 
      across multiple health system settings in Canada. DESIGN: Online cross-sectional 
      survey of self-identified patient partners. SETTING: Patient partners in multiple 
      jurisdictions and health system organisations. PARTICIPANTS: 603 patient partners 
      who had drawn on their experiences with the health system as a patient, family 
      member or informal caregiver to try to improve it in some way, through their 
      involvement in the activities of a group, organisation or government. RESULTS: 
      Survey respondents predominantly identified as female (76.6%), white (84%) and 
      university educated (70.2%) but were a heterogeneous group in the scope 
      (activities and organisations), intensity (number of hours) and longevity (number 
      of years) of their role. Primary motivations for becoming a patient partner were 
      the desire to improve the health system based on either a negative (36.2%) or 
      positive (23.3%) experience. Respondents reported feeling enthusiastic (83.6%), 
      valued (76.9%) and needed (63.3%) always or most of the time; just under half 
      felt they had always or often been adequately compensated in their role. 
      Knowledge of the health system and the organisation they partner with are key 
      skills needed. Two-thirds faced barriers in their role with over half identifying 
      power imbalances. Less than half were able to see how their input was reflected 
      in decisions or changes always or most of the time, and 40.3% had thought about 
      quitting. CONCLUSIONS: This survey is the first of its kind to examine at a 
      population level, the characteristics, experiences and dynamics of a large sample 
      of self-identified patient partners. Patient partners in this sample are a 
      sociodemographically homogenous group, yet heterogeneous in the scope, intensity 
      and longevity of roles. Our findings provide key insights at a critical time, to 
      inform the future of patient partnership in health systems.

      review and descriptive synthesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: With the sharp increase in the involvement of patients (including 
      family and informal caregivers) as active participants, collaborators, advisors 
      and decision-makers in health systems, a new role has emerged: the patient 
      partner. The role of patient partner differs from other forms of patient 
      engagement in its longitudinal and bidirectional nature. This systematic review 
      describes extant work on how patient partners are conceptualized and engaged in 
      health systems. In doing so, it furthers the understanding of the role and 
      activities of patient partners, and best practices for future patient partnership 
      activities. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of peer-reviewed 
      literature published in English or French that describes patient partner roles 
      between 2000 and 2021 in any country or sector of the health system. We used a 
      broad search strategy to capture descriptions of longitudinal patient engagement 
      that may not have used words such as "partner" or "advisor". RESULTS: A total of 
      506 eligible papers were identified, representing patient partnership activities 
      in mostly high-income countries. These studies overwhelmingly described patient 
      partnership in health research. We identified clusters of literature about 
      patient partnership in cancer and mental health. The literature is saturated with 
      single-site descriptive studies of patient partnership on individual projects or 
      initiatives. There is a lack of work synthesizing impacts, facilitating factors 
      and outcomes of patient partnership in healthcare. CONCLUSIONS: There is not yet 
      a consolidated understanding of the role, activities or impacts of patient 
      partners. Advancement of the literature has been stymied by a lack of 
      consistently used terminology. The literature is ready to move beyond single-site 
      descriptions, and synthesis of existing pockets of high-quality theoretical work 
      will be essential to this evolution.

TI  - Development of the Engage with Impact Toolkit: A comprehensive resource to 
      support the evaluation of patient, family and caregiver engagement in health 
      systems.
PG  - 1255-1265
LID - 10.1111/hex.13742 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent shifts in the patient, family and caregiver engagement field 
      have focused greater attention on measurement and evaluation, including the 
      impacts of engagement efforts. Current evaluation tools offer limited support to 
      organizations seeking to reorient their efforts in this way. We addressed this 
      gap through the development of an impact measurement framework and accompanying 
      evaluation toolkit-the Engage with Impact Toolkit. METHODS: The measurement 
      framework and toolkit were co-designed with the Evaluating Patient Engagement 
      Working Group, a multidisciplinary group of patient, family and caregiver 
      partners, engagement specialists, researchers and government personnel. Project 
      activities occurred over four phases: (1) project scoping and literature review; 
      (2) modified concept mapping; (3) working group deliberations and (4) toolkit web 
      design. RESULTS: The project scope was to develop a measurement framework and an 
      evaluation toolkit for patient engagement in health systems that were practical, 
      accessible, menu-driven and aligned with current system priorities. Concept 
      mapping yielded 237 impact statements that were sorted, discussed and combined 
      into 81 unique items. A shorter list of 50 items (rated 8.0 or higher out of 10) 
      was further consolidated to generate a final list of 35 items mapped across 8 
      conceptual domains of impact: (1) knowledge and skills; (2) confidence and trust; 
      (3) equity and inclusivity; (4) priorities and decisions; (5) effectiveness and 
      efficiency; (6) patient-centredness; (7) culture change and (8) patient outcomes 
      and experience. Working Group members rated the final list for importance (1-5) 
      and identified a core set of 33 items (one for each of the 8 domains and 25 
      supplementary items). Two domains (priorities and decisions; and culture change) 
      yielded the highest overall importance ratings (4.8). A web-based toolkit 
      (www.evaluateengagement.ca) hosts the measurement framework and related 
      evaluation supports. CONCLUSION: The Engage with Impact Toolkit builds on 
      existing engagement evaluation tools but brings a more explicit focus to 
      supporting organizations to assess the impacts of their engagement work. PATIENT 
      CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver partners led the early 
      conceptualization of this work and were involved at all stages and in all aspects 
      of the work. As end-users of the toolkit, their perspectives, knowledge and 
      opinions were critical.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is a pan-Canadian research network 
      focused on innovating and improving the quality and delivery of pain prevention, 
      assessment, management and research for all Canadians. An important focus of the 
      CPN is to work in collaboration with patient partners. Patient partners, 
      researchers and clinicians work together in all aspects of the research network 
      including on funded research projects and in the governance of the Network. Given 
      this focus, the CPN identified the importance of evaluating their patient 
      engagement work to understand its functioning and impact. METHODS: The objective 
      of this exploratory evaluation case study was to understand the impacts of 
      patient engagement on the CPN. The CPN worked with an external evaluation team 
      which established an arms-length approach to the evaluation. Interviews were 
      conducted with CPN members, including patient partners, leadership, funded 
      researchers and committee co-chairs, at three discrete time points to trace the 
      evolution of the patient engagement program within the Network. Key Network 
      documents were also collected and reviewed. Data were analyzed following each set 
      of interviews using content analysis guided by the principles of constant 
      comparison and qualitative description. A final round of analysis was conducted 
      using the Engage with Impact Toolkit, an impact measurement framework, to 
      identify impacts of engagement. RESULTS: Impacts of patient engagement were 
      identified at the individual, network, funded research project and research 
      community levels. These impacts were observed in the following areas: (1) 
      building community; (2) developing knowledge, skills and resources; (3) 
      increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and decisions; (5) enabling 
      additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; and, (7) coping with 
      experiences of living with chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: While not without 
      challenges, the patient engagement efforts of the CPN demonstrates the impact 
      engaging patient partners can have on a national research network and related 
      policy activities. Understanding the approaches to, and impacts of, patient 
      engagement on health research networks can illuminate the value of having patient 
      partners engaged in all aspects of a research network and should serve as 
      encouragement to others who look to take on similar work.

OAB - The Chronic Pain Network (CPN) is one of a group of research networks that was 
      funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to support 
      patient-oriented research in chronic diseases. From the beginning of its work, 
      the CPN has included patients as partners. Patient partners are co-chairs of all 
      Network governance committees, funded projects are required to include patient 
      partners in their work and there is a committee dedicated to engagement, the 
      Patient Engagement (PE) committee. The PE Committee determined that it was 
      important to evaluate how the CPN was engaging with patient partners and 
      collaborated with the Public and Patient Engagement Collaborative (PPEC) to 
      evaluate this work. The PPEC, along with members of the PE Committee, identified 
      understanding the impact of patient engagement as an important part of the 
      evaluation. This paper provides a description of the impacts of patient 
      engagement on the people who were involved in the CPN, on the CPN's work and way 
      of being, and on the broader pain research community. Based on the results from 
      three sets of interviews and review of Network documents, we share impacts 
      identified in seven areas: (1) building community; (2) developing knowledge, 
      skills and resources; (3) increasing confidence; (4) influencing priorities and 
      decisions; (5) enabling additional opportunities; (6) promoting culture change; 
      and, (7) coping with experiences of living with chronic pain. This research shows 
      us the impact that engaging patient partners can have on a national research 
      network, and the areas where greater focus could, perhaps, lead to even greater 
      impacts in future networks.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of engaging older adults and service providers as research 
      partners in the co-design of a community mobility-promoting program: a mixed 
      methods developmental evaluation study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasingly researchers are partnering with citizens and communities 
      in research; less is known about research impacts of this engagement. EMBOLDEN is 
      an evidence-informed, mobility-promoting intervention for older adults 
      co-designed by a 26-person Strategic Guiding Council (SGC) of health/social 
      service providers and older adult citizens. This study evaluated research 
      partners' perceptions of engagement strategies, the engagement context, 
      strengths, areas for improvement, as well as the impacts of the guiding council 
      on older-adult identified priority areas. METHODS: This study was guided by 
      developmental evaluation, working in partnership with four older adult SGC 
      members who helped to set evaluation priorities, decide methods, and adapt 
      patient-centred evaluation tools. Data sources included a questionnaire, focus 
      groups and document analysis of meeting notes from 16 SGC meetings that took 
      place between December 2019 and February 2022. A thematic approach to analysis 
      guided the coding of focus group transcripts and SGC meeting notes. Convergent 
      mixed methods guided the integration and presentation of qualitative and 
      quantitative data sources in a joint display of evaluation results. RESULTS: Of 
      26 SGC members, nine completed the evaluation squestionnaire, and five 
      participated in focus groups. Around two thirds of the SGC commonly attended each 
      meeting. EMBOLDEN's SGC was structured to include a diverse group (across gender, 
      ethnicity and discipline) of older adults and service providers, which was 
      perceived as a strength. Engagement processes were perceived as inclusive and 
      well-facilitated, which stimulated discussion at meetings. Advantages and 
      disadvantages of engaging with the SGC virtually, as compared to in-person (as 
      was the case for the first 3 SGC meetings) were also discussed. Impacts of the 
      SGC were identified across preparatory, execution phase and translational stages 
      of research. Impacts of SGC involvement on members were also described. 
      CONCLUSION: Older adult research partners played an important role designing, 
      implementing, and evaluating co-design approaches in this study. Older adults and 
      service providers can make important contributions to the design, delivery and 
      sharing results of health research through their lived expertise and connections 
      to community. This project contributes to the growing field of citizen and 
      community engagement in research by offering a participatory approach to 
      engagement evaluation that considers diversity, satisfaction, and impact.

OAB - It is becoming common for researchers to ask patients and caregivers to become 
      involved with their studies as partners. By partnering with people who have 
      first-hand experience with a condition, researchers hope their studies will be 
      more relevant, run efficiently and have more impact than studies designed by 
      researchers alone. Over the last twenty years, there has been a significant 
      increase in the number of published papers that involve patients and caregivers, 
      but few papers mention what changed because of this involvement. Researchers need 
      to know the best ways to involve patients and caregivers and the impact of doing 
      so.This study aimed to find out how a council of older adults (OAs) and service 
      providers (SPs) impacted a study about collaboratively designing and testing a 
      mobility intervention. This study aimed to find out how council members felt 
      about their involvement in this study, by asking them what went well and what 
      could have been improved.This study used a questionnaire, focus groups and 
      analyzed council meeting notes to inform this study. Four OA council members 
      helped design the study, decide research methods, and adapt wording of questions 
      (focus groups, questionnaire). Between 19% and 35% of council members completed 
      evaluation activities. They felt the study strengths were the diversity of the 
      council, and a welcoming environment for discussion. The council impacted how the 
      study was designed, carried out and how results were shared. Results from this 
      study can improve patient partnership engagement, experiences, and impacts in 
      future studies.

TI  - A global comparative analysis of the the inclusion of priority setting in 
      national COVID-19 pandemic plans: A reflection on the methods and the 
      accessibility of the plans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the swift governments' response to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
      there remains a paucity of literature assessing the degree to which; priority 
      setting (PS) was included in the pandemic plans and the pandemic plans were 
      publicly accessible. This paper reflects on the methods employed in a global 
      comparative analysis of the degree to which countries integrated PS into their 
      COVID-19 pandemic plans based on Kapiriri & Martin's framework. We also assessed 
      if the accessibility of the plans was related to the country's transparency 
      index. METHODS: Through a three stage search strategy, we accessed and reviewed 
      86 national COVID-19 pandemic plans (and 11 Canadian provinces and territories). 
      Secondary analysis assessed any alignment between the readily accessible plans 
      and the country's transparency index. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: 71 national plans 
      were readily accessible while 43 were not. There were no systematic differences 
      between the countries whose plans were readily available and those whose plans 
      were 'missing'. However, most of the countries with 'missing' plans tended to 
      have a low transparency index. The framework was adapted to the pandemic context 
      by adding a parameter on the need to plan for continuity of priority routine 
      services. While document review may be the most feasible and appropriate approach 
      to conducting policy analysis during health emergencies, interviews and follow up 
      document review would assess policy implementation.

AB  - Stakeholder participation is a key component of a fair and equitable 
      priority-setting in health. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for fair 
      and equitable priority setting, and hence, stakeholder participation. To date, 
      there is limited literature on stakeholder participation in the development of 
      the pandemic plans (including the priority setting plans) that were rapidly 
      developed during the pandemic. Drawing on a global study of national COVID-19 
      preparedness and response plans, we present a secondary analysis of COVID-19 
      national plans from 70 countries from the six WHO regions, focusing on 
      stakeholder participation. We found that most plans were prepared by the Ministry 
      of Health and acknowledged WHO guidance, however less than half mentioned that 
      additional stakeholders were involved. Few plans described a strategy for 
      stakeholder participation and/or accounted for public participation in the plan 
      preparation. However, diverse stakeholders (including multiple governmental, 
      non-governmental, and international organizations) were proposed to participate 
      in the implementation of the plans. Overall, there was a lack of transparency 
      about who participated in decision-making and limited evidence of meaningful 
      participation of the community, including marginalized groups. The critical 
      relevance of stakeholder participation in priority setting requires that 
      governments develop strategies for meaningful participation of diverse 
      stakeholders during pandemics such as COVID-19, and in routine healthcare 
      priority setting.

TI  - Patient perspectives on pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for antidepressant 
      prescribing in primary care: a qualitative description study.
PG  - 293-309
LID - 10.1007/s12687-024-00705-y [doi]
AB  - Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) try multiple antidepressants 
      before finding one that works well and is tolerable. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) 
      testing was developed to facilitate more efficacious prescribing. This technology 
      has not been robustly implemented clinically. Patient perspectives are critical 
      to policy decisions, but the views of patients with MDD about the use of PGx 
      testing to guide antidepressant prescribing have not been extensively examined, 
      particularly in publicly funded healthcare systems. The purpose of this 
      qualitative description study was to produce actionable patient perspectives 
      evidence to inform future technology assessment of PGx testing. We conducted 
      semi-structured interviews with 21 adults with MDD for which antidepressants were 
      indicated in Ontario, Canada, and used the Ontario Decision Determinants 
      Framework to conduct an unconstrained deductive content analysis. Patients 
      expressed views about the overall clinical benefit of PGx testing in depression 
      care, preferences for deployment of testing, perspectives on ethical 
      considerations, opinions about equity and patient care, and beliefs regarding the 
      feasibility of adopting PGx testing into the healthcare system. They also worried 
      about the possibility of conflicts of interest between PGx test manufacturers and 
      pharmaceutical companies. This study provides policymakers with patient 
      priorities to facilitate the development of patient-centred policies. It 
      highlights that formal adoption of PGx testing into the healthcare system 
      requires a focus on equity of access and health outcomes.

AB  - Engagement of patients and the public in health research is crucial for ensuring 
      research relevance and alignment with community needs. However, there is a lack 
      of nuanced evaluations and examples that promote collaborative and reflective 
      learning about partnerships with partners. The aim of this paper is to provide a 
      case example of a participatory evaluation of the engagement of older adult 
      partners in an aging-focused research centre. We outline our process of 
      co-planning and implementing an evaluation of the McMaster Collaborative for 
      Health and Aging's engagement strategy through the use of multiple methods, 
      including a standardized tool and qualitative approaches. The team chose to 
      explore and capture the engagement experiences and perspectives of the older 
      adult partners within the Collaborative using a survey (the Public and Patient 
      Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET)), an art-based method (photovoice), and a 
      focus group. We present a brief summary of the findings but primarily focus this 
      paper on the experiences of using each methodology and tool, with an emphasis on 
      promoting dialogue on the benefits, limitations, and challenges. We reflect on 
      the process of co-planning and the integration of both standardized tools and 
      qualitative approaches to adopt a holistic approach to evaluating partnership 
      within the Collaborative. Ultimately, this case example aims to provide practical 
      guidance for other research groups navigating the complexities of partnership 
      engagement and evaluation, thereby promoting meaningful partnerships in research.

OAB - Engaging older adults in research is important to match research study goals with 
      older adult needs and interests and can lead to better health outcomes and a more 
      equitable healthcare system. Yet, older adults are often excluded from research 
      due to the idea that they can be a challenging group with whom to work. The 
      McMaster Collaborative for Health and Aging is a provincial research centre 
      established to engage patients, researchers, and other key partners to improve 
      the health of and the healthcare system for older adults. The Collaborative 
      partners with older adults and caregivers in all its activities and projects. For 
      example, older adults mentor students and advise on patient-partnered research 
      projects and co-facilitate workshops. There are many frameworks and models to 
      support research partnerships with people with lived experience. Yet, evaluating 
      the quality and impacts of these partnerships is less common. This paper presents 
      a case example of a participatory evaluation of older adult partners' engagement 
      in the Collaborative. Together, older adult partners and researchers decided on 
      the project goals and methods. The evaluation used multiple methods to capture 
      partners' experiences and perspectives on the process and impact of their 
      engagement in research. First, a survey called the Public and Patient Engagement 
      Evaluation Tool (PPEET) was completed. Second, photovoice was used (a method 
      involving photography for self-expression). Finally, a focus group was conducted 
      (discussions with partners facilitated by researchers). We reflect on the 
      benefits and limitations of each method and make recommendations for future 
      evaluations. The paper underscores considering partner preferences and abilities 
      when choosing evaluation methods for patient-partnered research.

TI  - Patient and public involvement in international research: Perspectives of a team 
      of researchers from six countries on collaborating with people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and end-of-life.
PG  - e13942

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient and public involvement (PPI) is a critical priority in 
      research, policy, academia and advocacy organizations. PPI in dementia research 
      is gaining momentum. However, these efforts are missing in international projects 
      aimed at those living with advanced dementia in long-term care (LTC) homes. 
      Additional complexities can arise in enacting PPI within the context of 
      integration of a palliative approach to care and experiences around end-of-life 
      in (EOL) dementia. The mySupport study involved implementing the Family Carer 
      Decision Support (FCDS) intervention for care partners of those living with 
      advanced dementia in LTC in six countries. RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVE: An 
      interpretive description study was conducted to explore the perspectives of 
      international researchers from six countries on engaging people with lived 
      experiences of dementia and EOL care in research processes. The findings from 
      this study informed the development of a PPI strategy and a subsequent toolkit 
      for the FCDS intervention. FINDINGS: Thirty-eight interviews were completed with 
      project researchers: 12 from the United Kingdom, 8 from Canada, 7 from Ireland, 4 
      each from Italy and The Netherlands and 3 from the Czech Republic. Four broad 
      themes describe international researchers' perspectives on advancing methods of 
      engagement for people with lived experiences of dementia and EOL in international 
      PPI activities: (1) Groundwork to engage in research; (2) planning for research 
      activities is key; (3) focus on meaningful engagement and (4) having foresight 
      for practical issues shaping PPI. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: International 
      projects that involve PPI can present many sources of challenges. The findings in 
      this study highlight important considerations for foundational work for 
      incorporating PPI in international projects. Learning from world leaders and 
      those with lived experiences in various regions can be insightful and help share 
      tools and resources. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: PPI was envisioned as a 
      critical part of conducting the mySupport study. The findings from this study 
      informed the development of a PPI strategy and an international Strategic Guiding 
      Council that included family carers of those living with advanced dementia in LTC 
      homes in six countries. This manuscript focused on the perspectives of 
      researchers on their engagement with people with lived experiences of dementia 
      and EOL. The perspectives of persons with lived experiences on engaging in the 
      mySupport research study will be reported in a forthcoming manuscript.

TI  - Patient partner perspectives on compensation: Insights from the Canadian Patient 
      Partner Survey.
PG  - e13971
LID - 10.1111/hex.13971 [doi]
LID - e13971
AB  - INTRODUCTION: There is a growing role for patients, family members and caregivers 
      as consultants, collaborators and partners in health system settings in Canada. 
      However, compensation for this role is not systematized. When offered, it varies 
      in both type (e.g., one-time honorarium, salary) and amount. Further, broad-based 
      views of patient partners on compensation are still unknown. We aimed to describe 
      the types and frequency of compensation patient partners have been offered and 
      their attitudes towards compensation. METHODS: This study uses data from the 
      Canadian Patient Partner Study (CPPS) survey. The survey gathered the experiences 
      and perspectives of those who self-identified as patient partners working across 
      the Canadian health system. Three questions were about compensation, asking what 
      types of compensation participants had been offered, if they had ever refused 
      compensation, and whether they felt adequately compensated. The latter two 
      questions included open-text comments in addition to menu-based and scaled 
      response options. Basic frequencies were performed for all questions and 
      open-text comments were analyzed through inductive qualitative content analysis. 
      RESULTS: A total of 603 individuals participated in the CPPS survey. Most 
      respondents were never or rarely offered salary (81%), honorarium (64%), gift 
      cards (80%) or material gifts (93%) while half were offered conference 
      registration and expenses at least sometimes. A total of 129 (26%) of 499 
      respondents reported refusing compensation. Of 511 respondents, half felt 
      adequately compensated always or often, and half only sometimes, rarely or never. 
      Open-text comments revealed positive, ambivalent and negative attitudes towards 
      compensation. Attitudes were framed by perceptions about their role, sentiments 
      of giving back to the health system, feelings of acknowledgement, practical 
      considerations, values of fairness and equity and accountability relationships. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm that compensation is not standardized in 
      Canada. Half of survey respondents routinely feel inadequately compensated. 
      Patient partners have diverse views of what constitutes adequate compensation 
      inclusive of personal considerations such as a preference for volunteering, and 
      broader concerns such as promoting equity in patient partnership. Organizations 
      should attempt to ensure that compensation practices are clear, transparent and 
      attentive to patient partners' unique contexts. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Two patient 
      partners are members of the CPPS research team and have been fully engaged in all 
      study phases from project conception to knowledge translation. They are

TI  - Public Engagement in Health Policy-Making for Older Adults: A Systematic Search 
      and Scoping Review.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As the world's population ages, there has been increasing attention 
      to developing health policies to support older adults. Engaging older adults in 
      policy-making is one way to ensure that policy decisions align with their needs 
      and priorities. However, ageist stereotypes often underestimate older adults' 
      ability to participate in such initiatives. This scoping review aims to describe 
      the characteristics and impacts of public engagement initiatives designed to help 
      inform health policy-making for older adults. METHODS: A systematic search of 
      peer-reviewed and grey literature (English only) describing public engagement 
      initiatives in health policy-making for older adults was conducted using six 
      electronic databases, Google and the Participedia website. No geographical, 
      methodological or time restrictions were applied to the search. Eligibility 
      criteria were purposefully broad to capture a wide array of relevant engagement 
      initiatives. The outcomes of interest included participants, engagement methods 
      and reported impacts. RESULTS: This review included 38 papers. The majority of 
      public engagement initiatives were funded or initiated by governments or 
      government agencies as a formal activity to address policy issues, compared to 
      initiatives without a clear link to a specific policy-making process (e.g., 
      research projects). While most initiatives engaged older adults as target 
      participants, there was limited reporting on efforts to achieve participant 
      diversity. Consultation-type engagement activities were most prevalent, compared 
      to deliberative and collaborative approaches. Impacts of public engagement were 
      frequently reported without formal evaluations. Notably, a few articles reported 
      negative impacts of such initiatives. CONCLUSION: This review describes how 
      public engagement practices have been conducted to help inform health 
      policy-making for older adults and the documented impacts. The findings can 
      assist policymakers, government staff, researchers and seniors' advocates in 
      supporting the design and execution of public engagement initiatives in this 
      policy sector. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: Older adult partners from the 
      McMaster University Collaborative for Health and Aging provided strategic advice 
      throughout the key phases of this review, including developing a review protocol, 
      data charting and synthesis and interpreting and presenting the review findings. 
      This collaborative partnership was an essential aspect of this review, enhancing 
      its relevance and meaningfulness for older adults.

AB  - Trauma leads to mental health problems including posttraumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. New treatments are needed for traumatic stress 
      that can overcome barriers to care while targeting underlying biological 
      mechanisms of the pathology. Morning light treatment has potential as a novel 
      intervention for traumatic stress. We conducted a randomized clinical trial 
      testing 3 doses of a 4-week morning light treatment in people with traumatic 
      stress to evaluate brain mechanisms underlying the treatment. Forty-six 
      participants completed a baseline week followed by a 4-week morning light 
      treatment (15, 30 or 60 mins each morning). Functional magnetic resonance imaging 
      was conducted at pre- and post-treatment using an emotional faces task to probe 
      the amygdala, based on prior work showing direct effects of light on the amygdala 
      and the role of amygdala in traumatic stress. Clinician-rated symptoms and 
      self-reported symptoms were also assessed at pre- and post-treatment. No group 
      differences were observed in left amygdala reactivity, but right amygdala 
      reactivity reduced only in the 30 and 60 min groups with medium effect sizes. 
      Clinical symptoms reduced in all groups with medium to large effect sizes. 
      Self-reported depression and anxiety scores reduced more in the 60 min than in 
      the 15 min group (p = .02). The results suggest that 4 weeks of morning light 
      treatment of at least 30 min per day can reduce amygdala reactivity and symptoms 
      of traumatic stress. Morning light treatment should be further explored as a 
      potential treatment for traumatic stress, given it is relatively safe, 
      acceptable, accessible and scalable.

AB  - ObjectiveScreening for lung cancer with low dose computed tomography aims to 
      reduce lung cancer mortality, but there is a lack of knowledge about how target 
      populations consider its potential benefits and harms.MethodsWe conducted a 
      systematic review of primary empirical studies published in any jurisdiction 
      since 2002 using an integrative meta-synthesis technique. We searched six health 
      and social science databases. Two reviewers independently screened titles, 
      abstracts, and potentially eligible full-text studies. Quantitative assessments 
      and open-ended perspectives on benefits and harms were extracted and convergently 
      integrated at analysis using a narrative approach. Study quality was 
      assessed.ResultsThe review included 26 quantitative, 18 qualitative, and 5 mixed 
      methods studies. Study quality was acceptable. Lung cancer screening was widely 
      perceived to be personally beneficial for early detection and reassurance. 
      Radiation exposure and screening accuracy were recognised as harms, but these 
      were frequently considered to be justified by early detection of lung cancer. 
      Stigma, anxiety, and fear related to screening procedures and results were 
      pervasive among current smokers. People with low incomes reported not 
      participating in screening because of potential out-of-pocket costs and 
      geographic access.ConclusionsPopulations targeted for lung cancer screening 
      tended to consider screening as personally beneficial and rationalised physical, 
      but not psychological, harms. Screening programmes should be clear about 
      benefits, use non-stigmatising design, and consider equity as a guiding 
      principle.

AB  - Canada has a rich history of public engagement in the health policy sector. 
      However, current political, economic and social challenges call for critical 
      reflection on this history, to assess whether current approaches to engaging 
      Canadian publics are up to the task, and what adaptations or new approaches might 
      be needed. If the persisting inequities in health systems across Canada are going 
      to be addressed, it is imperative that those designing, developing and 
      implementing policies find ways to reflect the needs and preferences of the 
      communities and populations most adversely affected by these inequities in their 
      decisions. The purpose of this special issue is to address this important topic 
      through a series of research papers and commentaries. Our work is targeted to 
      health policy makers across Canada who are seeking to engage with various publics 
      on a wide array of health policy issues. We offer key insights into what more 
      purposeful and equitable public engagement might look like, as well as common 
      pitfalls in public engagement practices and how they can be avoided.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Canada has a rich history of public engagement in health policy; 
      however, shifts in engagement practices over time have not been critically 
      examined. METHODOLOGY: We searched for cases of government-initiated public 
      engagement in Canadian health policy from 2000 to 2021 at the federal, provincial 
      (Ontario, British Columbia, Nova Scotia) and pan-Canadian levels. Government 
      databases, portals and platforms for engagement were searched, followed by 
      academic and grey literature using relevant search terms. A coding scheme was 
      iteratively developed to categorize cases by target population, recruitment 
      method and type of engagement. RESULTS: We identified 132 cases of 
      government-initiated public engagement. We found a predominance of feedback and 
      consultation engagement types and self-selection recruitment, especially at the 
      federal level from 2016 onward. Engagements that targeted multiple populations 
      (patients, public and other stakeholders) were favoured overall and over time. 
      Just over 10% of cases in our survey mentioned efforts to engage with 
      equity-deserving groups. CONCLUSION: Overall, our results identify a heavy 
      reliance over time on more passive, indirect engagement approaches, which limit 
      opportunities for collaborative problem solving and fail to include 
      equity-deserving populations. Those overseeing the design and implementation of 
      government-initiated public engagement will draw valuable lessons from this 
      review to inform the design of engagement initatives.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Public engagement in long-term care policy making in Canada has 
      primarily focused on "intermediary agents" who speak on behalf of long-term care 
      (LTC) residents and their family caregivers. Yet the legitimacy of these 
      intermediaries, as perceived by those they represent, has gone largely 
      unexplored. This study examines LTC resident and family perspectives on who can 
      legitimately represent them in LTC policy making. METHODOLOGY: We used an 
      interpretive description design, drawing on semi-structured interviews with LTC 
      residents and family caregivers in Ontario, Canada. Data were analyzed using 
      inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Eighteen interviews were conducted with 19 
      participants. Three key characteristics of legitimate representatives were 
      identified: (1) willingness to act in the best interests of residents and 
      families, (2) having the necessary skills and capacity to participate in LTC 
      policy making and (3) engaging directly with residents and families. CONCLUSION: 
      Governments and civil society organizations seeking to establish and maintain 
      legitimacy in the eyes of LTC residents and family members can pursue this goal 
      by supporting intermediaries who mirror the identities or experiences of those 
      they represent, who are dedicated to serving their interests and who routinely 
      and directly engage with them to understand the realities of LTC.

AB  - Almost 50,000 people in Canada have had a medically assisted death since federal 
      legislation was passed in 2016. Still, the debate about the permissibility of 
      medical assistance in dying (MAiD) continues to rage. The central role of shared 
      values and ethics in public policy making emphasizes the importance of engaging 
      the public, particularly around heavily value-laden issues such as MAiD. Public 
      deliberation, a mode of engagement that fosters sustained and reasoned discussion 
      between participants, is well-suited to addressing such ethically contentious 
      policy issues. In this paper, we review recent efforts to engage the public on 
      assisted dying within and outside Canada and explain how public deliberation 
      could contribute substantively to MAiD policy making.

TI  - Building Engagement-Capable Environments for Health System Transformation: 
      Development and Early Implementation of a Capability Framework for Patient, 
      Family and Caregiver Engagement in Ontario Health Teams.
PG  - e70083
LID - 10.1111/hex.70083 [doi]
LID - e70083
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite widespread calls to involve patients, families and 
      caregivers (PFCs) as partners at all levels of health system planning and design, 
      there is unevenness in how engagement efforts are supported across these 
      settings. The concept of 'engagement-capable environments' offers a way forward 
      to uncover the key requirements for sustainable, high-quality engagement, but 
      more work is needed to identify the specific competencies required to create 
      these environments. We addressed this gap by developing a capability framework 
      for Ontario Health Teams (OHTs), a newly established structure for planning, 
      designing, organizing and delivering care in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: The 
      framework was co-developed by a Working Group of OHT staff and leaders, PFC 
      partners, researchers and government personnel. Project activities occurred over 
      four phases: (1) planning, (2) evidence review and surveying of intended users to 
      identify key competencies, (3) framework design and (4) implementation. RESULTS: 
      An evidence review identified more than 90 potential competencies for this work. 
      These results were contextualized and expanded through a survey of OHT 
      stakeholders to brainstorm potential competencies, supports and enablers for 
      engagement. Surveys were completed by 69 individuals; 689 knowledge and skill 
      competency statements, 462 attitude and behaviour competency statements and 250 
      supports and enablers were brainstormed. The statements were analysed and 
      organized into initial competency categories, which were reviewed, discussed and 
      iteratively refined by Working Group members and through broader consultations 
      with the OHT community. The final framework includes six competency domains and 
      four support and enabler domains, each with sub-domain elements, mapped across a 
      three-stage maturity model. The framework has been disseminated across OHTs, and 
      its adoption and implementation are now requirements within OHT agreements. 
      CONCLUSION: The framework combines a strong conceptual foundation with actionable 
      elements informed by the literature and consultations with the intended users of 
      the framework. Although developed for OHTs, the framework should be broadly 
      applicable to other health system organizations seeking similar health system 
      transformation goals. PATIENT CONTRIBUTION: Patient, family and caregiver 
      partners were involved at all stages and in all aspects of the work. As end users 
      of the framework, their perspectives, knowledge and opinions were critical.

      Informant Qualitative Description Study.
PG  - 139-153
LID - 10.1093/phe/phae008 [doi]
AB  - Normative issues associated with the design and implementation of 
      population-based lung cancer screening policies are underexamined. This study was 
      an exposition of the ethical justification for screening and potential ethical 
      issues and their solutions in Canadian jurisdictions. A qualitative description 
      study was conducted. Key informants, defined as policymakers, scientists and 
      clinicians who develop and implement lung cancer screening policies in Canada, 
      were purposively sampled and interviewed using a semi-structured guide informed 
      by population-based disease screening principles and ethical issues in cancer 
      screening. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. 
      Fifteen key informants from seven provinces were interviewed. Virtually all 
      justified screening by beneficence, describing that population benefits outweigh 
      individual harms if high-risk people are screened in organized programs according 
      to disease screening principles. Equity of screening access, stigma and lung 
      cancer primary prevention were other ethical issues identified. Key informants 
      prioritized beneficence over concerns for group-level justice issues when making 
      decisions about whether to implement screening policies. This prioritization, 
      though slight, may impede the implementation of screening policies in a way that 
      effectively addresses justice issues, a goal likely to require justice theory and 
      critical interpretation of disease screening principles.

AB  - Amid growing evidence and high-profile incidents highlighting the dangers of 
      current police practices, many are questioning the role of armed police in their 
      communities. Police violence is a public health issue and unarmed nonpolice 
      response programs represent one potential solution for addressing this issue. In 
      this article, we describe local visions and key tension points for an unarmed 
      public safety program to reduce police violence and improve the health and 
      well-being of its residents. We report on interviews (n = 15) conducted with 
      local leaders, activists, and social service providers in a small-sized 
      Midwestern city that had allocated funding to pilot an unarmed response program. 
      To supplement the interviews, we also systematically followed local news stories 
      and city council meetings and participated as members of a coalition working 
      toward implementing an unarmed response program. Our analysis focused on 
      participants' visions and expectations for an unarmed safety program and 
      identified several key concerns related to program logistics, including program 
      reach, response time, funding, impact, and staffing. We found that key concerns 
      raised by activists and leaders-including the scope of the program, the 
      satisfaction the community has with the program, how it will be evaluated, and 
      how community members will be involved-are similar to concerns raised in a 
      typical health promotion program planning process. The visions and tensions 
      detailed in this article can inform organizing efforts in other municipalities 
      and suggest a role for public health practitioners in developing and implementing 
      these programs.

TI  - Change Is Hardest Right Before the Glass Ceiling Breaks: An Update on Women 
      Pursuing Careers in Academic Surgery at a National Level.
PG  - 176-183
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000006718 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to provide a comprehensive update on the 
      representation of women in academic surgery by specialty, measuring progress and 
      opportunity with regard to women "breaking" the glass ceiling at the trainee, 
      faculty, and department chair levels. BACKGROUND: Over the past 2 decades, 
      initiatives have contributed to educational awareness, culture shifts, and a 
      focus on inclusive excellence in surgery, leading to an increase in the number of 
      women surgeons. Despite progress, a persistent gender gap in surgical faculty 
      positions remains, and projections suggest that it will take more than a century 
      to reach parity at the highest levels of academic surgery. METHODS: Data from the 
      Association of American Medical Colleges' FACTS and Faculty Rosters and the 
      American Medical Colleges' Graduate Medical Education reports from 2006 to 2023 
      were analyzed to assess gender representation in surgery. Linear regression 
      analyses were used to describe trends in the proportions of women who were 
      promoted along the professional development pathway (resident to faculty to 
      department chair) from 2006 to 2023. RESULTS: Over our 17-year study period, all 
      included surgical subspecialties increased in the proportion of women trainees, 
      with the largest average annual increases observed in pediatric, plastic, and 
      vascular surgery training programs. Although all surgical faculty levels 
      experienced growth in the proportion of women faculty﻿, the average annual change 
      in the proportion of women decreased as seniority increased. At the observed 
      trend, it is projected that surgical department chairs will not achieve equal 
      proportions of men and women until the year 2102. CONCLUSIONS: Across the board, 
      the proportion of women in surgery has increased. However, there remains 
      opportunity for improvement, particularly at the senior faculty and department 
      chair levels.

TI  - Feasibility and acceptability of written exposure therapy group in a virtual 
      outpatient setting.
LID - 10.1002/jts.23175 [doi]
AB  - Written exposure therapy (WET) has emerged as a promising treatment for 
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with the potential to overcome common 
      barriers to engagement. Several facets of WET lend themselves particularly well 
      for adaptation to a group setting, yet few studies have examined WET in such 
      formats. The objective of the present study was to present preliminary 
      feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome data from a quality improvement 
      project conducted in an outpatient psychiatry clinic that included patients who 
      engaged in a virtual WET group. Participants were 28 adults from six WET group 
      cohorts that occurred between January 2024 and March 2025. Overall attendance was 
      strong (78.2%), with 67.9% of participants completing at least five of the six 
      weekly sessions. Patient satisfaction ratings were high (80.0%), and 86.7% of 
      participants indicated that they would recommend the group to other individuals 
      struggling with trauma symptoms. Acceptability ratings were also largely 
      supportive of the virtual (vs. in-person) and group (vs. individual) formats. 
      There were large effect sizes for pre-post improvement in PTSD symptoms (PCL-5: M 
      = 52.6 vs. 33.0), d = 1.39, and depressive symptoms (PHQ-9: M = 14.2 vs. 9.9), d 
      = 0.86, among participants who completed the group. Our study provides 
      preliminary data suggesting the feasibility and acceptability of a virtual WET 
      group delivered in a naturalistic community setting, with strong attendance and 
      high patient satisfaction. There is significant benefit to standardizing a 
      group-based WET protocol and substantiating clinical benefits through a fully 
      powered randomized controlled clinical trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We describe a Patient Engagement Day from the Canadian Stroke 
      Prevention Network (C-SPIN). Patients and family members were engaged as patient 
      partners to generate and prioritize future direction for Atrial Fibrillation (AF) 
      research. METHODS: A facilitated group discussion methodology was used that 
      included a nominal group brainstorming and decision-making technique designed to 
      foster participation and idea generation. RESULTS: Twenty-four patient partners 
      attended. Priorities related to: 1) need for a curative focus and not new 
      medication (84 %), 2) identification of triggers (53 %), and 3) home-based/remote 
      monitoring (53 %). Use of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool 
      (PPEET) found patient partners understood the intent of the day, with its 
      objectives being met. Findings highlighted knowledge gaps by patient partners 
      that were previously thought to be understood. CONCLUSION: Patient partners could 
      benefit from more focused education about atrial fibrillation. Notably, the 
      priorities identified by patient partners were new to the research team, 
      reinforcing the importance of engaging with the population who will be impacted 
      by the research. INNOVATION: Little research has been undertaken examining 
      patient partner priorities regarding atrial fibrillation research. This work 
      highlights patient partners' interest in providing input and shaping future 
      research endeavors.
