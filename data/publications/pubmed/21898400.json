  "abstract": "MicroRNA 520c and 373 (miR-520c and miR-373) have been characterized as oncogenes and play critical roles in cancer cell metastasis. However, the relationship between these two microRNAs and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are important in cancer cell metastasis, remains unknown. Here, we report new evidence in which miR-520c and miR-373 effects in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells are associated with MMP9 activity, and this upregulation of MMP9 is not only at the activity and protein levels, but also at that of its mRNA. Our experimental data demonstrate that these effects occur not by direct binding to the MMP9 promoter, but by miR-520c and miR-373 directly targeting the 3'-untranslational region (UTR) of mRNAs of mTOR and SIRT1 (negative regulators of expression of MMP9 via inactivating the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway and transcription factor NF-κB activity); and thus suppressing translation levels of SIRT1 and mTOR. Moreover, inhibition of key kinases of the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway and Western blots for selected proteins further identified miR-520c and miR-373 as activating this signaling pathway and NF-κB. In conclusion, miR-520c and miR-373 increased the expression of MMP9 by directly targeting the 3'-UTRs of mRNAs of mTOR and SIRT1 and suppressing their translation; resulting in activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk signaling pathway and NF-κB; and, finally, increasing the mRNA, protein, and activity of MMP9 and enhancing cell migration and cell growth in 3D type I collagen gels.",
