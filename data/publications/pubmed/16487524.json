  "abstract": "Randomised trials top the hierarchy of evidence. To provide the best evidence to guide surgical practice, randomised trials must answer clinically important questions, have important and objective outcome measurement and be sufficiently powered to detect important differences between interventions. Investigators who adhere to these principles are more likely to succeed during the conduct of their trials.",
