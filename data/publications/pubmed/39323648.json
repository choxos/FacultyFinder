  "title": "Use of arterial transposition for vascular reconstruction within contaminated or infected abdominal fields.",
  "abstract": "Intra-abdominal arterial reconstructions in the setting of reoperative, contaminated, or frankly infected fields can be a challenging undertaking for even the most experienced vascular surgeons. Open surgical arterial transpositions have been less commonly performed than other methods of reconstruction in the current era of vascular surgery despite many historical reports of successful outcomes. Autologous artery transpositions represent a viable option in the case of an infected or a contaminated operative field. We have described the cases of three patients treated at our institution who had required intra-abdominal revascularization in a contaminated or frankly infected surgical field. All three patients were successfully treated using open native visceral artery transposition procedures. These cases presented multiple challenges secondary to the ongoing infections, infected operative field, and, sometimes, a history of multiple vascular bypasses involving the aorta and visceral arteries. In such circumstances, we have demonstrated the effectiveness of native visceral arterial transposition as a feasible technique.",
