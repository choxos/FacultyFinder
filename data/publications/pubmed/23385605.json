  "title": "[Polish guidelines for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism. 2012 update].",
  "abstract": "The overall objective of the Polish guidelines for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism is to increase patient benefit and safety by appropriate prevention and treatment of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism as well as proper management of the complications associated with antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy. These guidelines apply to adult trauma, cancer, surgical, and medical patients as well as those at increased risk of venous thromboembolism. Specific recommendations have been formulated for pregnant women, patients requiring surgery while receiving long-term oral anticoagulant treatment, and patients undergoing regional anesthesia and/or analgesia. We chose to update the existing Polish guidelines with the use of the most recent high-quality international guidelines that we identified and adjusted the final product to Polish cultural and organizational setting. We based our recommendations primarily on the 9th edition of the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines on Antithrombotic Therapy and Prevention of Thrombosis, the European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on the Diagnosis and Management of Acute Pulmonary Embolism, the 3rd edition of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine Evidence-Based Guidelines on Regional Anesthesia in the Patient Receiving Antithrombotic or Thrombolytic Therapy, the ACOG practice bulletin on thromboembolism in pregnancy (Number 123), and Guidance from the Scientific and Standardisation Committee of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis on the Duration of Anticoagulant Therapy after a First Episode of Unprovoked Pulmonary Embolus or Deep Vein Thrombosis, as well as two other Polish practice guidelines on the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and the management of patients treated with oral direct inhibitors of factor X or factor II. To make recommendations regarding specific management issues that had not been addressed in other guidelines, or whenever the panel members felt they needed additional information to reach the decision, we also consulted the authors of guidelines developed by other professional societies and organizations as well as additional sources of evidence. For each adapted recommendation, we explicitly assessed its relevance and applicability in the context of the healthcare system in Poland. When necessary, we explicitly stated the rationale for modification of the previously published recommendations and judgements about the values and preferences we assumed. The information regarding reimbursement of drugs mentioned in the recommendations was added in chapters 6-9 and 13 and approved by the National Health Fund. The final version of the practice guidelines was officially approved by the scientific societies and institutions listed at the beginning of the document.",
