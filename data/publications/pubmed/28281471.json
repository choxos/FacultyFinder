  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is one of the most widely performed bariatric surgeries in the world. Performing an RYGB by a Da Vinci Surgical System is a new advancement. The aim of this study is to describe single docking-single quadrant technique and its short-term results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2013 and December 2013, 140 robotic RYGB were performed. The RYGB was performed through single docking, single quadrant approach. The data were analysed retrospectively. Intra- and post-operative details of every patient were documented. Follow-up was done as per protocol at 6 months; 1 and 2 years. In total, 120 patients completed the follow-up protocol as per our database. RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 42.7 ± 12.11 years. Ratio of males: females were equal. The mean operative time was 97.48 ± 23.79 min. Early mortality was seen 7 days post-surgery. Two late complications were documented with no late mortality. The average length of stay was 2.89 ± 1.06 days. Average blood loss was 55.79 ± 11.91 ml. There was no hospital re-admission after the surgery. CONCLUSION: Single docking-single quadrant technique is simple, effective and time saving without having complicated port position, multiple docking with minimal complications.",
