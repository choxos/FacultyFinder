  "title": "The Effectiveness of Indigenous Knowledge-Based Lifestyle Interventions in Preventing Obesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Indigenous Children in Canada: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Indigenous children in Canada have high rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Culturally appropriate interventions, guided by an Indigenous knowledge-based view of health, are crucial to target these conditions. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the impact of indigenous Knowledge-based lifestyle interventions on the prevention of obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada. METHODS: Database searches were conducted from inception until February 22, 2022. The main outcomes were changes in Body Mass Index (BMI) z-score and the development of T2DM. The other outcomes included adiposity, metabolic, and lifestyle determinants of health. The GRADE approach was used to assess confidence in the evidence. RESULTS: Four non-randomized controlled trials (non-RCTs) and six uncontrolled studies were identified. Peer-led interventions led to a reduction in BMI z-score and waist circumference. GRADE assessment revealed very low quality of evidence due to a lack of randomization and small sample sizes. There were no diabetes-specific reported programs. CONCLUSION: Limited evidence from non-randomized studies suggest that peer-led indigenous Knowledge-based lifestyle interventions improve BMI z-score and central adiposity. There is a need for community-owned and adequately powered randomized studies for interventions that aim to treat and prevent obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada.
