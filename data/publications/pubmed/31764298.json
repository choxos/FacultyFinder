  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recent advances in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities have made oncologic care ever more challenging, and multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs) are increasingly being used as a forum to discuss and coordinate care for complex oncology patients. Literature on the use of MTBs specific to cutaneous oncology and dermatologic surgery remains limited. OBJECTIVE: To share our experiences with cutaneous oncology MTBs at the University of Vermont Medical Center (UVMMC). METHODS: We describe the formation, timing, participation, clinical discussion, case follow-up, and coordination of care of our MTBs. RESULTS: A log of all cases discussed at cutaneous oncology MTBs from August 2018 to August 2019 is presented as an example. Five specific cases are described in further detail to demonstrate critical components of multidisciplinary care. CONCLUSION: The MTBs at UVMMC has created a collaborative environment for providers in multiple specialties to jointly formulate and coordinate optimal treatment plans for difficult cases, particularly when treatment guidelines do not exist or are insufficient. Furthermore, MTBs can serve as an educational forum for all participants.",
