  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This study aims to understand how osteoporosis medication acceptance varies across countries with differing guidance on treatment threshold and influence of clinical and demographic factors. A total of 79.2% accepted treatment at a fracture probability at or below the treatment threshold. Fracture history and age did not strongly impact acceptance, suggesting a need for improved fracture risk communication. PURPOSE: This part of the Improving Risk Communication in Osteoporosis (RICO) study aims to understand patients' willingness to initiate osteoporosis treatment given a hypothetical fracture probability-derived from the FRAX® Risk Assessment Tool-and how age, fracture history, and numeric literacy may influence this. METHODS: In 2022-2023, 332 postmenopausal women at risk of fracture were interviewed from nine countries to determine participants' Fracture Risk Decision Point (FRDP), the lowest probability of major osteoporotic fracture at which they would accept an osteoporosis medication. Participants' FRDP was evaluated given eight hypothetical 10-year FRAX scores. RESULTS: In countries with FRAX-based treatment thresholds, over half of the participants per country reported an FRDP that was below the threshold. Collectively, 79.2% demonstrated FRDPs at or below their respective threshold. Age and fracture history did not have a strong influence on FRDP; however, those who demonstrated higher levels of numeric literacy reported a significantly higher median FRDP (10%) compared to those who showed lower levels (5%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Most patients were willing to accept an osteoporosis medication prescription at a hypothetical FRAX probability that was even lower than that of their nationally recommended treatment threshold. Literacy scores had a significant influence on FRDP whereas age and fracture history did not.",
