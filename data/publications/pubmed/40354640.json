  "title": "Identifying Optimal Wearable Devices for Monitoring Mobility in Hospitalized Older Adults: Feasibility, Acceptability, and Validity Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hospitalized, frail older adults have an increased risk of developing hospital-acquired disability associated with hospital practices of restricted physical activity and immobilization. The use of activity tracking wearable devices may allow identification and prevention of mobility decline, reducing hospital-acquired disability. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the optimal wearable device and wear location for monitoring mobility in older hospitalized patients. Specific objectives included (1) comparison of the feasibility and acceptability of ActiGraph wGT3X-BT (ActiGraph LLC), MOX1 (Maastricht Instruments), MetaMotionC (mBientLab), and Fitbit Versa (Google) for continuous mobility monitoring and (2) determination of the concurrent validity of the selected device for detecting body posture and step count. METHODS: Participants were recruited for this observational study in the acute medical care unit of an academic hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Eligible patients were aged 60 years and older, able to undertake the mobility protocol, and had an anticipated length of stay greater than 4 days. The study was divided into 2 experiments. Experiment 1 evaluated the feasibility of 4 wearable devices and validated the derived data for body posture and step count. Experiment 2 involved a mobility assessment session and a 24-hour monitoring and feasibility period with the selected device from experiment 1. RESULTS: The ActiGraph wGT3X-BT emerged as the most feasible device, demonstrating superior usability, data acquisition, and management. The thigh-worn ActiGraph accurately detected sedentary behavior, while the ankle-worn device provided detailed information on step counts and body postures. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that the ankle-worn ActiGraph showed excellent reliability for step counting, with minimal bias and narrow limits of agreement. Patients expressed a high willingness to wear a continuous mobility tracking device at the hospital and at home. CONCLUSIONS: Thigh- and ankle-worn ActiGraph are optimal for assessing and monitoring mobility in older hospitalized patients. Challenges such as discomfort and device removal observed during the 24-hour monitoring period highlight areas for future studies. Overall, our findings support the integration of wearable technology in hospital settings to enhance mobility monitoring and early intervention strategies. Further research is warranted to evaluate the long-term use of wearable data for predicting health outcomes post hospitalization and informing clinical decision-making to promote early mobility.",
