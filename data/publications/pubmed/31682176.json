  "abstract": "Purpose: To compare the Cancer Distress Scales for Adolescents and Young Adults (CDS-AYA)-Emotional and Impact scales-with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale-revised (ESAS-r), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN-DT) for use as a patient-reported outcome-performance measure (PRO-PM) for AYA cancer care. Methods: Data were collected as part of the field test study of CDS-AYA. Assessment criteria were based on a National Quality Forum report. Internal and test-retest (TRT) reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficients, respectively. A content sort of items in each scale was performed to determine AYA-specific content. Two predefined hypotheses for gender and treatment status were assessed using t-test. Results: Four hundred twenty-one participants were included in the analyses. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.79 to 0.94, with only the two scales of CDS-AYA achieving >0.90. TRT reliability for HADS was considered excellent (>0.90), with remaining scales having moderate to good reliability (>0.70). Only the Impact scale of CDS-AYA had items that addressed the specific concerns of AYAs (e.g., romantic relationships). In all scales, active therapy patients had higher levels of distress than patients not receiving treatment (p â‰¤ 0.05). Distress was greater for females than males for all scales, but nonsignificant for both the ESAS-r (p = 0.07) and the HADS depression subscale (p = 0.13). The proportion of AYAs screening positive for distress varied by instrument. Conclusion: The Impact scale of CDS-AYA met the most criteria for selection of a PROM for use in performance measurement for the AYA cancer population.",
