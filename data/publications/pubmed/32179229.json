  "title": "Cadmium foliar application affects wheat Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn accumulation.",
  "abstract": "Cadmium is toxic to plants, easily reaching unsafe levels for animal and human consumption. A greenhouse experiment investigated the effect of foliar-applied Cd on the accumulation and distribution of Cd, Zn, Cu and Pb in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in heavy metal-contaminated soil. Cadmium solutions (0, 10, 20, 30 and 40 mg L[-1]) were repeatedly sprayed on entire aboveground wheat plants during heading stage to medium milk development stage. Plant sample analyses after harvest indicated that both the biomass yield and grain yield were negatively affected by Cd application (p < 0.05); compared to controls, leaf and grain Cd concentrations increased 187-547% and 26.3-91.8%, respectively. However, grain Cd accumulation (concentration Ã— yield) was not affected by Cd treatments (p > 0.05). Stem, leaf and glume Zn concentrations increased by less than 31%, while grain Zn concentrations were negatively affected by Cd treatments (3.4-34.4% lower than the control). Grain Cu concentrations were also negatively affected by Cd treatments, while grain Pb concentrations were similar between treatments. The antagonistic effect of Cd on grain Zn accumulation may mainly be due to competition for transporters and binding compounds in wheat leaves and stems. Preventing excess Cd from entering aboveground plant tissues should lessen negative plant and potentially animal/human health effects.",
