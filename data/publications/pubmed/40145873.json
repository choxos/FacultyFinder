  "title": "Trace Element Exposure during Pregnancy Has a Persistent Influence on Perinatal Gut Microbiota in Mother-Infant Dyads.",
  "abstract": "Trace elements have been recognized as the modifiers of the gut microbiota. However, population-based evidence about their effects on maternal gut microbiota dynamics, as well as the intergenerational impacts on neonatal gut microbiota, has been lacking. We examined the longitudinal microbiota data from mother-infant dyads and demonstrated that maternal trace element exposure played a pivotal role in shaping the composition and similarity of the mother-infant gut microbiota. Specifically, serum levels of cobalt (Co), molybdenum (Mo), and rubidium (Rb) were identified to cause further fluctuation in the shift of the maternal gut microbiota. Antibiotic usage shortly before or on the delivery day, as well as maternal zinc (Zn) exposure, affected the gut microbiota similarity within mother-infant dyads. Rb demonstrated an intergenerational effect on meconium Bifidobacterium abundance by altering its abundance in the maternal gut. Notably, this effect was strengthened in the vaginal delivery group without antibiotic usage, while it was attenuated in the c-section delivery group. Our results suggest that maternal trace element exposure has a persistent influence on perinatal gut microbiota, which offers novel insights into promoting mother and infant health.",
