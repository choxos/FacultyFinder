  "title": "Cannabis Hyperemesis Syndrome in a Young Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review.",
  "abstract": "Cannabis hyperemesis syndrome (CHS) is a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of severe vomiting, abdominal pain, and intractable nausea in chronic cannabis users. With the legalization of recreational marijuana in many states, awareness of CHS is crucial to prevent delayed diagnosis or misdiagnosis. This case report presents a 25-year-old male with a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and chronic cannabis use who presented to the emergency department with vomiting and epigastric pain. Our literature review sheds light on existing treatment options for this syndrome and gives future direction for research.",
