  "title": "The anterior and medial open approaches yield superior outcomes compared to the lateral and posterior open approaches in supracondylar humerus fractures in children: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to perform a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) to examine which open approach is superior in terms of outcomes and complications in the treatment of pediatric supracondylar humerus fractures. MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Clinicaltrials.gov , and Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to December 2022 and screened for relevant studies. Data were collected regarding patient demographics, Flynn's functional and cosmetic outcomes, and complications. Unsatisfactory Flynn's and complications were considered negative events. Comparisons of outcomes from aggregate data from each surgical approach using relative risk (RR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were performed. The NMA of overall negative events was conducted using a Bayesian hierarchical random-effects model analysis. A total of 26 studies involving 1461 patients were included; 459 (31.4%) patients underwent a closed reduction and percutaneous pinning (CRPP), 84 (5.7%) an anterior approach, 240 (16.4%) a medial, 220 (15%) a lateral, and 458 (31.3%) a posterior. The lateral and posterior approaches demonstrate a higher risk of negative event in the NMA compared to CRPP [RR = 2 (1.03, 3.85); RR = 2.63 (1.96, 3.57), respectively], anterior approach [RR = 3.33 (1.11, 10); RR = 4.35 (1.49, 12.5), respectively], and medial approach [RR = 1.82 (1.16, 2.86); RR = 2.38 (1.23, 4.76), respectively]. The medial approach resulted in a similar negative event rate compared to the anterior [RR = 1.82 (0.58, 5.88)]. The anterior and medial open approaches yield superior functional and cosmetic outcomes with fewer complications compared to the lateral and posterior.",
