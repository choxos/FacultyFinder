  "title": "Open ankle arthrodesis with a fibular-sparing technique.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Many ankle arthrodesis techniques excise the fibula or require a fibular osteotomy. Advantages of fibular preservation include increased surface area for bony union, preservation of the peroneal groove, prevention of valgus drift in cases of delayed union, and facilitation of future ankle arthroplasty. The goal of this study was to evaluate fusion rate and clinical outcomes of a novel open fibular-sparing ankle arthrodesis technique. METHODS: A total of 50 consecutive ankle arthrodeses using this technique were included in this study. These consisted of 46 patients with an average age of 52 (range, 30 to 71) years. Outcomes assessed postoperatively included radiographs, complications, patient satisfaction, and functional scoring. RESULTS: At an average of 28 (range, 19 to 56) months postoperatively, 38 patients (42 ankles) were available for review. Of the 42 cases, 39 (93%) achieved union at an average of 12 weeks postoperatively. Of patients, 86% reported being \"completely satisfied\" with the outcome. Average AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale was 84 ± 12 and average Foot Function Index pain subscale was 1 ± 0.9. Two ankles (5%) were fused in excessive varus; no patient required revision surgery for malalignment. CONCLUSION: This method of open ankle arthrodesis preserved the fibula and had a high fusion rate with good patient outcome scores.",
