  "title": "From carcinogenesis to therapeutic avenues: lncRNAs and mTOR crosstalk in lung cancer.",
  "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been demonstrated to have a crucial function in the modulation of the activity of genes, impacting a variety of homeostatic processes involving growth, survival, movement, and genomic consistency. Certain lncRNAs' aberrant expression has been linked to carcinogenesis, tumor growth, and therapeutic resistance. They are beneficial for the management of malignancies since they can function as cancer-causing or cancer-suppressing genes and behave as screening or prognosis indicators. The modulation of the tumor microenvironment, metabolic modification, and spread have all been linked to lncRNAs in lung cancer. Recent research has indicated that lncRNAs may interact with various mTOR signalling systems to control expression in lung cancer. Furthermore, the route can affect how lncRNAs are expressed. Emphasizing the function of lncRNAs as crucial participants in the mTOR pathway, the current review intends to examine the interactions between the mTOR cascade and the advancement of lung cancer. The article will shed light on the roles and processes of a few lncRNAs associated with the development of lung cancer, as well as their therapeutic prospects.",
