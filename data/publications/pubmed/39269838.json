  "title": "Clinical and Neuropathological Correlates of Substance Use in American Football Players.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy more frequently found in deceased former football players. CTE has heterogeneous clinical presentations with multifactorial causes. Previous literature has shown substance use (alcohol/drug) can contribute to Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies pathologically and clinically. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between substance use and clinical and neuropathological endpoints of CTE. METHODS: Our sample included 429 deceased male football players. CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed. Informant interviews assessed features of substance use and history of treatment for substance use to define indicators: history of substance use treatment (yes vs no, primary variable), alcohol severity, and drug severity. Outcomes included scales that were completed by informants to assess cognition (Cognitive Difficulties Scale, BRIEF-A Metacognition Index), mood (Geriatric Depression Scale-15), behavioral regulation (BRIEF-A Behavioral Regulation Index, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-11), functional ability (Functional Activities Questionnaire), as well as CTE status and cumulative p-tau burden. Regression models tested associations between substance use indicators and outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 429 football players (mean age = 62.07), 313 (73%) had autopsy confirmed CTE and 100 (23%) had substance use treatment history. Substance use treatment and alcohol/drug severity were associated with measures of behavioral regulation (FDR-p-values<0.05, ΔR2 = 0.04-0.18) and depression (FDR-p-values<0.05, ΔR2 = 0.02-0.05). Substance use indicators had minimal associations with cognitive scales, whereas p-tau burden was associated with all cognitive scales (p-values <0.05). Substance use treatment had no associations with neuropathological endpoints (FDR-p-values>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Among deceased football players, substance use was common and associated with clinical symptoms.",
