  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the genetic basis for a child with succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples of the proband and his parents were collected and subjected to Sanger sequencing. High-throughput sequencing was used to verify the gene variants. Bioinformatic software was used to analyze the pathogenicity of the variant sites. RESULTS: Sanger sequencing showed that the proband carried a homozygous c.1529C>T (p.S510F) variant of the ALDH5A1 gene, for which his mother was a carrier. The same variant was not detected in his father. However, high-throughput sequencing revealed that the child and his father both had a deletion of ALDH5A1 gene fragment (chr6: 24 403 265-24 566 986). CONCLUSION: The c.1529C>T variant of the ALDH5A1 gene and deletion of ALDH5A1 gene fragment probably underlay the disease in the child. High-throughput sequencing can detect site variation as well as deletion of gene fragment, which has enabled genetic diagnosis and counseling for the family.",
