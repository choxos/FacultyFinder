  "title": "Epidemiology and Impact of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction in Multiethnic Malaysia: An In-Depth Analysis of Local Data From the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Previous epidemiology studies from Malaysia on disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI) have utilized variable criteria. Furthermore, the impact of DGBI on quality of life (QoL), healthcare utilization, diet, work productivity, and sleep in a multiethnic Asian setting like Malaysia remains underexplored. Here, we aimed to determine the epidemiology and impact of DGBI among multiethnic Malaysians based on the Rome IV criteria. METHODS: 2072 Malaysian participants from the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study (RFGES) with complete data on DGBI were included in the in-depth analysis. We assessed the prevalence of DGBI diagnoses, psychological distress, QoL, healthcare utilization, dietary patterns, impact on sleep, work productivity, and activity impairment. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of any DGBI in Malaysia was 19.3% (95% CI 17.6%-21.0%). The top three most prevalent DGBI diagnoses were functional constipation (5.1%; 95% CI 4.2%-6.1%), functional dyspepsia (3.4%; 95% CI 2.7%-4.3%), and functional diarrhea (1.6%; 95% CI 1.1%-2.2%). Participants with DGBI reported higher levels of psychological distress (somatization, anxiety, and depression), significantly higher healthcare utilization, and dietary change (low FODMAPs but higher Mediterranean-based diet and probiotics). Furthermore, there was greater daytime sleepiness and higher proportions of presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment in individuals with DGBI. CONCLUSION: The disease burden of DGBI is significant in Malaysia, with increased psychological distress, healthcare utilization, dietary change, greater daytime sleepiness, and greater overall work and activity impairment.",
