  "title": "N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation in kidney diseases: Mechanisms and therapeutic potential.",
  "abstract": "The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is regulated by methylases, commonly referred to as \"writers,\" and demethylases, known as \"erasers,\" leading to a dynamic and reversible process. Changes in m6A levels have been implicated in a wide range of cellular processes, including nuclear RNA export, mRNA metabolism, protein translation, and RNA splicing, establishing a strong correlation with various diseases. Both physiologically and pathologically, m6A methylation plays a critical role in the initiation and progression of kidney disease. The methylation of m6A may also facilitate the early diagnosis and treatment of kidney diseases, according to accumulating research. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the potential role and mechanism of m6A methylation in kidney diseases, as well as its potential application in the treatment of such diseases. There will be a thorough examination of m6A methylation mechanisms, paying particular attention to the interplay between m6A writers, m6A erasers, and m6A readers. Furthermore, this paper will elucidate the interplay between various kidney diseases and m6A methylation, summarize the expression patterns of m6A in pathological kidney tissues, and discuss the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting m6A in the context of kidney diseases.",
