  "title": "Recent-year variations in O3 pollution with high-temperature suppression over central China.",
  "abstract": "By analyzing environmental and meteorological monitoring data over recent years of 2015-2022, the Twain-Hu Basin (THB) in central China was identified as a regional O3 pollution center over China with the highest increasing trend at 1.10 %⸱yr[-1] in interannual variations of O3 concentrations with deteriorating O3 pollution over recent years. We explored the spatiotemporal variations in O3 pollution in the THB with ozone suppression (OS) under high air temperature over metropolitan, small urban, and mountainous areas. The bipolarized interannual trends in interannual O3 variations in urban and mountainous areas over central China were characterized with the increasing and decreasing 90th percentiles of the daily maximum 8-h (MDA8-90) O3 concentrations respectively in polluted urban areas and clean mountainous areas over recent eight years. The changes of the near-surface O3 concentrations with air temperature exhibited the inflection points of OS from increasing to decreasing O3 at air temperature of 30.5 °C in mountainous areas, 32.5 °C in small urban areas, and 34.5 °C in metropolitan areas, and the intensity of OS was estimated in the ranking with mountainous areas (-2.30 μg⸱m[-3]⸱°C[-1]) > small urban areas (-1.96 μg⸱m[-3]⸱°C[-1]) > metropolitan areas (-1.54 μg⸱m[-3]⸱°C[-1]), indicating that the OS was more significant over the lower-O3 mountainous areas. This study has implications for understanding O3 pollution variations with the meteorological drivers.",
