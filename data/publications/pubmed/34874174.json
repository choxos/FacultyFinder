  "abstract": "Herein, we report the highly efficient total syntheses of galanthamine and lycoramine from a common tetracyclic intermediate. This concise synthetic route features a two-phase strategy, which includes the early-stage rapid construction of a tetracyclic skeleton followed by the late-stage selective reorganization of the tetracyclic skeleton. Key to the success of this strategy are a palladium-catalyzed carbonylative cascade annulation, a DDQ-mediated intramolecular regioselective oxidative lactamization, as well as a BF3Â·Et2O-promoted reorganization of the bridged tetracyclic skeleton.",
