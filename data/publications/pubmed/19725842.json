  "title": "Association of Bicuspid aortic valve morphology and aortic root dimensions: a substudy of the aortic stenosis progression observation measuring effects of rosuvastatin (ASTRONOMER) study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the leading cause of aortic stenosis in patients younger than the age of 50. A classification scheme of BAVs is based upon leaflet orientation: Type I (fusion of right and left coronary cusps) and Type II (fusion of right and noncoronary cusps). The correlation between BAV leaflet orientation and aortic root pathology however remains ill defined. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to describe a potential relationship between BAV leaflet morphology and aortic root measurements in the ASTRONOMER study, a multicenter study to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on the progression of AS. METHODS: BAV morphology was classified as Type I or Type II orientation based on the parasternal short-axis view. Echo measurements including left ventricular and aortic root dimensions were obtained. RESULTS: The study population included 89 patients (56 +/- 11 years; 44 males). There were 63 patients with Type I and 26 patients with Type II BAV. Baseline demographics, hemodynamics, and left heart dimensions were similar between both groups. Patients with Type I BAV had larger aortic annulus and ascending root dimensions compared to those patients with Type II BAV (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with mild to moderate aortic stenosis due to a BAV, the presence of Type I valve orientation was associated with significantly greater aortic root parameters compared to Type II valve orientation.",
