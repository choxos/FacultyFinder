  "title": "Sexual activity satisfaction in symptomatic hip osteoarthritis patients: A cross-sectional, national web-based study.",
  "abstract": "AIM: Despite high-interest rates in sex in people with hip osteoarthritis (OA), clinicians tend not to address sexual issues, especially in older adults. The objective of this study is to evaluate sexual activity and factors associated with sexual activity satisfaction in people with symptomatic hip OA. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 252 participants with symptomatic hip OA in Australia. Quality of sex life was assessed using the online composite of sexual activities and positions questionnaires. A Poisson model with robust variance was used to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR). Factors that showed a univariate association with sexual satisfaction were then included in a multivariable model. PR with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) are reported. RESULTS: Among the 282 participants registered on the study website, 252 met the inclusion criteria, and 60.3% (152/252) completed the sexual activity questionnaires. Hip OA interfered with sexual activity in 70.0% of the participants. High confidence in completing sexual activity (PR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.77) was associated with an increased prevalence ratio of sexual satisfaction. High anxiety, depression or stress during sexual activity (PR: 1.33, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.60) was associated with an increased prevalence ratio of sexual dissatisfaction after adjusting for hip pain level and perceived partner's orgasm. CONCLUSION: Although a large proportion of people with hip OA remain sexually active, a substantial proportion of persons are dissatisfied with their sexual activity. Hip OA interfered with sexual activity in most participants. Psychological factors were found to be associated with sexual activity satisfaction.",
