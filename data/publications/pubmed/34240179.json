  "title": "Paired Tumor-Normal Sequencing Provides Insights Into the TP53-Related Cancer Spectrum in Patients With Li-Fraumeni Syndrome.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Genetic testing for Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is performed by using blood specimens from patients selected based on phenotype-dependent guidelines. This approach is problematic for understanding the LFS clinical spectrum because patients with nonclassical presentations are missed, clonal hematopoiesis-related somatic blood alterations cannot be distinguished from germline variants, and unrelated tumors cannot be differentiated from those driven by germline TP53 defects. METHODS: To provide insights into the LFS-related cancer spectrum, we analyzed paired tumor-blood DNA sequencing results in 17â€‰922 patients with cancer and distinguished clonal hematopoiesis-related, mosaic, and germline TP53 variants. Loss of heterozygosity and TP53 mutational status were assessed in tumors, followed by immunohistochemistry for p53 expression on a subset to identify those lacking biallelic TP53 inactivation. RESULTS: Pathogenic/likely pathogenic TP53 variants were identified in 50 patients, 12 (24.0%) of which were clonal hematopoiesis related and 4 (8.0%) of which were mosaic. Twelve (35.3%) of 34 patients with germline TP53 variants did not meet LFS testing criteria. Loss of heterozygosity of germline TP53 variant was observed in 96.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 79.7% to 99.9%) of core LFS spectrum-type tumors vs 45.5% (95% CI = 16.8% to 76.6%) of other tumors and 91.3% (95% CI = 72.0% to 98.9%) of tumors from patients who met LFS testing criteria vs 61.5% (95% CI = 31.6% to 86.1%) of tumors from patients who did not. Tumors retaining the wild-type TP53 allele exhibited wild-type p53 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that some TP53 variants identified in blood-only sequencing are not germline and a substantial proportion of patients with LFS are missed based on current testing guidelines. Additionally, a subset of tumors from patients with LFS do not have biallelic TP53 inactivation and may represent cancers unrelated to their germline TP53 defect.",
