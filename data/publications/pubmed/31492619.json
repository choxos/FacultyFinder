  "title": "Reverse total shoulder arthroplasty in the younger patient (≤65 years): a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate outcomes of reverse total shoulder arthroplasty (RTSA) in patients aged ≤65 years. MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed were searched for relevant studies from database inception to September 18, 2018. All studies that evaluated RTSA in patients aged ≤65 years were included. Two independent reviewers screened all studies and performed a quality assessment. In the total of 6 studies reviewed, 245 participants underwent RTSA, with the most common indications being failed rotator cuff repair and rotator cuff tear arthropathy. Postoperative functional outcomes indicated a significant level of improvement across all reported outcomes at a mean follow-up of 49 months (range, 19-140 months) (P < .05). The pooled mean complication rate was 18% (n = 44/245), and this higher rate may be due to 36% of patients undergoing an RTSA for a failed arthroplasty procedure and the inclusion of older studies that lacked modern implants and techniques. Although there is a significant improvement in functional outcomes at midterm follow-up for RTSA in the patients aged ≤65 years, the pooled complication rates are high. However, the results of this systematic review are limited because of the heterogenous patient population undergoing surgery for various indications, including revision arthroplasty. Long-term studies and registry data are required using current modern techniques and implants to provide an accurate assessment of outcomes following RTSA in a young patient population.",
