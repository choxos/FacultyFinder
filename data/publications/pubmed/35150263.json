  "title": "Rhenium-guanidine complex as photosensitizer: trigger HeLa cell apoptosis through death receptor-mediated, mitochondria-mediated, and cell cycle arrest pathways.",
  "abstract": "The growing evidence over the past few decades has indicated that the photodynamic antitumor activity of transition metal complexes, and Re(I) compounds are potential candidates for photodynamic therapy. This study reports the synthesis, characterization, and anti-tumor activity of three new Re(I)-guadinium complexes. Cytotoxicity tests reveal that complex Re1 increased cytotoxicity by 145-fold from IC50 > 180 μM in the dark to 1.3 ± 0.7 μM following 10 min of light irradiation (425 nm) in HeLa cells. Further, the mechanism by which Re1 induces apoptosis in the presence or absence of light irradiation was investigated, and results indicate that cell death was caused through different pathways. Upon irradiation, Re1 first accumulates on the cell membrane and interacts with death receptors to activate the extrinsic death receptor-mediated signaling pathway, and then is transported into the cell cytoplasm. Most of the intracellular Re1 locates within mitochondria, improving the reactive oxygen species level, and decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP levels, and inducing the activation of caspase-9 and, thus, apoptosis. Subsequently, the residual Re1 can translocate into the cell nucleus, and activates the p53 pathway, causing cell cycle arrest and eventually cell death.",
