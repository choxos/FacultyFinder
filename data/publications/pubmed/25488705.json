  "title": "Position statement for the operator and institutional requirements for a transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) program.",
  "abstract": "The Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ) and the Australia and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) have joined together to provide recommendations for institutions and individual operators to assess their ability to initiate and maintain a transcatheter valve program. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been developed as an alternative to traditional surgical replacement of the aortic valve in high risk patients, particularly the frail elderly. The position paper has endorsed the important role of a multi-disciplinary \"Heart Team\" in selecting patients for TAVI as fundamental to the establishment of a successful program. The paper outlines recommendations for the cardiologist to have a background in structural intervention and the surgeon to have experience in high-risk aortic valve replacement. It is further recommended that TAVI programs be established in high volume cardiac surgical centres where on site valve surgery is performed. The paper is intended to provide guidance to individual operators and prospective institutions considering the establishment of a successful TAVI program.",
