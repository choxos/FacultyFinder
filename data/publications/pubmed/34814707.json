  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Task sharing in outpatient dementia care - Focus groups with GPs and nurses Abstract. Background: Caring for people with dementia (PWD) is challenging for the health system and family carers and can only be managed through interprofessional medical and nursing care. AIM: The AHeaD study investigated attitudes of general practitioners (GPs) and nurses towards the transfer of activities previously performed by GPs to advanced nurses in the outpatient care of PWDs. METHODS: In four focus group discussions with 10 GPs and 13 nurses, qualitative content analysis was used to investigate attitudes towards the transfer of certain tasks and to identify opportunities and barriers to their introduction. RESULTS: GPs primarily preferred the transfer of nursing activities such as blood sampling, assessments, their monitoring or follow-up prescriptions for nursing aids. \"Classical\" medical tasks (e. g. diagnosis of diseases, initial prescription of medication) are still seen in the hands of GPs. Nurses demanded more appreciation and recognition for the relationship between GPs and nurse and criticised the lack of trust and insufficient communication. Both sides pointed to tight time budgets that were hardly oriented towards the actual needs of the PWD. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a redistribution of tasks requires the creation of legal and financial framework conditions, time resources, concrete task descriptions as well as a stronger cooperation between the professional groups involved. Innovative concepts could contribute to the sensible use of the resources GP and nurses and strengthen the care of PWDs.",
