  "title": "The impact of preoperative imaging on wait times, surgical approach and overall survival in endometrioid endometrial cancers.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Routine preoperative axial imaging studies (CT/MRI) are not recommended for endometrioid endometrial cancer as they are unlikely to change management and may delay surgery. This study evaluated the association of receiving preoperative imaging on various outcomes. METHODS: A population-based cohort of Endometrioid Endometrial Cancer cases from 2006 to 2016 were identified from the Cancer Registry in Ontario, Canada. Wait time to surgery, type of surgery and overall survival were evaluated in patients with and without preoperative imaging. Predictive factors for wait time > 56 days and aggressive surgery (radical hysterectomy / lymphadenectomy) were determined using multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: 13,050 cases were included. 22.6% of patients received preoperative imaging, mainly CT scans. Most patients (95.9%) received no neoadjuvant treatment. Patients with preoperative imaging were more likely to have neoadjuvant treatment (11.7% vs. 1.8%) and less likely to have surgery at 180 days post diagnosis (87.9% vs 94.6%). Patients with preoperative imaging had median wait time to surgery of 64 days (47-87), compared to 53 days (36-74) than those without imaging (p < 0.001). Multivariable modeling showed preoperative imaging was associated with decreased odds of having surgery within 56 days (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.62-0.75), and increased odds (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.53-1.95) of having aggressive surgery. The 5-year overall survival for patients with imaging was 84.8% versus 91.1% for patients without preoperative imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative imaging was associated with longer wait times to surgery, more aggressive surgery, surgery with a gynecologic oncologist and increased use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. In early-stage disease there was no observed improvement in overall survival for patients with preoperative imaging. Further research on potential benefits of preoperative imaging in higher risk patients is required.",
