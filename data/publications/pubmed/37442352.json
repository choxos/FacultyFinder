  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, clinical characteristics and outcomes of type 2 myocardial infarction (T2AMI) in patients with versus without cancer. METHODS: All hospitalizations with a primary discharge diagnosis of T2AMI were stratified according to cancer status (secondary diagnosis of any-cancer vs cancer-free) using data from the US National Inpatient Sample (2016-2019). The primary outcome was in-hospital all-cause mortality while secondary outcomes were in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). RESULTS: Among 61,305 included hospitalizations with primary diagnosis of T2AMI, 3745 (6.1%) were associated with a diagnosis of cancer. Patients with T2AMI and cancer presented more frequently with acute respiratory failure (23.2% vs 18.1%), acute pulmonary embolism (3.7% v 1.3%), major bleeding (6.8% vs 4.1%) and renal failure (51.0% vs 46.8%), compared to patients without. On adjusted analysis, diagnosis of cancer was associated with lower odds of invasive coronary angiography (aOR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93, p = 0.009) but greater odds of mortality (aOR 1.95, 95% C.I. 1.26-2.99 p = 0.002). Among the different types of cancer, adjusted risk of all-cause mortality was higher in patients with colorectal (aOR 4.17 95% CI 1.68-10.32, p = 0.002), lung (aOR 3.63, 95% CI 1.83-7.18, p < 0.001) and haematologic (aOR 2.48, 95% CI 1.22-5.05, p = 0.001) cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer presenting with T2AMI have lower odds of management with invasive diagnostic coronary angiography and have higher rates of in-hospital all-cause death. Further studies are warranted to improve overall care and outcomes of cancer patients and cardiovascular diseases.",
