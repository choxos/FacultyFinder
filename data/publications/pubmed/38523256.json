  "title": "Evaluation of the European Society of Cardiology Risk Assessment Score in Incident Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) may be stratified as low, intermediate, or high risk of 1-year mortality. In 2022, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) updated and simplified its risk stratification tool, based on three variables: World Health Organization functional class, serum N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide and six-minute walk distance, applied at follow-up visits, intended to guide therapy over time. METHODS: We applied the 2022 ESC risk assessment tool at baseline and follow-up (within 2 years) to a multinational incident cohort of systemic sclerosis-associated PAH (SSc-PAH). Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox hazards regression, and accelerated failure time models were used to evaluate survival by risk score. RESULTS: At baseline (n = 260), the majority of SSc-PAH (72.2%) were graded as intermediate risk of death according to the 2022 tool. At follow-up, according to 2022 tool, half (55.5%) of the cohort were classified as low or intermediate-low risk. The 2022 risk model at follow-up was able to differentiate survival between risk strata. All three individual parameters (World Health Organization functional class, N-terminal pro-brain type natriuretic peptide, six-minute walk distance) were significantly associated with mortality at baseline and/or follow-up. CONCLUSION: The 2022 ESC risk assessment strategy applied at baseline and follow-up predicts survival in SSc-PAH. Treatment decisions for SSc-PAH should include risk assessments, aiming to achieve low-risk status according to the 2022 ESC guidelines.",
