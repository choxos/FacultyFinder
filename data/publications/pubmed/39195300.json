  "title": "HPV Self-Sampling for Cervical Cancer Screening in Under-Screened Saskatchewan Populations: A Pilot Study.",
  "abstract": "Of all cancers in female Canadians, the most rapidly increasing incidence is that of cervical cancer. The objective of this pilot study was to assess how HPV self-sampling might improve cervical cancer screening participation in both urban and rural settings in Saskatchewan, one of the most sparsely populated provinces in Canada. Study groups consisted of n = 250 participants to whom self-swabbing kits were mailed with instructions and n = 250 participants to whom kits were handed out in 6 urban and rural clinics. The inclusion criteria selected subjects aged 30-69 years who were Saskatchewan residents for at least 5 years with valid health coverage, had a cervix, and had no record of cervical cancer screening in 4 years. The returned samples were analyzed for specific HPV strains using the Roche Molecular Diagnostics Cobas 4800[Â®] System. The overall response rate was ~16%, with the response to the handout distribution being roughly double that of the mailout. While HPV positivity did not differ across the distribution groups, participants at a specific inner-city clinic reported significantly higher positivity to at least one HPV strain as compared to any other clinic and all mailouts combined. For this high-risk population, in-person handout of self-sampling kits may be the most effective means of improving screening.",
