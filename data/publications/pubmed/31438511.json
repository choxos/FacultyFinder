  "title": "Bacterial Inactivation on Concrete Plates Loaded with Modified TiO2 Photocatalysts under Visible Light Irradiation.",
  "abstract": "The antibacterial activity of concrete plates loaded with various titania photocatalysts was investigated. The target in bacteria testing was Escherichia coli K12. The presence of photocatalysts in the concrete matrix at a dose of 10 wt.% improved the antibacterial properties, which became significant depending on the type of the added photocatalyst. Total inactivation of E. coli irradiated under artificial solar light was observed on the concrete plates loaded with the following photocatalysts: TiO2/N,CMeOH-300, TiO2/N,CEtOH-100, TiO2/N,CisoPrOH-100 and TiO2/N-300. The modified Hom disinfection kinetic model was found as a best-fit model for the obtained results. The presence of nitrogen and carbon in the photocatalysts structure, as well as crystallite size, surface area and porosity, contributed to the increase of antibacterial properties of concrete plates.",
