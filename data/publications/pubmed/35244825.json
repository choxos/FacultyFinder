  "title": "Effectiveness of Tofacitinib for Hospitalized Patients with Acute Severe Ulcerative Colitis: Case Series.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Treatment options for acute severe ulcerative colitis (ASUC) are limited. Tofacitinib, an approved treatment for moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, could be a potential rescue therapy for ASUC given its rapid onset of action. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of tofacitinib in hospitalized patients with ASUC refractory to standard therapy in a real-world setting. METHODS: Retrospective observational study of hospitalized adult patients with ASUC treated with tofacitinib between January 2019 and September 2020 at five Canadian centers. We extracted patient demographics, clinical status, biomarkers (C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin), endoscopic findings, and colectomy-free rate at admission, 30 days, 90 days, and 6 months after tofacitinib initiation. RESULTS: Eight patients with symptoms refractory to standard rescue therapy (corticosteroids ± infliximab if infliximab-naïve prior to admission) were treated with tofacitinib. During index hospitalization, clinical response was observed in 5/8 patients. The median time to discharge post-tofacitinib initiation was 5 days (IQR 5.0-6). At 30 and 90 days, all five responders were in clinical remission. At 6 months, only 3/5 responders remained in clinical remission. The colectomy-free rate was 37.5% during the follow-up period (two colectomies occurred within 30 days; one occurred within 90 days). No drug-related adverse reaction occurred. CONCLUSION: In this small case-series, tofacitinib was an effective rescue therapy in patients with refractory ASUC. These findings need to be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.",
