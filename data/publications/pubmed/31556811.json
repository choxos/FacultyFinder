  "title": "Prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus Genotypes in Pakistan: Current Scenario and Review of Literature.",
  "abstract": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major public health concern globally, resulting in liver-related complications. Approximately 6% population of Pakistan is infected with HCV. HCV is error prone, due to which it is classified into 7 genotypes and 67 subtypes. HCV genotype determination is critical for treatment and therapy response. In this study, 3,539 samples were collected from 2015 to 2019 from all over Punjab. RNA was extracted from samples using QIA Amp Viral RNA MINI kit (Qiagen, Germany) and viral genotyping was performed. Furthermore, a systemized literature search (2009-2018) was done to analyze the HCV genotype distribution pattern in Pakistan. In Punjab, genotype 3a (86.46%) is most prevalent, followed by untypable (7.17%) and genotype 1a (3.84%) and 3b (1.04%). Mixed genotype constitutes only 0.67% of total infections. Genotype 2a, 2b, 3c, and 4 were found to be rare. Data available from literature review when compiled showed that HCV genotype 3a (58.16%) was predominant in Pakistan, followed by genotypes 3b (9.05%), 2a (6.70%), 1a (6.22%), and 1b (2.39%). The frequency of mixed genotypes was found to be 4% and 12% of untypable HCV variants. This study highlights the HCV genotype distribution pattern in different regions of Pakistan. Therapy response and disease management depend on genotype, so HCV genotype determination is crucial. In Pakistan, the most prevalent genotype is 3a, followed by untypable genotype. Both interferon and sofosbuvir are effective against genotype 3a, but treatment with sofosbuvir has comparatively high sustained virological response, less adverse effects, and more tolerability.",
