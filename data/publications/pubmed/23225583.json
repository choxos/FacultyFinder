  "abstract": "The potential of OCT applied to noninvasive blood glucose monitoring has attracted significant efforts. In this work we investigated the feasibility of OCT in monitoring blood glucose during oral intake of different sugars in humans. Five groups of experiments were performed, in which different sugars were used. The OCT signal slope (OCTSS) changed with variation of blood glucose concentration (BGC). A good correlation between OCTSS and BGC was observed in these experiments. The averaged correlation coefficients R between OCTSS and BGC are 0.900, 0.836, 0.895 and 0.884, corresponding to oral administration of glucose, fructose, sucrose and mixed sugar, respectively. Our studies demonstrated the capability and accuracy of the OCT system in monitoring BGC noninvasively and it could become a powerful tool in daily blood glucose monitoring for patients.",
