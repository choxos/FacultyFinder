  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial infection in patients with COVID-19 is low, however, empiric antibiotic use is high. Risk stratification may be needed to minimize unnecessary empiric antibiotic use. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors and microbiology associated with respiratory and bloodstream bacterial infection in patients with COVID-19. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, OVID Epub and EMBASE for published literature up to 5 February 2021. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies including at least 50 patients with COVID-19 in any healthcare setting. METHODS: We used a validated ten-item risk of bias tool for disease prevalence. The main outcome of interest was the proportion of COVID-19 patients with bloodstream and/or respiratory bacterial co-infection and secondary infection. We performed meta-regression to identify study population factors associated with bacterial infection including healthcare setting, age, comorbidities and COVID-19 medication. RESULTS: Out of 33 345 studies screened, 171 were included in the final analysis. Bacterial infection data were available from 171 262 patients. The prevalence of co-infection was 5.1% (95% CI 3.6-7.1%) and secondary infection was 13.1% (95% CI 9.8-17.2%). There was a higher odds of bacterial infection in studies with a higher proportion of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) (adjusted OR 18.8, 95% CI 6.5-54.8). Female sex was associated with a lower odds of secondary infection (adjusted OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55-0.97) but not co-infection (adjusted OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.80-1.37). The most common organisms isolated included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and Klebsiella species. CONCLUSIONS: While the odds of respiratory and bloodstream bacterial infection are low in patients with COVID-19, meta-regression revealed potential risk factors for infection, including ICU setting and mechanical ventilation. The risk for secondary infection is substantially greater than the risk for co-infection in patients with COVID-19. Understanding predictors of co-infection and secondary infection may help to support improved antibiotic stewardship in patients with COVID-19.",
