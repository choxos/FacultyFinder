  "abstract": "Short- and long-latency afferent inhibition (SAI and LAI respectively) are phenomenon whereby the motor evoked potential induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is inhibited by a sensory afferent volley consequent to nerve stimulation. It remains unclear whether dopamine participates in the genesis or modulation of SAI and LAI. The present study aimed to determine if SAI and LAI are modulated by levodopa (l-DOPA). In this placebo-controlled, double-anonymized study Apo-Levocarb (100 mg l-DOPA in combination with 25 mg carbidopa) and a placebo were administered to 32 adult males (mean age 24 Â± 3 years) in two separate sessions. SAI and LAI were evoked by stimulating the median nerve and delivering single-pulse TMS over the motor hotspot corresponding to the first dorsal interosseous muscle of the right hand. SAI and LAI were quantified before and 1 h following ingestion of drug or placebo corresponding to the peak plasma concentration of Apo-Levocarb. The results indicate that Apo-Levocarb increases SAI and does not significantly alter LAI. These findings support literature demonstrating increased SAI following exogenous dopamine administration in neurodegenerative disorders. KEY POINTS: Short- and long-latency afferent inhibition (SAI and LAI respectively) are measures of corticospinal excitability evoked using transcranial magnetic stimulation. SAI and LAI are reduced in conditions such as Parkinson's disease which suggests dopamine may be involved in the mechanism of afferent inhibition. 125 mg of Apo-Levocarb (100 mg dopamine) increases SAI but not LAI. This study increases our understanding of the pharmacological mechanism of SAI and LAI.",
