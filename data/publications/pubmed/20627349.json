  "title": "Computational analysis of adenovirus serotype 5 (HAdV-C5) from an HAdV coinfection shows genome stability after 45 years of circulation.",
  "abstract": "Adenovirus coinfections present opportunities for genome recombination. Computational analysis of an HAdV-C5 field strain genome, recovered from a patient with acute respiratory disease and coinfected with HAdV-B21, shows that there was no exchange of genomic material into HAdV-C5. Comparison of this genome to the sparsely amplified prototype demonstrates a high level of sequence conservation and stability of this genome across 45 years. Further, comparison to a version of the prototype that had been passaged in laboratory settings shows stability as well. HAdV genome stability and evolution are considerations for applications as vaccines and as vectors for gene delivery. In the annotation analysis, a single sequencing error in the HAdV-C5_ARM (Adenovirus Reference Material) genome is noted and may lead to erroneous annotation and biological interpretations.",
