  "title": "Extracorporeal shockwave therapy for chronic proximal plantar fasciitis.",
  "abstract": "Although much enthusiasm surrounds applying extracorporeal shock wave therapy for various musculoskeletal conditions, its effects are not well understood and warrant continued study. Certain body tissues or organs may be damaged either acutely or chronically by ESWT; however, it is unequivocal that lung tissue may be damaged. It is theorized that neovascularization is responsible for improvement in symptoms of plantar fasciitis. Neovascularization is the direct effect of macrophage stimulation through cytokines. ESWT has effects at the cellular level--does it interfere with metabolic activity or enhance it? The noninvasive nature and minimal complications of appropriately applied ESWT are its primary advantages. Symptoms may continue to improve for three weeks to six months after treatment; the effects of shock wave therapy seem to be time dependent. ESWT is an effective form of treatment for proximal insertional plantar fasciitis after exhaustive, conservative forms of treatment have failed.",
