  "title": "Regulated necrosis in COVID-19: A double-edged sword.",
  "abstract": "COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 can cause various systemic diseases such as acute pneumonia with cytokine storm. Constituted of necroptosis, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis, regulated necrosis constitutes the cell death patterns under the low apoptosis condition commonly observed in COVID-19. Regulated necrosis is involved in the release of cytokines like TNF-α, IL-1 β, and IL-6 and cell contents such as alarmins, PAMPs, and DAMPs, leading to more severe inflammation. Uncontrolled regulated necrosis may explain the poor prognosis and cytokine storm observed in COVID-19. In this review, the pathophysiology and mechanism of regulated necrosis with the double-edged sword effect in COVID-19 are thoroughly discussed in detail. Furthermore, this review also focuses on the biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets of the regulated necrosis pathway in COVID-19, providing practical guidance to judge the severity, prognosis, and clinical treatment of COVID-19 and guiding the development of clinical anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs.",
