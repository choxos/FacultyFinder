  "title": "Teaching evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine: 1. A learning structure for clinical decision changes.",
  "abstract": "Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) education is at a crossroads and has been an area of increasing debate. Public use of CAM has risen dramatically since 1997, with initial reports ranging from 30% to a possible 60% in the United States. Much attention has been directed to the education of the public regarding CAM, with respect to efficacy, potential harm, and integration. Far less attention has been paid to the education of CAM practitioners. In the current climate of integrative health settings, CAM practitioners should be trained to interact with conventional physicians, the public, and policy makers in an evidence-based format. In order to create communication effectively, an evidence-based approach may provide the common ground required for all schools of thought.",
