  "abstract": "Sperm navigation through the complex microarchitecture of the fallopian tube is essential for successful fertilization. Spatiotemporal structural alteration due to folded epithelium or muscle contractions in the fallopian tube changes the geometry of the sperm pathways. The role of structural complexity in sperm navigational patterns has been investigated for single sperm cells but has not been fully addressed at the population level. Here, we studied the dynamics of the navigation of a bull sperm population through obstructed pathways mimicking the architecture of the female reproductive tract. We observed that slightly tapered barriers enhance navigation by 20% compared to straight pathway; however, tapered barriers with a 90Â° angle restrict sperm passage. We demonstrated sperm cooperation while passing through a tapered pathway in a low-viscosity medium under elevated shear rates. These findings propose a fresh perspective on how sperm move through the fallopian tube, suggesting that the convoluted pathways' shape influences sperm navigation locally.",
