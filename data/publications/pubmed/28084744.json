  "title": "Unusual Exciton-Phonon Interactions at van der Waals Engineered Interfaces.",
  "abstract": "Raman scattering is a ubiquitous phenomenon in light-matter interactions, which reveals a material's electronic, structural, and thermal properties. Controlling this process would enable new ways of studying and manipulating fundamental material properties. Here, we report a novel Raman scattering process at the interface between different van der Waals (vdW) materials as well as between a monolayer semiconductor and 3D crystalline substrates. We find that interfacing a WSe2 monolayer with materials such as SiO2, sapphire, and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) enables Raman transitions with phonons that are either traditionally inactive or weak. This Raman scattering can be amplified by nearly 2 orders of magnitude when a foreign phonon mode is resonantly coupled to the A exciton in WSe2 directly or via an A1['] optical phonon from WSe2. We further showed that the interfacial Raman scattering is distinct between hBN-encapsulated and hBN-sandwiched WSe2 sample geometries. This cross-platform electron-phonon coupling, as well as the sensitivity of 2D excitons to their phononic environments, will prove important in the understanding and engineering of optoelectronic devices based on vdW heterostructures.",
