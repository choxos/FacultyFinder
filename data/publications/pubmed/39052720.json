  "title": "Effectiveness of Influenza Vaccination During Pregnancy Against Laboratory-Confirmed Seasonal Influenza Among Infants Under 6 Months of Age in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Randomized trials conducted in low- and middle-income settings demonstrated efficacy of influenza vaccination during pregnancy against influenza infection among infants <6 months of age. However, vaccine effectiveness (VE) estimates from settings with different population characteristics and influenza seasonality remain limited. METHODS: We conducted a test-negative study in Ontario, Canada. All influenza virus tests among infants <6 months from 2010 to 2019 were identified and linked with health databases to ascertain information on maternal-infant dyads. VE was estimated from the odds ratio for influenza vaccination during pregnancy among cases versus controls, computed using logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Among 23 806 infants tested for influenza, 1783 (7.5%) were positive and 1708 (7.2%) were born to mothers vaccinated against influenza during pregnancy. VE against laboratory-confirmed infant influenza infection was 64% (95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-74%). VE was similar by trimester of vaccination (first/second, 66% [95% CI, 40%-80%]; third, 63% [95% CI, 46%-74%]), infant age at testing (0 to <2 months, 63% [95% CI, 46%-75%]; 2 to <6 months, 64% [95% CI, 36%-79%]), and gestational age at birth (≥37 weeks, 64% [95% CI, 50%-75%]; < 37 weeks, 61% [95% CI, 4%-86%]). VE against influenza hospitalization was 67% (95% CI, 50%-78%). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination during pregnancy offers effective protection to infants <6 months, for whom vaccines are not currently available.",
