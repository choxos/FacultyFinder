  "title": "Demographic and Clinical Characteristics of Persons With Spinal Cord Injury in Bangladesh: Database for the International Spinal Cord Injury Community Survey 2023.",
  "abstract": "The study aims to explore the demographic and clinical characteristics of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI) in Bangladesh. A total of 3035 persons with SCI spanning from 2018 to 2022 were included in this cross-sectional study. Information about demographic and clinical variables was obtained from the medical records and verified through telephone calls to ensure accuracy and consistency. Approximately half (48.30%) of the study participants were located in Dhaka Division. The average age of persons with SCI was 38.3 years, with a standard deviation of 15.9 years, and the largest proportion (33.4%) fell within the age range of 18-30 years. Males outnumbered females by nearly 2.5 times. In the study, 59.6% had suffered traumatic injuries, whereas 40.4% had SCI attributable to disease-related causes; 58.1% were diagnosed with tetraplegia and 40.1% with paraplegia. Fall from height (42.1%) and road traffic trauma (27%) were the most common causes of traumatic injuries. Degenerative myelopathy (41.1%) was the most frequent cause of non-traumatic SCI, followed by tumors (27.7%) and tuberculosis (TB; 14.8%). Both traumatic (58.3%) and degenerative (56.7%) causes of SCI commonly affected the cervical spine, whereas TB (24.4%) and tumors (47.5%) had a higher incidence of affecting the dorsal spine. In the absence of a registry or national database for patients with SCI in Bangladesh, this study would serve as representative data for future studies.",
