  "title": "Palbociclib in Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcoma With CDK4 Amplifications: Results From the Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry Study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Targeted Agent and Profiling Utilization Registry (TAPUR) is a phase II basket trial evaluating the antitumor activity of commercially available targeted agents in patients with advanced cancer and genomic alterations known to be drug targets. Results of a cohort of patients with soft tissue sarcoma with cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplification treated with palbociclib are reported. METHODS: Eligible patients had measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, adequate organ function, and no standard treatment options. The primary end point was disease control (DC), defined as objective response (OR) or stable disease (SD) of at least 16+ weeks duration (SD16+) according to RECIST v1.1. The DC rate was estimated with a 90% CI. Secondary end points included OR, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, duration of SD, and safety. RESULTS: Forty-two patients with CDK4 amplification were enrolled. One patient was not evaluable for efficacy. One patient with partial response and 18 with SD16+ were observed for DC and OR rates of 46% (90% CI, 36 to 100) and 2% (95% CI, <1 to 13), respectively. Median PFS was 16 weeks (95% CI, 9 to 28) and median OS was 69 weeks (95% CI, 31 to 111) for evaluable patients. Twenty patients had at least one grade 3 to 4 adverse event (AE) at least possibly related to palbociclib, including alanine aminotransferase increase, anemia, fatigue, hypophosphatemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. No serious AEs were reported. CONCLUSION: Palbociclib met prespecified criteria to declare a signal of antitumor activity in patients with sarcoma and CDK4 amplification.",
