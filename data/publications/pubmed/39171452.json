  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) plays a vital role in public health practice. Canada has invested in support for evidence-informed approaches in public health. Despite growing expectations for EIDM, evidence integration has not been thoroughly evaluated. OBJECTIVE: This study explores EIDM within Canadian public health organizations before the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to explore how EIDM in public health was affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Using a qualitative descriptive approach, data were collected and analyzed from interviews with public health professionals across Canada. RESULTS: From interviews with 20 participants in four Canadian provinces and one territory, all participants noted that EIDM was valued, but there was considerable variation in implementation. Participants reported differences in consistency of evidence use, resources available at their public health organizations to support EIDM, and staff knowledge and skills in EIDM. Leadership emerged as a strong influencer of EIDM; however, leadership investment in EIDM varied. Changes in evidence use during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed an urgency for decision-making amidst an influx of evidence and reallocated staff roles. CONCLUSIONS: Despite gains in the recognized value of EIDM, gaps remain in the integration of evidence into decision-making and adequate resource investment to support EIDM. Time, resources, and skills to adapt processes and implement EIDM are needed for public health organizations in Canada to fully integrate EIDM into all aspects of public health decision-making.
