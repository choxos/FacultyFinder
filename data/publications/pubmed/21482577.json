  "abstract": "Suture-mediated closure devices have been previously described as an interesting alternative to femoral cutdown during endovascular aortic procedures. The insertion of two or three devices before the cannulation (preclose technique) permits successful percutaneous access also with a large sheath up to 24 Fr diameter. The main benefit of percutaneous access is a lower rate of complication at the groin. The same technique can be applied to cardiac procedures where femoral cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is required. We report a series of 12 patients in whom total percutaneous CPB was successfully established using a Perclose ProGlide for the arterial access.",
