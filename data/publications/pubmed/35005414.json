  "title": "Predictors of persistent postsurgical pain following total knee arthroplasty: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Background: Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a commonly performed procedure, primarily when knee joints have been damaged by progressive arthritis; however, over 20% of surgical patients develop persistent postsurgical pain (PPSP). We plan to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of factors associated with the development of PPSP following TKA. Methods: We will include peer-reviewed cohort or case-control studies that explore, in an adjusted model, factors associated with the development of PPSP after TKA. We will identify eligible studies, in any language, by a systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO, from inception of each database. Pairs of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, screen titles and abstracts of identified citations, review the full texts of potentially eligible studies, and extract information from eligible studies. When possible, we will pool estimates of association for all independent variables reported by more than one study and report both an adjusted odds ratio and the absolute risk increase and associated 95% confidence intervals (Cis). We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to summarize the quality of evidence for all meta-analyses as high, moderate, low, or very low. Discussion: Our results will facilitate identification of patients at risk for the development of PPSP following TKA, highlight promising predictors for further study, and help guide the design of interventional studies to improve prognosis of high-risk patients.",
