  "title": "Lead smelting alters wheat flour heavy metal concentrations and health risks.",
  "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour consumption may be a major source of human metal intake, especially when wheat is cultivated in metal-contaminated soils. This work investigated Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn distribution in whole wheat flour, wheat flour, and wheat bran when grown in an area polluted by Pb smelting. Wheat product heavy metal concentrations were analyzed, and the (non)carcinogenic risks were assessed. Mean Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations in whole wheat flour were 0.38, 3.83, 0.48, and 29.3 mg kg[-1] , respectively; those in flour were only slightly reduced. The ratios between noncarcinogenic average daily dose of whole wheat flour and wheat flour consumption ranged from 1.06 to 3.76, with Pb having the greatest values compared with other metals. For children, the average hazard quotients (HQs) of whole wheat flour consumption of Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn were 4.19, 1.06, 1.53, and 1.07; those for wheat flour consumption were 3.81, 0.68, 0.70, and 0.98, respectively. The HQs of adults were less than those of children. Overall results indicated that consumption of wheat products may lead to health concerns in the heavy metal contaminated area, yet when wheat flour rather than whole wheat flour is consumed, only the human health risk from Pb ingestion is reduced. Altering or removing human edible crops in the most contaminated areas should be considered.",
