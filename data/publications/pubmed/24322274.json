  "abstract": "Innate-like lymphocytes are a recently described subset of the immune response with known antibacterial properties. This human trial in critically ill patients provides the first evidence of the drop in MAIT cells during bacterial sepsis, which compounds the already known immune defects. The persistent depletion and potential for nosocomial infections is an interesting finding and one likely to provide fertile grounds for future studies.",
