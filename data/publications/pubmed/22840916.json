  "title": "Are patients with inflammatory bowel disease at increased risk of coronary artery disease?",
  "abstract": "The inflammatory state of atherosclerosis has been established as those with chronic inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, who are at increased risk of coronary artery disease. A systematic search was conducted to retrieve high-quality, peer-reviewed studies of inflammatory bowel disease and coronary artery disease. Recent literature supports an association between inflammatory bowel disease and coronary artery disease. While hypertension increases the risk of coronary artery disease in inflammatory bowel disease patients, other typical risk factors have not been confirmed, and markers of inflammation may predict coronary artery disease risk in this population. Common cardiovascular drugs such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may have dual potential for controlling inflammatory bowel disease and preventing or treating coronary artery disease. Large, prospective, longitudinal studies can help to determine the true prevalence of coronary artery disease in this population and confirm risk factors. In the absence of such evidence, physicians should be cognizant of increased coronary artery disease risk in inflammatory bowel disease patients without traditional risk factors and consider primary preventive strategies.",
