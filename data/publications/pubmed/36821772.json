  "title": "Impact of vincristine-steroid pulses during maintenance for B-cell pediatric ALL: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "The benefit associated with the incorporation of vincristine-corticosteroid pulses in maintenance therapy for pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear, particularly in the context of modern intensive therapy. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of reducing the frequency of vincristine-steroid pulses during maintenance for pediatric patients newly diagnosed with B-cell ALL. Two authors reviewed all eligible studies identified through a comprehensive search, extracted data from 25 publications (12 513 patients), and assessed the risk of bias. We created historical and contemporary subgroups; the latter included trials providing both a version of Protocol III from the early Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster trials and eliminating routine prophylactic cranial radiation. Meta-analysis of event-free survival data suggested no benefit between more frequent or less frequent pulses in contemporary trials (hazard ratio [HR], 0.96; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-1.09), which differed significantly from historical trials (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.91; P = .04). We found no significant impact of reduced pulse frequency on overall survival or relapse risk. There was however increased odds of grade 3+ nonhepatic toxicity in the high-pulse frequency group (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.12-1.52). This systematic review suggests that the previous benefit conferred by frequent pulses of vincristine-steroids in maintenance therapy for pediatric B-cell ALL in historical trials no longer applies in contemporary trials but is associated with toxicity. These results will help guide the development of the next phase of clinical trials in the field of pediatric ALL and question the continued use of pulses in maintenance among patients not in clinical trials, particularly those experiencing toxicity.",
