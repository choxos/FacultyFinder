  "title": "Understanding the Health Burden of Macromastia: Normative Data for the BREAST-Q Reduction Module.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The BREAST-Q Reduction module evaluates outcomes in reduction mammaplasty. However, there are currently no published normative scores, limiting the interpretation of BREAST-Q data. METHODS: The BREAST-Q Reduction module was administered via the Army of Women, an online community of women (with and without breast cancer) engaged in breast-cancer related research. Normative data were generated from women aged 18 years and older, without a history of breast cancer or breast surgery. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics and a linear multivariate regression. Generated normative data were compared to published BREAST-Q Reduction findings. RESULTS: The preoperative version of the BREAST-Q Reduction module was completed by 1206 women. Participant mean age was 55 ± 13 years, mean body mass index was 27 ± 6 kg/m, and 40 percent (n = 481) had a bra cup size ≥ D. Mean normative scores were as follows: Satisfaction with Breasts, 57 ± 16; Psychosocial Well-being, 68 ± 19; Sexual Well-being, 55 ± 19; and Physical Well-being, 76 ± 11. Normative scores were lower in women with body mass index ≥ 30 and bra cup size ≥ D. In comparison to normative Army of Women scores, published BREAST-Q scores for women undergoing reduction mammaplasty were lower (worse) for preoperative patients and higher (better) for postoperative patients. CONCLUSION: These new Army of Women normative data provide insights into breast-related satisfaction and well-being in women not pursuing breast reduction, giving new clinical context to better understand the health burden of macromastia, and to demonstrate the value of reduction mammaplasty in certain patients.",
