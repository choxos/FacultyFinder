  "title": "Systematic Review and Expert Consensus on the Use of Orthoses (Splints and Casts) with Adults and Children after Burn Injury to Determine Practice Guidelines.",
  "abstract": "The objective of this review was to systematically evaluate the available literature addressing the use of orthoses (splints and casts) with adult and pediatric burn survivors and determine whether practice guidelines could be proposed. This review provides evidence-based recommendations specifically for rehabilitation professionals who are responsible for burn survivor rehabilitation. A summary recommendation was made after the literature was retrieved using a systematic review and critical appraisal by multiple authors. The level of evidence of the literature was determined in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine criteria. Due to the low level of evidence in the available literature, only one practice guideline could be recommended: orthotic use should be considered as a treatment choice for improving range of motion or reducing contracture in adults who have sustained a burn injury. To address the rehabilitation-specific gaps found in the literature regarding orthotic use in burn rehabilitation and provide guidance to clinicians, a formal expert consensus exercise was conducted as a final step to the project. The resultant manuscript provides a summary of the literature regarding orthotic use with burn patients, one practice guideline, proposed orthotic terminology and additional practice recommendations based on expert opinion. The limitations in the current literature are also discussed, and suggestions are made for future studies in the area of orthotic use after burn injury.",
