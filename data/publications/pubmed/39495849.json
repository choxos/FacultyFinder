  "title": "The effect of cordycepin on renal damage by correcting hypothyroidism.",
  "abstract": "The paper investigated the effect of cordycepin on renal damage induced by hypothyroidism and studied the effect of thyroid function recovery on renal damage. The hypothyroid rat model was established by continuous intragastric administration of propylthiouracil (PTU). The general state, thyroid function, renal function, blood lipid, pathological changes and damage of kidney tissues of rats in each group. The expressions of MCP-1 and Desmin proteins, which is a marker of podocyte damage, in the kidney were all detected by immunohistochemistry. The result of thyroid function examination was consistent with the characteristics of hypothyroidism. The renal damage and lipid metabolism disorder appeared in the hypothyroidism rats along with the progression of the disease, with the blood lipid increased and the expression of MCP-1 increased. Using this model to study the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism renal damage is more clinically practical and the administration of Cordycepin can improve the symptoms. Cordycepin can improve thyroid function, and can significantly alleviate renal damage in rats. By correcting thyroid function, Cordycepin can reduce renal damage and blood lipid, reduce the expressions of MCP-1 and Desmin proteins, thus delaying the progress of renal damage and protecting the kidney.",
