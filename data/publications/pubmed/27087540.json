  "title": "Effect of sleeve gastrectomy bariatric surgery-induced weight loss on serum AMH levels in reproductive aged women.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the change in serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) levels in patients with morbid obesity undergoing bariatric surgery for weight loss. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective observational study, 75 patients of reproductive age (20-35 years) undergoing bariatric surgery for morbid obesity were followed up after six months to determine the changes in weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), menstrual pattern and serum AMH. The results were further studied on basis of pre operative classification of patients in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and non-PCOS group. RESULT: The serum AMH levels were statistically higher in patients of PCOS group pre operatively and at the end of six months in comparison to non-PCOS patients. The AMH values reduced post operatively in both groups significantly so much in the values though not significant statistically. Non-PCOS patients had lower AMH values pre operatively and showed a trend towards reducing ovarian reserve after six months. The overall change in AMH values in both groups was statistically significant as was the normalization of menstrual irregularity. CONCLUSION: Morbidly obese patients with PCOS appear to benefit from bariatric surgery both in terms of regularization of menstrual function and normalization of serum AMH values.",
