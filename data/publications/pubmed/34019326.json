  "title": "Treatment of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder with poor prognostic features in children and young adults: Short-course EPOCH regimens are safe and effective.",
  "abstract": "No guidelines exist for which intensive chemotherapy regimen is best in pediatric or young adult patients with high-risk posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). We retrospectively reviewed patients with PTLD who received interval-compressed short-course etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (SC-EPOCH) regimens at our institution. Eight patients were included with median age of 12 years. All patients achieved a complete response with a manageable toxicity profile. Two patients developed second, clonally unrelated, EBV-positive PTLD and one patient had recurrence at 6 months off therapy. No graft rejection occurred during therapy. All eight patients are alive with median follow-up of 29 months.",
