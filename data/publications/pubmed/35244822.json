  "title": "The Negative Effect of Social Discrimination on Pain Tolerance and the Moderating Role of Pain Catastrophizing.",
  "abstract": "This study examined the negative impact of social discrimination on the time to pain tolerance during experimentally induced cold pressor pain among healthy individuals. It was hypothesized that the degree to which one catastrophized about pain would exacerbate the negative impact of a history discriminatory experiences on pain tolerance, and that this interaction would be different between individuals of a racial and ethnic minority and non-Hispanic white individuals (thus testing catastrophizing as a moderated moderator). Higher levels of discrimination were positively related to catastrophic thinking about pain, and there was a significant negative relationship between the level of experienced discrimination and time to pain tolerance. Pain catastrophizing emerged as a significant moderator in that when pain catastrophizing levels were high, there was no association between social discrimination and pain tolerance. A history of social discrimination was significantly associated with reduced pain tolerance at low and moderate levels of pain catastrophizing. Racial minority status did not significantly alter this moderating relationship. Implications for the importance of assessing sociocultural variables, such as experiencing social discrimination in the clinical assessment of the individual with pain are outlined.",
