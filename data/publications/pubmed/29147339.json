  "title": "Recurrent Adenocarcinoma of Colon Presenting as Duodenal Metastasis With Partial Gastric Outlet Obstruction: A Case Report With Review of Literature.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in western world. While most common site for metastasis for colon cancer is liver, lung, and the peritoneum, metastasis to various other organs such as brain, bones and thyroid has been reported. Metastatic lesions to the small bowel are more common than primary lesions and most common primary neoplasms that metastasize to the duodenum are lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma. We report a very rare case of recurrent adenocarcinoma of colon metastasizing to duodenum after 2 years of curative resection of primary cancer. Surgical resection for curative intent as well as palliative management is recommended.",
