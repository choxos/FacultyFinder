  "title": "[The BMJ Rapid Recommendations: towards a new model for the production of clinical practice guidelines].",
  "abstract": "Guidelines play a central role in clinical practice, but their development often does not meet trustworthiness standards, which makes them vulnerable to conflict of interest. Additional problems -include their insufficient updating, and current formats that do not support shared decision-making. To address these issues, we have created the Rapid Recommendations, in collaboration with the British -Medical Journal. In this innovative approach, we a) identify new practice-changing evidence ; b) incorporate them in updated -systematics reviews in about 45 days ; c) gather an international and unconflicted panel including patients and d) publish trust-worthy recommendation in about 90 days, along with new multilayered evidence summaries and tools that facilitate shared decision-making.",
