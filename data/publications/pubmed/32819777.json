  "title": "Reporting Outcomes and Outcome Measures in Thumb Carpometacarpal Joint Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: In the thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint osteoarthritis (OA) literature, there is substantial heterogeneity in outcome and outcome measure reporting. This could be rectified by a standardized core outcome set (COS). This study aimed to identify a comprehensive list of outcomes and outcome measures for thumb CMC joint OA, which represents the first step in developing a COS. METHODS: A computerized search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane, and CINAHL was performed to identify randomized controlled trials, as well as observational studies involving at least 50 participants aged greater than 18 years undergoing surgery for thumb CMC joint OA. Reported outcomes and outcome measures were extracted from these trials and summarized. RESULTS: This search yielded 3,498 unique articles, 97 of which were used for analysis. A total of 33 unique outcomes and 25 unique outcome measures were identified. The most frequently used outcomes were complications (78), postoperative pain (73), radiologic outcomes (64), and grip strength (63). Within each reported outcome, there was substantial variation in how the outcome was measured. Of the 25 unique outcome measures, 10 were validated. Of the remaining 15, 12 were created ad hoc by the author. The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand questionnaire was the most commonly reported outcome measure (34%). CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of consensus on critical outcomes after surgery for thumb CMC joint OA. A standardized COS created by stakeholder consensus would improve the consistency and therefore the quality of future research. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This systematic review of outcomes represents the first step in developing a core outcome set for thumb CMC joint OA.",
