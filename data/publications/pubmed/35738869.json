  "title": "Physical exercise and fatigue in advanced gastrointestinal cancer during chemotherapy.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to analyse the effect of a patient-oriented modality of physical exercise (programmed and directed physical exercise (PDPE)) on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) and quality of life (QoL). The secondary aim was to evaluate changes in body composition and skeletal muscle function during the study in patients with and without PDPE. METHODS: A prospective randomised study was conducted to analyse the impact of PDPE on CRF and QoL. Patients were selected before the development of CRF to set the intervention before its appearance. A high probability CRF population was chosen: patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer undergoing chemotherapy with weight loss (≥5%) over the last 6 months. PDPE consisted of a programme of exercise delivered weekly and adjusted to patients' medical conditions. Four visits were planned (weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12). QoL, CRF, body composition and skeletal muscle function were evaluated in each visit. RESULTS: From 101 patients recruited, 64 were considered evaluable, with three or four visits completed (n=30 control, n=34 PDPE group). Satisfactory compliance of ≥50% to the PDPE programme was seen in 47%. A reduction in the severity of fatigue was detected in the PDPE group (p=0.019), being higher in the subgroup of satisfactory compliance (p<0.001). This latter group showed better results of QoL in comparison with the control group (p=0.0279). A significant increase in endurance was found in the PDPE group (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: PDPE reduced the severity of fatigue and improved QoL. The difference in endurance would explain the results seen in the severity of fatigue.",
