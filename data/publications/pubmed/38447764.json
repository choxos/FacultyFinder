  "title": "Recurrence of new-onset post-operative AF after cardiac surgery: detected by implantable loop recorders: A systematic review and Meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common complications after cardiac surgery. New-onset post-operative AF may signal an elevated risk of AF and associated outcomes in long-term follow-up. We aimed to estimate the rate of AF recurrence as detected by an implantable loop recorder (ILR) in patients experiencing post-operative AF within 30 days after cardiac surgery. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL to April 2023 for studies of adults who did not have known AF, experienced new-onset AF within 30 days of cardiac surgery and received an ILR. We pooled individual participant data on timing of AF recurrence using a random-effects model with a frailty model applied to a Cox proportional hazard analysis. RESULTS: From 8671 citations, 8 single-centre prospective cohort studies met eligibility criteria. Data were available from 185 participants in 7 studies, with a median follow-up of 1.7 (IQR: 1.3-2.8) years. All included studies were at a low risk of bias. Pooled AF recurrence rates following 30 post-operative days were 17.8% (95% CI 11.9%-23.2%) at 3 months, 24.4% (17.7%-30.6%) at 6 months, 30.1% (22.8%-36.7%) at 12 months and 35.3% (27.6%-42.2%) at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: In patients who experience new-onset post-operative AF after cardiac surgery, AF recurrence lasting at least 30 s occurs in approximately 1 in 3 in the first year after surgery. The optimal frequency and modality to use for monitoring for AF recurrence in this population remain uncertain.",
