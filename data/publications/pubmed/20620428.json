  "abstract": "This paper provides an overview of key achievements of the Framingham Heart Study and identifies areas and approaches for future research in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and prevention. There is a need for a range of different studies using diverse designs (i.e. case-control, cohort, multi-community, birth cohort, family-based cohorts and randomized trials) in different settings and involving multiple ethnic groups. Incorporation of a range of new disciplines, such as genetics, behavioural sciences, social epidemiology, measures of the environment, geography, and health policy are required to understand the root determinants of cardiovascular diseases.",
