  "title": "A History of Musculoskeletal Medicine and Its Place and Progress in Undergraduate Medical Education.",
  "abstract": "Musculoskeletal diseases are responsible for some of the most prevalent conditions affecting population health in the world. Despite the prevalence of these conditions, musculoskeletal medicine has a fraught history within the world of undergraduate medical education. We review the origins of musculoskeletal medicine, its evolution in undergraduate medical education, and progress that has been made over the last decade as a result of global initiatives such as the Bone and Joint Decade. Understanding the history of musculoskeletal medicine is essential to contextualizing the problems that exist today and creating comprehensive solutions to fill the gaps that persist in musculoskeletal curricula.",
