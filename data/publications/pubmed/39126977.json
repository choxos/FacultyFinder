  "title": "Non-coding RNAs as key regulators of Gasdermin-D mediated pyroptosis in cancer therapy.",
  "abstract": "Pyroptosis is an inflammatory programed cell death process that plays a crucial role in cancer therapeutic, while Gasdermin-D is a critical effector protein for pyroptosis execution. This review discusses the intricate interactions between Gasdermin-D and some non-coding RNAs (lncRNA, miRNA, siRNA) and their potential application in the regulation of pyroptosis as an anticancer therapy. Correspondingly, these ncRNAs significantly implicate in Gasdermin-D expression and function regarding the pyroptosis pathway. Functioning as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs), these ncRNAs might regulate Gasdermin-D at the molecular level, underlying fatal cell death caused by cancer and tumor propagation. Therefore, these interactions appeal to therapeutics, offering new avenues for cancer treatment. It address this research gap by discussing the possible roles of ncRNAs as mediators of gasdermin-D regulation. It suggest therapeutic strategies based on the current research findings to ensure the interchange between the ideal pyroptosis and cancer cell death.",
