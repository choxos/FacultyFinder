  "abstract": "Objective To investigate the preventive therapeutic effect and possible mechanism of single chain variable fragments chimeric protein (SD) of ovalbumin epitopes internalizing receptor DEC-205 antibody on food allergy in mice. Methods Mice were randomly divided to five groups (control, PBS, scFv DEC 100 μg, SD 50 μg, SD 100 μg) and treated for 24 hours before OVA administration. After challenge, the serum level of OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2a and IL-4 were detected by ELISA. Infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells in the jejunum was observed by HE staining and toluidine blue staining respectively. The bone marrow of tibia and femur was isolated and cultured to obtain immature dendritic cells(BMDCs), which were further treated with LPS (10 ng/mL), TSLP (50 ng/mL), scFv DEC protein (1000 ng/mL) and SD protein (10,100,1000)ng/mL for 24 hours, and the IL-10 level of supernatant was assayed by ELISA. Results Compared with PBS group, the number of SD-treated mice with diarrhea was markedly reduced. The difference in rectal temperature and the levels of serum OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, IgG2a and IL-4 decreased significantly after prophylactic administration of SD; The number of eosinophils and mast cells in jejunum also decreased significantly while the IL-10 level in the supernatant of BMDCs increased significantly after SD intervention. Conclusion SD mitigates experimental FA response by fosters the immune tolerance property of dendritic cells.",
