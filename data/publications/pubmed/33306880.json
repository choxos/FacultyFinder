  "title": "TAVR prosthesis recoil: Unknowns and implications.",
  "abstract": "TAVR acute recoil has not been properly assessed with current generation balloon-expandable prosthesis. Acute recoil was greater during initial deployment than in postdilatation, in middle stent than inflow or outflow, and in antero-posterior than lateral axis. No predictors or clinical implications of acute valvular recoil were detected, calling for further research to better understand this phenomenon.",
