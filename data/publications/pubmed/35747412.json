  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We report characteristics and outcomes of adults admitted to Canadian Immunization Research Network (CIRN) Serious Outcomes Surveillance (SOS) Network hospitals with COVID-19 in 2020. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 admitted to 11 sites in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and Nova Scotia up to December 31, 2020 were enrolled in this prospective observational cohort study. Measures included age, sex, demographics, housing, exposures, Clinical Frailty Scale, comorbidities; in addition, length of stay, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, mechanical ventilation, and survival were assessed. Descriptive analyses and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted. RESULTS: Among 2,011 patients, mean age was 71.0 (range 19-105) years. 29.7% were admitted from assisted living or long-term care facilities. The full spectrum of frailty was represented in both younger and older age groups. 81.8% had at least one underlying comorbidity and 27.2% had obesity. Mortality was 14.3% without ICU admission, and 24.6% for those admitted to ICU. Older age and frailty were independent predictors of lower ICU use and higher mortality; accounting for frailty, obesity was not an independent predictor of mortality, and associations of comorbidities with mortality were weakened. CONCLUSIONS: Frailty is a critical clinical factor in predicting outcomes of COVID-19, which should be considered in research and clinical settings.",
