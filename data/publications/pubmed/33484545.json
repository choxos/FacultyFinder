  "title": "Giant lipoma of submandibular region; an unusual presentation.",
  "abstract": "Lipomas in the submandibular region are very uncommon. Large submandibular neck mass (greater than 10 cm) with a rapid growth rate, may raise concern about possible malignancy of salivary glands. Failure to distinguish salivary gland tumour and liposarcoma from a lipoma may represent a medico-legal pitfall. It is very important for the surgeon to rule out liposarcomas when dealing with giant lipomas in such regions. We report a case of a 65-year-old male who presented in the OPD with complains of pain and a 15x12 cm, giant submandibular solitary lipoma of anterior neck which had rapidly increased in size. The diagnosis of lipoma was confirmed on physical examination, radiological investigations and Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC). The Patient underwent surgical excision. The surgery produced excellent cosmetic results and no functional impairment. This study illustrates the literature regarding aetiology, epidemiology, followed by diagnostic and treatment modalities of submandibular lipomas.",
