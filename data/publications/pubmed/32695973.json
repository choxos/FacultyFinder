  "title": "Management of Acute Decompensated Heart Failure in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit: The Importance of Co-management With a Heart Failure Specialist.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a common reason for admission to the cardiac intensive care unit. We sought to identify the role of an HF consultation service in improving the management of this patient population. METHODS: We identified all adult patients admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit (2014-2015) at the University Health Network with a diagnosis of acute decompensated HF Â± cardiogenic shock (CS). Clinical characteristics and course were recorded. We calculated a propensity score-adjusted association between HF consultation and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 285 unique patients were identified in our cohort. Of these, 82 (28.7%) died. A total of 150 patients (52.6%) were co-managed by an HF service, and 135 patients (47.3%) were not. Patients who were managed by an HF team were younger (52.5 vs 68.0 years, P < 0.0001), were more likely to be admitted with CS (61.3 vs 41.5%, P < 0.0009), and had higher rates of vasoactive medications during their admission (69.3% vs 52.6%, P < 0.005). At discharge, there were higher rates of discharge to a HF clinic (52.0% vs 27.5%, P < 0.0001) and prescription of guideline-directed medical therapy. In-hospital mortality was lower in those co-managed by a HF team (16.7% vs 42.2%, P < 0.0001). HF consultation reduced the odds of readmission by 76% (odds ratio, 0.24; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Patients managed by a HF team were more likely to be in CS at admission, to survive to discharge from hospital, and to be initiated on guideline-directed medical therapy with HF follow-up.",
