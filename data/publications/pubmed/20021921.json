  "title": "[Effects of amlodipine plus telmisartan or amlodipine plus amiloride regimen on blood pressure control in hypertensive patients: preliminary report of Chinese Hypertension Intervention Efficacy (CHIEF) trial].",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of amlodipine-based antihypertensive combination regimen on blood pressure control and impact on cardiovascular events. METHODS: From Oct. 2007 to Oct. 2008, a total of 13 542 hypertensive patients from 180 centers in China were included in this multi-centre randomized, controlled, blind-endpoint assessment clinical trial. Inclusion criteria were: essential hypertension, 50 - 79 years of age with at least one cardiovascular risk factor and signed consent forms. Patients were randomly assigned to receive low-dose amlodipine + diuretics (group A) or low-dose amlodipine + telmisartan (group T). The primary endpoints are composite of non-fatal stroke/myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death. All patients will be followed-up for 4 years. RESULTS: The characteristics of patients between the two groups were similar: mean age (61.5 +/- 7.7) Yrs with 19% history of cerebrovascular diseases, 12% coronary diseases, 18% diabetes, 42% dyslipidemia, mean initial blood pressure 157/93 mm Hg. After 8-week treatment, mean blood pressure in group A and B were reduced to (133.0 +/- 11.0)/(81.0 +/- 7.6) mm Hg, (132.9 +/- 11.6)/(80.6 +/- 7.9) mm Hg respectively. Blood pressure control rates reached 72.1% and 72.6% in group A and T, respectively. CONCLUSION: Amlodipine-based antihypertensive combination regimens achieved satisfactory blood pressure control rate in patients with essential hypertension in this patient cohort.",
