  "title": "Shared decision-making and patient and public involvement: Can they become standard in Switzerland?",
  "abstract": "The Swiss healthcare system is highly decentralized, making implementation of shared decision making (SDM) and patient and public involvement (PPI) quite slow; nonetheless, change is happening. SDM is now a core communication competency for medical school graduates, as reflected by a dedicated station on the federal exam, and is endorsed by several national societies. Multiple local initiatives are contributing to international best practices, local implementation, and increased capacity. PPI is also gaining momentum, most notably in research, with the development of a national platform for clinical research and inclusion of patients in the evaluation committees for funding. The challenge now is going from example projects by motivated early adopters in academia to making SDM and PPI standard practice.",
