  "title": "Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists and the Risk of Emergency Department Visits and Hospitalization in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) versus dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP4i) initiation on emergency department (ED) visits and all-cause hospitalizations across the spectrum of kidney disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based observational cohort study in adults with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <90 mL/min/1.73 m2 using inverse probability of treatment weighting. The Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) gap time model was used for the primary analysis. RESULTS: The cohort included 24,576 new users of a GLP-1RA and 23,600 DPP4i new users. GLP1RA initiation was associated with a lower risk of all-cause ED encounters or hospitalizations (hazard ratio [HR] 0.90; 95% CI 0.87-0.94; P < 0.0001). This finding was consistent in confirmatory analyses using the Andersen-Gill model and the PWP calendar time model. CONCLUSIONS: GLP-1RA initiation was associated with a reduction in all-cause ED visits and hospitalizations compared with new use of a DPP4i.",
