  "abstract": "Leptospirosis is an important zoonotic disease with several maintenance host species including swine. A cross sectional survey was undertaken between January to October 2020 to investigate the prevalence of leptospirosis in farmed swine in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China. Serum samples were collected from swine on seven farms (15 swine per farm; ten multiparous sows and five twelve-week-old weaners), while kidney samples were collected from 64 swine submitted for routine post-mortem (26 farms; average 2.4 swine per farm, range 1-6). Microscopic agglutination tests (MAT) to a panel of 24 Leptospira antigens did not reveal any evidence of seroconversion at a titre of 1:100. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the kidney samples for Leptospira DNA did not detect any evidence of infection. Bayesian methods were used to compute the probability that the leptospirosis prevalence in farmed swine in the HKSAR was <3%, given none of the 105 swine sampled were positive on the MAT. The results of this study demonstrate no serological or molecular evidence of leptospirosis in farmed swine in the HKSAR. Subsequent statistical analysis supports the conclusion that the prevalence of leptospirosis in farmed swine in the HKSAR is negligible at present.",
