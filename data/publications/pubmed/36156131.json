  "abstract": "AIMS: High-risk cardiac surgery is commonly complicated by low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), which is associated with high mortality. There are limited data derived from multi-centre studies with adjudicated endpoints describing factors associated with LCOS and its downstream clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: The Levosimendan in Patients with Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction Undergoing Cardiac Surgery Requiring Cardiopulmonary Bypass (LEVO-CTS) trial evaluated prophylactic levosimendan vs. placebo in patients with a reduced ejection fraction undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery. We conducted a pre-specified analysis on LCOS, which was characterized by a four-part definition. We constructed a multivariable logistical regression model to evaluate risk factors associated with LCOS and performed Cox proportional hazards modelling to determine the association of LCOS with 90-day mortality. A total of 186 (22%) of 849 patients in the LEVO-CTS trial developed LCOS. The factors most associated with a higher adjusted risk of LCOS were pre-operative ejection fraction [odds ratio (OR) 1.26; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-1.46 per 5% decrease] and age (OR 1.13; 95% CI: 1.04-1.24 per 5-year increase), whereas isolated CABG surgery (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.64) and levosimendan use (OR 0.65; 95% CI: 0.46-0.92) were associated with a lower risk of LCOS. Patients with LCOS had worse outcomes, including renal replacement therapy at 30-day (10 vs. 1%) and 90-day mortality (16 vs. 3%, adjusted hazard ratio of 5.04, 95% CI: 2.66-9.55). CONCLUSION: Low cardiac output syndrome is associated with a high risk of post-operative mortality in high-risk cardiac surgery.",
