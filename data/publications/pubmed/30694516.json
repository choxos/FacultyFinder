  "abstract": "This study examined the potential of the short form of the Quantitative Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (Q-CHAT-10) to identify autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in a high-risk sibling cohort. High-risk (HR; siblings of children diagnosed with ASD) and low-risk (LR; no family history of ASD) toddlers were assessed prospectively at 18 and 24 months of age using the Q-CHAT-10 and underwent blind diagnostic assessment for ASD at 36 months of age. The results indicated that at 18 and 24 months, total score differentiated between HR toddlers subsequently diagnosed with ASD from other HR and LR toddlers. The sensitivity at both time points was acceptable; however, the specificity was below the level recommended for clinical application.",
