  "abstract": "Zero vegetable or fruit and egg and/or flesh foods are the latest indicators for assessing infant and young child feeding practices. Understanding national and subnational heterogeneity and regional clustering in children with SSA is becoming increasingly essential for geographic targeting and policy prioritization. Geographical case identification, determinants, and impacts were all investigated. SSA children's consumption of vegetable or fruit, egg and/or flesh food, and both were low. In SSA, some portions of the Southern, South direction of the Western and Central regions have a lower weight of all bad conditions than others, although children continue to suffer in considerable numbers in all disadvantage circumstances. Children under the age of 1 year, from rural areas, uneducated families, and low income were all disadvantaged by both feeding techniques. To improve child nutrition status, multisectoral collaboration is essential. This framework allows for the tracking, planning, and implementation of nutritional treatments.",
