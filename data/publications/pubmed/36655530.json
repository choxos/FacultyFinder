  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide. Current treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are limited by severe side effects and the development of resistance. OBJECTIVE: Therefore, it is important to find additional therapies to combat the problem. Ginsenoside Rb1 is the main active ingredient of ginseng, which is a well-known herb in traditional Chinese medicine. Ginsenoside is reported to play an important role in the prevention and treatment of cancer. METHODS: We established Azoxymethane (AOM)/Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colon cancer model based on inflammation, observed the beneficial effect of ginsenoside Rb1, and detected the changes in gut microbiota. RESULTS: Our experimental results showed that ginsenoside Rb1 significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α, IL-6, IL- 17A, IL-33, IL-1β, and IL-22, increased the level of IL-10, and also changed the gut microbiota composition. These results suggested that ginsenoside Rb1 can be used to prevent inflammation-associated CRC development and may provide an effective therapeutic strategy for CRC by relieving chronic inflammation and restoring the gut microenvironment in the AOM/DSS-induced model of colitis-associated colorectal cancer in mice. CONCLUSION: Ginsenoside Rb1 significantly attenuated AOM/DSS-induced colon carcinogenesis.",
