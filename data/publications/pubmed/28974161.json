  "title": "Consistent Condom Use with Paying and Nonpaying Partners among Female Sex Workers in Iran: Findings of a National Biobehavioral Survey.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Little is known about the dynamics of condom use among female sex workers (FSWs) in Iran. We investigated the correlates of consistent condom use (CCU) among FSWs, using data from a national biobehavioral surveillance survey in 2010. METHODS: A total of 872 FSWs were recruited using a facility-based sampling strategy from 21 sites in 13 cities in Iran. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. RESULTS: Overall, 33.6% and 17.3% of FSWs reported CCU with paying and nonpaying sex partners, respectively. Consistent condom use with paying partners was significantly associated with temporary marriage, accessing family planning services and history of working in brothels. Conversely, temporary marriage or married status, condom rupture/slippage, and HIV seropositivity remained independently significantly associated with CCU with nonpaying sex partners. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated the urgent need for scaling up condom promotion interventions catered toward FSWs and their sex partners to practice safe sex consistently.",
