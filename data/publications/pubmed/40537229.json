  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The cuff leak test (CLT) is hypothesised to help optimise extubation by assessing for laryngeal oedema which, if unrecognised and untreated, could lead to post-extubation stridor, post-extubation airway obstruction, and reintubation. However, the diagnostic accuracy of the CLT to detect post-extubation stridor (and hence potentially airway obstruction) remains uncertain. Given the equipoise that exists surrounding the CLT, we are conducting a pilot randomised clinical trial (RCT) examining the CLT as part of the pathway to extubation. Herein, we report the protocol for the Cuff Leak Test and Airway Obstruction in Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients (COSMIC): a Pilot Feasibility Randomized Clinical trial (RCT). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a multicentre, international, parallel-group, pragmatic, pilot RCT. We will enrol 100 mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are deemed ready for extubation and have at least one risk factor for laryngeal oedema. In the intervention arm, respiratory therapists will perform a qualitative CLT before extubation. If a patient passes the CLT (suggesting no laryngeal oedema), extubation will be performed in keeping with standard care. If the patient fails the CLT (suggesting laryngeal oedema), extubation will be delayed allowing for administration of dexamethasone, consideration of diuresis, and the CLT will be repeated in 12-24â€‰hours. In the control arm, patients will be extubated without completing a CLT, without steroid administration, and without delay. Randomization will be by a 1:1 allocation, stratified by centre. The primary feasibility outcomes will include recruitment and protocol adherence. Secondary outcomes will include post-extubation stridor, reintubation within 72 hours, emergency surgical airway within 72 hours, and ICU and hospital mortality within 30 days. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial has been approved by Clinical Trials Ontario, Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, State of Kuwait Ministry of Health, University of Texas Health Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects and Brant Community Health Systems Research Ethics Committee. The trial has received a No Objection Letter from Health Canada. Trial results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT05456542.",
