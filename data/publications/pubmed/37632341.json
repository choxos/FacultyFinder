  "title": "Assessing the feasibility of an intervention for adolescents and parents transitioning out of paediatric eating disorder services: A mixed methods study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a new intervention designed to support adolescents and parents in the transition from paediatric eating disorder (ED) treatment to adult mental health services. METHOD: Pre-transition adolescents with EDs, and their parents, were invited to complete up to five transition intervention components over 3 months. A mixed methods design was used to assess intervention feasibility, comprised of acceptability and preliminary effectiveness. A single-arm pre-post design was used to collect and analyse quantitative survey and feasibility data. Individual qualitative interviews and written reflections were collected and analysed using content analysis. RESULTS: This study yielded a 33% (10/31) recruitment rate and 68% (13/19) retention rate. On average, participants completed 75% of the expected components in under 3 months, with varied completion of each expected intervention component (40%-100%). Participants found the intervention convenient and helpful. Parents reported a significant decrease in guilt (Z = -2.02, p = 0.04, d = -0.83). By 1-month post-transition, three adolescents transitioned to interim supports and none started specialist adult treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although this transition intervention did not demonstrate adequate feasibility, its acceptability and effectiveness should be evaluated after an update based on participant feedback. Other solutions to bridge the transition gap for adolescents with EDs should continue to be identified. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT04888273.",
