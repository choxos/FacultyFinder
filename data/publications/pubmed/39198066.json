  "title": "A Survey of United States Transplant Center Donation After Circulatory Death Kidney Transplant Practices in the Modern Era.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The mismatch between the number of patients awaiting kidney transplantation and the supply of donor organs has contributed to the increase in kidney transplantation from donors after circulatory death (DCD). Persistently long waiting times have led the transplant community to continue to explore the use of expanded- criteria DCD kidneys. In parallel, advances in organ preservation strategies have contributed to an overall increase in DCD organ transplantation and are altering the transplant landscape. Some of these techniques may improve kidney allograft outcomes and affect how DCD kidneys are used. We aimed to better understand practices in accepting DCD kidney offers in the modern era. METHODS: Directors of 196 US kidney transplant centers were emailed a link to an online survey over a 5-week period. RESULTS: Forty-eight out of the 364 directors (13%) responded, with all United Network for Organ Sharing regions represented. Definitions of warm ischemia time (WIT) used in DCD kidney evaluation varied widely among the respondents. The maximum total WIT limit varied, with 19 (39.6%) <60-minute responses, followed by 16 (33%) <90-minute responses, and 10 (20.8%) <120-minute responses. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increasing DCD kidney transplantation volumes in the United States, there are no standardized procurement biopsy practices, organ procurement organization preoperative protocols, or consensus definition or limits of WIT. Agreement on terminology may facilitate rapid clinical communication, efficiency of organ allocation and utilization, recording of data, research, and improvements in policy.",
