  "abstract": "Aging is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, and there is no effective therapeutic approach to alleviate this condition. NF-κB and TNF-α have been implicated in the activation of the aging process, but the signaling molecules responsible for the inactivation of NF-κB and TNF-α remain unknown. Exosomes have been reported to improve heart functions by releasing miRNA. Recent studies suggest that lncRNAs are more tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific compared to miRNA. However, the role of lncRNA in exosome-mediated cardiac repair has not been explored. In the present study, we focused on metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), which is an lncRNA associated with cell senescence. We discovered that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell- (UMSC-) derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction. Silencer RNA against lncRNA MALAT1 blocked the beneficial effects of exosomes. In summary, we discovered that UMSC-derived exosomes prevent aging-induced cardiac dysfunction by releasing novel lncRNA MALAT1, which in turn inhibits the NF-κB/TNF-α signaling pathway. These findings will lead to the development of therapies that delay aging and progression of age-related diseases.",
