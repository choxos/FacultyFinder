  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe the Indiana Hemophilia and Thrombosis Center (IHTC) surgical database, its key components, and exploratory analyses of surgeries conducted between 1998 and 2019. METHODS: Surgical data across bleeding disorders collected retrospectively (1998-2006) and prospectively (2006-2019) were analyzed. Perioperative hemostasis, complications, and surgical plan deviations were compared by bleeding disorder diagnosis and data collection period. RESULTS: Within the 21-year period, 3246 procedures were conducted in 1413 patients with a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWD), hemophilia A (HA), hemophilia B (HB), and other bleeding disorders. Majority of the procedures were minor (63.3%), and median number of surgeries per patient was 1 (range: 1-22). Adequate perioperative hemostasis was achieved in 90.9%, complications occurred in 13.6%, and surgical plan deviations occurred in 31.3% of procedures. Inadequate perioperative hemostasis and surgical plan deviations occurred more frequently in procedures involving HB compared with other bleeding disorders. Complications were not significantly different across bleeding disorders (p = .164). The prospective data collection period was associated with higher rates of hemostatic efficacy (92.4% vs. 88.3%; p < .001), complications (14.3% vs. 12.3%; p < .001), and plan deviations (34.2% vs. 25.1%; p < .001). CONCLUSION: The surgical database is an important resource in surgical management in patients with bleeding disorders. Further evaluation will facilitate use for the development of predictive models and principles of care.",
