  "abstract": "Effective delivery of the bioactive protein, lactoferrin (LF), remains a challenge as it is sensitive to environmental changes and easily denatured during heating, restricting its application in functional food products. To overcome these challenges, we formulated novel polyelectrolyte ternary complexes of LF with gelatin (G) and negatively charged polysaccharides, to improve the thermal stability of LF with retained antibacterial activity. Linear, highly charged polysaccharides were able to form interpolymeric complexes with LF and G, while coacervates were formed with branched polysaccharides. A unique multiphase coacervate was observed in the gum Arabic GA-LF-G complex, where a special coacervate-in-coacervate structure was found. The ternary complexes made with GA, soy soluble polysaccharide (SSP), or high methoxyl pectin (HMP) preserved the protein structures and demonstrated enhanced thermal stability of LF. The GA-LF-G complex was especially stable with >90% retention of the native LF after treatment at 90 °C for 2 min in a water bath or at 145 °C for 30 s, while the LF control had only ~ 7% undenatured LF under both conditions. In comparison to untreated LF, LF in ternary complex retained significant antibacterial activity on both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, even after heat treatment. These ternary complexes of LF maintain the desired functionality of LF, thermal stability and antibacterial activity, in the final products. The ternary complex structure, particularly the multiphase coacervate, may serve as a template for the encapsulation and stabilization of other bioactives and peptides.",
