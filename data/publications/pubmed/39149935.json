  "title": "A Comparative Study of DC Beads, Callispheres and Multimodal Imaging Nano-Assembled Microspheres Loaded with Irinotecan in Vitro.",
  "abstract": "Introduction: In recent years, the development of drug-eluting embolization beads that can be imaged has become a hot research topic in regard to meeting clinical needs. In our previous study, we successfully developed nano-assembled microspheres (NAMs) for multimodal imaging purposes. NAMs can not only be visualized under CT/MR/Raman imaging but can also load clinically required doses of doxorubicin. It is important to systematically compare the pharmacokinetics of NAMs with those of commercially available DC Beads and CalliSpheres to evaluate the clinical application potential of NAMs. Methods: In our study, we compared NAMs with two types of drug-eluting beads (DEBs) in terms of irinotecan, drug-loading capacity, release profiles, microsphere diameter variation, and morphological characteristics. Results: Our results indicate that NAMs had an irinotecan loading capacity similar to those of DC Beads and CalliSpheres but exhibited better sustained release in vitro. Conclusion: NAMs have great potential for application in transcatheter arterial chemoembolization for the treatment of colorectal cancer liver metastases.",
