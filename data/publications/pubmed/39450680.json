  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The group of disorders known as Disorders of Gut Brain Interaction (DGBI) were originally labeled functional GI disorders and were thought to be disorders of the gastrointestinal tract that had several psychological conditions as comorbidities. Despite mounting evidence that psychological morbidity plays an innate role in the etiology and maintenance of DGBI, none of the Rome IV criteria include any measure of psychological symptoms. This study tested the hypothesis that individuals would cluster differently if GI symptoms alone were considered versus GI symptoms combined with measures of psychological symptoms. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Study measuring Rome IV GI symptoms, psychological measures and demographic characteristics. Latent profile models were used to cluster individuals based on (i) GI symptoms only (GI only) and then (ii) GI and psychological measures (GI + Psych). KEY RESULTS: Individuals clustering into the same group of individuals whether formed via GI only or GI + Psych, ranged from 96% for a 2-class solution (the most simplistic) to 76% with 6 classes (the parsimonious system) and 59% with twenty-two classes (mimicking Rome IV). The generalisability of this finding between six geographic regions was confirmed with agreement varying between 95%-97% for 2 clusters and 71-79% for 6 classes and 51%-63% for 22 classes. These findings were also consistent between DGBI (range 94% with 2 classes to 50% with 22 classes) and non-DGBI (range 97% with 2 clusters to 65% with 22 classes) groups. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Our data suggest that considering psychological as well as gastrointestinal symptoms would lead to a different clustering of individuals in more complex, and accurate, classification systems. For this reason, future work on DGBI classification should consider inclusion of psychological traits.",
