  "title": "High-resolution three‑dimensional contrast‑enhanced magnetic resonance venography in children: comparison of gadofosveset trisodium with ferumoxytol.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Gadofosveset is a gadolinium-based blood pool contrast agent that was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2008. Its unanticipated withdrawal from production in 2016 created a void in the blood pool agent inventory and highlighted the need for an alternative agent with comparable imaging properties. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to compare the diagnostic image quality, vascular contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and temporal signal characteristics of gadofosveset trisodium and ferumoxytol at similar molar doses for high-resolution, three-dimensional (3-D) magnetic resonance (MR) venography in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records and imaging data sets of patients who underwent high-resolution 3-D gadofosveset-enhanced MR venography (GE-MRV) or ferumoxytol-enhanced MR venography (FE-MRV) were retrospectively reviewed. Two groups of 20 pediatric patients (age- and weight-matched with one patient common to both groups; age range: 2 days-15 years) who underwent high-resolution 3-D GE-MRV or FE-MRV at similar molar doses were identified and analyzed. Qualitative analysis of image quality and vessel definition was performed by two blinded pediatric radiologists. Interobserver agreement was assessed with the AC1 (first-order agreement coefficient) statistic. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CNR of the inferior vena cava and aorta were measured in the steady-state venous phase. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for any adverse reactions associated with either contrast agent. RESULTS: Measured SNR and CNR of the inferior vena cava were higher for FE-MRV than GE-MRV (P = 0.034 and P < 0.001, respectively). The overall image quality score and individual vessel scores of FE-MRV were equal to or greater than GE-MRV (P = 0.084), with good interobserver agreement (AC1 = 0.657). The venous signal on FE-MRV was stable over the longest interval measured (1 h, 13 min and 46 s), whereas venous signal on GE-MRV showed more variability and earlier loss of signal. No adverse reactions were noted in any patient with either contrast agent. CONCLUSION: Ferumoxytol produces more uniform and stable enhancement throughout the entire venous circulation in children than gadofosveset, offering a wider time window for optimal image acquisition. FE-MRV offers a near-ideal approach to high-resolution venography in children at all levels of anatomical complexity.",
