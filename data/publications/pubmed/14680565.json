  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To explore the accuracy and role of magnetic resonance imagine (MRI)-guided stereotactic biopsy for atypical diseases in brain. METHODS: Using MRI volume scan and multiplane reconstruction, MRI-guided stereotactic brain biopsies were performed with CRW stereotactia frame in twenty-six patients whose lesions were atypical or unable to be detected by CT scanning. RESULTS: No serious complication (intracranial hematoma, paralysis) caused by brain biopsy was found in all twenty-six patients. Definite pathologic diagnosis and appropriate treatment were given to these patients. The lesions included gliomatosis cerebri, brain cysticercosis and Krabbe's disease, et al. CONCLUSIONS: MRI-guided stereotactic brain biopsy is more accurate for pathological diagnosis than CT-guided stereotactic brain biopsy. MRI-guided stereotactic biopsy can provide reliable diagnosis and treatment especially for the questionable lesions in brain.",
