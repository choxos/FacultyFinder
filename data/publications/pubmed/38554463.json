  "title": "Multi-interfacial bridging engineering of flexible MXene film for efficient electromagnetic shielding and energy conversion.",
  "abstract": "Accompanied by the progressive development of electronic equipment, excellent electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials display a satisfying prospect in protecting electronic devices against electromagnetic pollution/radiation, while integrating energy conversion. Heretofore, it remains a conundrum to availably construct thin films with multi-interfacial bridging engineering as multifunctional shielding devices. To effectively achieve electromagnetic wave attenuation and integrate energy conversion, a co-mixed vacuum-assisted filtration strategy is designed to synthesize Au@MXene/cellulose nanocrystal/dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid-doped polyaniline (AMCP) films. Profited from the interfacial engineering, the total EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) can be increased by 27 % with the highest value of 67.9 dB. MXene with localized surface plasmon resonance characteristics gives the composite films good energy conversion performance, that is, the composite film can be rapidly heated up to 100 °C under the irradiation of an infrared lamp, and its surface temperature remains stable after continuous irradiation. Additionally, the infrared emissivity is as low as 0.173 within the 8-14 μm, which is necessary to adapt various application scenarios. Therefore, it is reliable that the AMCP films constructed by multicomponent offer a facile strategy for MXene-based EMI shielding devices with integration characteristics.",
