  "abstract": "We report a case of torsional diplopia caused by presumed torsional anomalous retinal correspondence after myectomy of previously asymmetrically anteriorized inferior oblique muscles for inferior oblique overaction. Given this patient's experience, it may be prudent to operate with caution on previously anteriorized inferior oblique muscles, especially when anteriorization is performed at a very young age.",
