  "title": "Ultralow Threshold, Single-Mode InGaAs/GaAs Multiquantum Disk Nanowire Lasers.",
  "abstract": "We present single-mode nanowire (NW) lasers with an ultralow threshold in the near-infrared spectral range. To ensure the single-mode operation, the NW diameter and length are reduced specifically to minimize the longitudinal and transverse modes of the NW cavity. Increased optical losses and reduced gain volume by the dimension reduction are compensated by an excellent NW morphology and InGaAs/GaAs multiquantum disks. At 5 K, a threshold low as 1.6 μJ/cm[2] per pulse is achieved with a resulting quality factor exceeding 6400. By further passivating the NW with an AlGaAs shell to suppress surface nonradiative recombination, single-mode lasing operation is obtained with a threshold of only 48 μJ/cm[2] per pulse at room temperature with a high characteristic temperature of 223 K and power output of ∼0.9 μW. These single-mode, ultralow threshold, high power output NW lasers are promising for the development of near-infrared nanoscale coherent light sources for integrated photonic circuits, sensing, and spectroscopy.",
