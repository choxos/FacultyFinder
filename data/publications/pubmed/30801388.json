  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The FAITH trial evaluated effects of sliding hip screws versus cancellous screws in femoral neck fracture patients. Using FAITH trial data, we quantified changes in living status, use of aids, and investigated factors associated with living and walking independently 12 months after fracture. METHODS: We conducted a descriptive analysis to quantify patients' changes in living status, use of aids, and used multivariable Cox regression analyses to determine factors associated with living and walking independently after fracture. RESULTS: Of patients who lived independently before hip fracture, 3.07% (50-80 years old) and 19.81% (>80 years old) were institutionalized 12 months after injury. Of patients who were walking independently before injury, 33.62% (50-80 years old) and 69.34% (>80 years old) required a walking aid 12 months after injury. Factors associated with higher chances of living independently included the following: being between 50 and 80 years, having a class I American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, not using a walking aid before fracture, being a nonsmoker or former smoker, and having an acceptable quality of implant placement. Factors associated with higher chances of walking without an aid included the following: being between 50 and 80 years, having a class I American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, living independently before fracture, being a nonsmoker or former smoker, having an undisplaced fracture, and not requiring revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Femoral neck fracture patients suffer great losses of independence. Identifying factors associated with living and walking independently after hip fracture may help surgeons better identify which patients are at risk and optimize care of patients with this injury. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Prognostic Level II. See Instructions for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.",
