  "title": "Virtual Trions in the Photoluminescence of Monolayer Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides.",
  "abstract": "Photoluminescence experiments from monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides often show that the binding energy of trions is conspicuously similar to the energy of optical phonons. This enigmatic coincidence calls into question whether phonons are involved in the radiative recombination process. We address this problem, unraveling an intriguing optical transition mechanism. Its initial state is a localized charge (electron or hole) and delocalized exciton. The final state is the localized charge, phonon, and photon. In between, the intermediate state of the system is a virtual trion formed when the localized charge captures the exciton through emission of the phonon. We analyze the difference between radiative recombinations that involve real and virtual trions (i.e., with and without a phonon), providing useful ways to distinguish between the two in experiment.",
