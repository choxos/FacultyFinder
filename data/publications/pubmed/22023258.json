  "title": "Insight into the biomarkers as the novel anti-psoriatic drug discovery tool: a contemporary viewpoint.",
  "abstract": "Psoriasis is a common chronic autoimmune skin disorder with T-cell mediated multifunctional complex pathogenesis along with genetic predisposition. Conventionally, many therapies are available for the management of psoriasis, but they have limited efficacy due to higher side effects. Over the last decade, one of the major efforts in psoriasis research has been made for the development of drug molecules by understanding the potential biomolecules/biomarkers associated with psoriasis. This approach aims to provide selective immunologically directed intervention with fewer side effects than conventional therapies. The present review aims to give an exhaustive account on various biomarkers including oxidative stress, peptide, biochemical and gene markers responsible for keratocyte hyper proliferation, inflammatory responses and abnormal differentiation in psoriasis. Effective targeting of these over expressed biomarkers can serve as the novel tool for anti-psoriatic drug development. In addition, this review also gives insights into several novel biomarkers targeted drugs under pre-clinical and clinical investigation or have been registered by FDA for psoriasis management.",
