  "title": "Prolonged low-dose methylprednisolone treatment is highly effective in reducing duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality in patients with ARDS.",
  "abstract": "An updated meta-analysis incorporating nine randomized trials (n = 816) investigating low-to-moderate dose prolonged glucocorticoid treatment in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) show moderate-to-high quality evidence that glucocorticoid therapy is safe and reduces (i) time to endotracheal extubation, (ii) duration of hospitalization, and (iii) mortality (number to treat to save one life = 7), and increases the number of days free from (i) mechanical ventilation, (ii) intensive care unit stay, and (iii) hospitalization. Recent guideline suggests administering methylprednisolone in patients with early moderate-to-severe (1 mg/kg/day) and late persistent (2 mg/kg/day) ARDS (conditional recommendation based on moderate quality of evidence).",
