  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the financial characteristics and level of satisfaction of physicians practicing in Lebanon. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, interviewer-administered phone survey of physicians practicing medicine in Lebanon. We conducted both descriptive and regression analyses. RESULTS: Of 778 invited physicians, 546 participated in the survey (70% response rate). Their mean age was 47.4 and they were predominantly male (85.9%) and married (87.0%). Reported monthly income varied widely with 47.2% earning less than US$ 2,000, 46.3% earning between $ 2,000 and $ 6,000 and 6.3% earning more than $ 6,000. Only 14.2%, 4.1%, and 3.1% respectively reported having life insurance, disability insurance and a retirement plan. A quarter of participants reported being either somewhat unsatisfied (17.6%) or very unsatisfied (8.1%) with their medical career. A lower degree of satisfaction in professional career was independently associated with female physicians, graduation from a Western European medical school and a lower monthly income. As for the perception of own career's future, 36.7% thought there was no possibility of improvement. CONCLUSION: About half of physicians practicing in Lebanon report earning less than US$ 2,000 per month and about a quarter are not satisfied with their professional career.",
