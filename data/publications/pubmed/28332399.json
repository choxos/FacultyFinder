  "title": "Modification of Molecular Conductance by in Situ Deprotection of Thiol-Based Porphyrin.",
  "abstract": "Acetylthio-protected free base porphyrins are used to form scanning tunneling microscope-molecular break junctions. The porphyrin molecules are deprotected in situ, before the self-assembly. Two types of molecular junctions are formed in the junctions: Au-S-Por-SAc-Au and Au-S-Por-S-Au. Lower conductance values and higher conductance values are observed. Computational modeling attributes the lower conductance to the Au-S-Por-SAc-Au junctions and the higher conductance to the Au-S-Por-S-Au junctions. First-principles calculation suggests that the reduced conductance in the protected porphyrin originates from the presence of the acetyl end groups (-COCH3), rather than from the elongation of the sulfur-gold (S-Au) bonds at the tip-molecule interface.",
