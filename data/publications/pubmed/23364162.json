  "title": "Portal vein thrombosis: a clinician-oriented and practical review.",
  "abstract": "With advances in modern imaging techniques, portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is being increasingly diagnosed. It has a wide ranging clinical spectrum from being an asymptomatic state to a potentially life-threatening situation. It is not unusual to find it as an incidental finding in the abdominal imagings done for other reasons. It is commonly associated with cirrhosis and abdominal malignancies and also has a strong association with prothrombotic disorders. It is often difficult for the clinicians to decide whether PVT is acute or chronic. This poses great challenges to its management strategies that include anticoagulants, thrombolysis, and surgical options. Timely diagnosis and appropriate management have great bearings on its outcomes of morbidity and mortality. In this clinician-oriented review, we have provided a concise review of clinical aspects of PVT and discussed various management strategies while addressing the common questions that come to a physician's mind dealing with such a patient.",
