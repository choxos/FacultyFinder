  "abstract": "Nonsteroidal antiinf lammatory drugs (NSAIDs) remain the mainstay of the pharmacologic management for relieving osteoarthritis pain, and low-dose aspirin is often prescribed to osteoarthritis patients who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We conducted cohort studies using data from The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database (2000-2019) to assess whether the relationship of initiation of naproxen or ibuprofen vs. initiation of other NSAIDs (excluding both naproxen and ibuprofen), respectively, to the risk of CVD was modified by coprescription of low-dose aspirin among the participants with osteoarthritis. Among participants without coprescription of aspirin, the risk of CVD was lower in naproxen initiators (10.3/1000 person-years) than in other NSAIDs initiators (13.2/1000 person-years; hazard ratio = 0.71, 95% confidence interval: 0.60, 0.85). Among participants with coprescription of aspirin, however, the risk of CVD was higher among naproxen initiators (36.9/1000 person-years) than that among other NSAIDs initiators (34.8/1000 person-years; hazard ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.12, 1.84). The association was significantly modified by coprescription of aspirin (P < 0.001). Similar findings were observed in the association of initiation of ibuprofen vs. other NSAIDs with the risk of CVD, which was significantly modified by coprescription of aspirin (P < 0.001). These findings suggest that osteoarthritis patients and clinicians should be aware of the potential CVD risk of concurrently taking naproxen or ibuprofen and low-dose aspirin.",
