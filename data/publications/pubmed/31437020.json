  "title": "Trends in Survival Based on Treatment Modality in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients: A Population-Based Study.",
  "abstract": "Objectives: We examined the trends in survival based on treatment modality among non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients in the province of Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2015. Methods: We investigated the trends in survival based on treatment modality. Results: Among 56,417 identified patients, the mean age at diagnosis was 70.1 years (SD = 10.7). Treatment modalities varied significantly over time (p<.001). Overall, 23.0% of patients received surgical treatments. We observed more than 20% increase in five-year survival rates for all surgical groups over time. Conclusions: Patients undergoing sublobar/lobar resections had higher survival rate.",
