  "title": "Hybrid spectral micro-CT: system design, implementation, and preliminary results.",
  "abstract": "Spectral CT has proven an important development in biomedical imaging, and there have been several publications in the past years demonstrating its merits in pre-clinical and clinical applications. In 2012, Xu reported that near-term implementation of spectral micro-CT could be enhanced by a hybrid architecture: a narrow-beam spectral “interior” imaging chain integrated with a traditional wide-beam “global” imaging chain. This hybrid integration coupled with compressive sensing (CS)-based interior tomography demonstrated promising results for improved contrast resolution, and decreased system cost and radiation dose. The motivation for the current study is implementation and evaluation of the hybrid architecture with a first-of-its-kind hybrid spectral micro-CT system. Preliminary results confirm improvements in both contrast and spatial resolution. This technology is shown to merit further investigation and potential application in future spectral CT scanner design.",
