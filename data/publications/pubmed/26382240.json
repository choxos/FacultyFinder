  "title": "Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitor Dialyzability and Outcomes in Older Patients Receiving Hemodialysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Some angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are efficiently removed from circulation by hemodialysis ('high dialyzability'), whereas others are not ('low dialyzability'). In patients receiving hemodialysis, this may influence the effectiveness of ACE inhibitors. METHODS: Using linked healthcare databases we identified older patients receiving chronic hemodialysis who filled new ACE inhibitor prescriptions. The low dialyzability group (n = 3,369) included fosinopril and ramipril. The high dialyzability group (n = 5,974) included enalapril, lisinopril, and perindopril. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 180 days of first ACE inhibitor prescription. RESULTS: There were 361 deaths among 5,974 patients (6.0%) prescribed with low dialyzability ACE inhibitors and 179 deaths among 3,369 patients (5.3%) prescribed with high dialyzability ACE inhibitors (relative risk 1.1, 95% CI 0.9-1.3, p = 0.6). CONCLUSION: In this study of older patients receiving hemodialysis, the dialyzability of ACE inhibitors was not associated with mortality or cardiovascular outcomes.",
