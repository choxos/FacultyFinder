  "abstract": "The presence of diesel in the water could reduce the growth of plant and thus phytoremediation efficacy. The toxicity of diesel to plant is commonly explained; because of hydrocarbons in diesel accumulate in various parts of plants, where they disrupt the plant cell especially, the epidemis, leaves, stem and roots of the plant. This study investigated the effect of bacterial augmentation in floating treatment wetlands (FTWs) on remediation of diesel oil contaminated water. A helophytic plant, Phragmites australis (P. australis), was vegetated on a floating mat to establish FTWs for the remediation of diesel (1%, w/v) contaminated water. The FTWs was inoculated with three bacterial strains (Acinetobacter sp. BRRH61, Bacillus megaterium RGR14 and Acinetobacter iwoffii AKR1), possessing hydrocarbon degradation and plant growth-enhancing capabilities. It was observed that the FTWs efficiently removed hydrocarbons from water, and bacterial inoculation further enhanced its hydrocarbons degradation efficacy. Diesel contaminated water samples collected after fifteen days of time interval for three months and were analyzed for pollution parameters. The maximum reduction in hydrocarbons (95.8%), chemical oxygen demand (98.6%), biochemical oxygen demand (97.7%), total organic carbon (95.2%), phenol (98.9%) and toxicity was examined when both plant and bacteria were employed in combination. Likewise, an increase in plant growth was seen in the presence of bacteria. The inoculated bacteria showed persistence in the water, root and shoot of P. australis. The study concluded that the augmentation of hydrocarbons degrading bacteria in FTWs is a better option for treatment of diesel polluted water.",
