  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To quantify the frequency and impact of malnutrition in systemic sclerosis (SSc), as diagnosed by the Global Leadership Initiative on Malnutrition (GLIM) criteria, based on weight loss, BMI and muscle atrophy. METHODS: Australian Scleroderma Cohort Study participants meeting ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc with ≥1 concurrent weight and height measurement were included. The chi-squared test, two-sample t-test or Wilcoxon's rank-sum test was used for between-group comparison as appropriate. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to establish the determinants of malnutrition diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models were used for survival analyses, based on malnutrition diagnosis, and individual GLIM criteria (percentage weight loss, BMI thresholds and presence of muscle atrophy). RESULTS: In this study of 1903 participants, 43% were diagnosed with malnutrition according to GLIM criteria, of whom 33% had severe malnutrition. Participants diagnosed with malnutrition were older, and more likely to have diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), higher SSc severity scores and RNA polymerase-3 positivity. Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement, multimorbidity, cardiopulmonary disease, raised inflammatory markers, hypoalbuminaemia and anaemia were more common in malnourished participants (P < 0.01). Multimorbidity (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 2.0; P < 0.01), pulmonary arterial hypertension (OR 2.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 2.0; P < 0.01) and upper GI symptoms (OR 1.6; 95% CI: 1.3, 2.0; P < 0.01) were all associated with malnutrition. Health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) and physical function were poorer in malnourished participants. Survival was worse in those with malnutrition after adjusting for age, sex and dcSSc (hazard ratio 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1, 1.7; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Malnutrition is common in SSc and confers poorer survival, HRQoL and physical function.",
