  "title": "Evaluating compliance of extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis following abdominopelvic surgery for cancer: A multidisciplinary quality improvement project.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Despite quality evidence supporting postoperative extended venous thromboembolism prophylaxis (eVTEp) following abdominopelvic cancer surgery, baseline use of eVTEp at our institution was 3%. Our project aim was to improve the proportion of patients prescribed eVTEp following surgery for gynecologic, hepatobiliary, and colorectal cancers by a 30% absolute increase. METHODS: We performed an interrupted time series study using quality improvement methodology. Postoperative order sets, pre-printed prescriptions, process checklists, and multimodal education were introduced. Process and outcome data were collected and analyzed on statistical process control charts. RESULTS: We included 324 patients with gynecologic and hepatobiliary cancers. Despite efforts to include them, the colorectal team did not participate. The monthly mean order set-use was 58% (SD = 14%), by specialty: gynecology 79%, hepatobiliary 47%. The proportion of patients prescribed eVTEp increased from 3% to 70% (SD = 14%). The target goal was surpassed and sustained by both cohorts. Patient compliance was 73% (n = 117/160, SD = 16%). Of those who stopped eVTEp early, 45% (n = 14/31) objected because of the injectable nature. Bleeding events were infrequent (0.6%, n = 2/324). CONCLUSIONS: Three process changes and multimodal education resulted in a significant increase in eVTEp use. Failure to identify improvement champions limited project expansion to colorectal patients. Patient compliance was largely limited by the injectable nature of the medication.",
