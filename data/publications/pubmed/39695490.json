  "title": "The generic version of China Health Related Outcomes Measures (CHROME-G): psychometric testing and comparative performance with the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 among the Chinese general population.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The CHROME-G is the first generic preference-based measure developed in China. This study aimed to validate and compare the psychometric properties of the CHROME-G with the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 among the Chinese general population. METHODS: A representative sample of the Chinese general population in terms of age, gender, education, and urban/rural residence was recruited for an online survey. During the survey, respondents completed three instruments (first the CHROME-G, then the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 in random order), demographic and health-related questions. The retest survey was carried out after two weeks. Ceiling/floor effects were first assessed. Convergent and divergent validity was examined using Spearman's rank correlation. Known-group validity was examined using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test and effect size. Test-retest reliability was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient and weighted Kappa statistics. RESULTS: One thousand respondents (51.1% male, mean age 44.7 years) completed the first survey, with 378 also completing the retest survey. The mean ± SD completion time was 2.03 ± 0.58 min for the CHROME-G, and 1.37 ± 0.54 and 1.13 ± 0.38 min for the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2. Only the EQ-5D-5L had a ceiling effect of 35.1%. The range of Spearman rank's correlations was 0.45-0.62 for convergent validity and 0.14-0.46 for divergent validity. Among different health subgroups, the effect size for the CHROME-G, EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2 was 1.348-3.416, 1.362-3.325 and 1.097-2.228, respectively. The ICC for test-retest was 0.791 for the CHROME-G, compared with 0.994 and 0.971 for the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2. CONCLUSIONS: The CHROME-G showed good and comparable psychometric properties with the EQ-5D-5L and SF-6Dv2.",
