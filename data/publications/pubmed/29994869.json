  "title": "Securing the Appendiceal Stump During Emergency Appendicectomy: Options and Influencing Factors in Current UK Surgical Practice.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to identify the most commonly employed methods and influencing factors for securing the appendiceal stump in current NHS practice. METHODS: An electronic survey of the Scottish Surgical Research Group network, invitation extended to the UK National Research Collaborative. RESULTS: A total of 111 responses were received from 32 surgical centers; 28 (25.2%) consultants, 66 (59.5%) specialty trainees and 12 (10.8%) core trainees. Endoscopic ligatures were the preferred method in 96 (86.5%) with no difference in those with the greatest operative experience (P=0.79), 12 (10.8%) preferred polymeric clips. Ease of application (70.3%) and severity of stump inflammation (65.8%) had the greatest influence on the method chosen. Cost was a factor in 36.0%. CONCLUSIONS: The preferred method for securing the appendiceal stump in UK practice is endoscopic ligatures regardless of operative experience. Factors with the greatest influence on the method employed include the ease of application and severity of stump inflammation. Our findings are likely to be representative of current NHS practice in Scotland.",
