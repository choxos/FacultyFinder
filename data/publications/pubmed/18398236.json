  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and timing of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and unbound free fatty acid (FFAu) elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 55 patients undergoing PCI within 1 hour prior to PCI, immediately after PCI, 6 hours and 18-24 hours after PCI, and were analyzed for BNP and FFAu. RESULTS: There was a trend toward a rise in BNP levels at 18-24 hours post-PCI (65 vs. 45 pg/ml; p = 0.056). FFAu levels rose immediately after PCI and returned to baseline by 6 hours postprocedure (2.0 nM pre-PCI, 6.4 nM immediately post-PCI, 1.9 nM 6 hours post-PCI, and 2.2 nM 18-24 hours post-PCI; p < 0.0001). BNP and FFAu levels were elevated post-PCI in 17% and 82% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: PCI using short inflation times and coronary stenting are associated with a trend toward increased BNP levels at 18-24 hours post-PCI and a transient significant rise in FFAu levels.",
