  "title": "Outcomes of Hypoparathyroidism in Pregnancy: An Observational Study from a Tertiary Canadian Centre.",
  "abstract": "This study provides an analysis of maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies complicated by hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT), drawing data from a tertiary Canadian referral centre. This retrospective review identifies key differences in pregnancy outcomes, particularly a higher cesarean delivery rate in women with HypoPT compared to the Canadian national average. The study underscores the necessity for meticulous antenatal care, particularly in managing maternal serum calcium levels and tailoring medication adjustments to mitigate adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. The findings suggest that nonsurgical HypoPT compared to postsurgical HypoPT presents a greater risk for preterm delivery and neonatal hypocalcemia, requiring neonatal intensive care unit admission. Postsurgical HypoPT was associated with a higher cesarean delivery rate and postpartum hypercalcemia, particularly in breastfeeding women.",
