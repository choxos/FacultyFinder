  "title": "How To Read a Network Meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "Network meta-analysis (NMA) expands upon traditional meta-analysis by integrating three or more interventions. This allows comparing interventions using evidence from trials that have compared pairs of interventions directly, and indirect evidence through common comparators. We provide an overview of NMA concepts and considerations when interpreting results from a systematic review with a NMA and applying them to clinical practice. PATIENT SUMMARY: Network meta-analysis is a statistical tool that allows researchers to compare multiple treatments for a medical condition at once, even when treatments have not been compared to each other in research studies. This mini-review explains how to read a network meta-analysis and apply its results in patient care.",
