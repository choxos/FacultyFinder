  "abstract": "Fluorometric competing-ligand titrations were used to measure stability constants of Zn(II), Cd(II) and Cu(I) complexes of cysteine and glutathione (GSH). Cu(I)-stability constants were also determined for the dipeptides Arg-Cys and Gln-Cys which are produced by a marine alga under copper stress. The fluorescent ion indicators FluoZin-1 and BTC (Invitrogen) were used as competing ligands in titrations involving Zn(II) and Cd(II). Phen Green SK (Invitrogen) was likewise used in Cu(I) titrations. Conditional and cumulative general stability constants were determined using a least squares fit of the titration data to speciation models. The measured stability constants of Cd(II) and Zn(II) complexes were consistent with previous work, validating our method and assumptions. Our results also include the first general stability constants for Cu(I)-cysteine complexes and an alternative set for Cu(I)-GSH complexes. While these stability constants indicate that Cu(I) forms strong complexes with thiols, they are not strong enough to effectively buffer Cu(I) in seawater.",
