  "title": "Plasma Exchange for ANCA-Associated Vasculitis: An International Survey of Patient Preferences.",
  "abstract": "RATIONALE & OBJECTIVE: We sought to elicit patient preferences regarding the use of plasma exchange in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) and its tradeoffs of risk of kidney failure and risk of serious infection. STUDY DESIGN: Patient survey. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: The online survey was circulated to adults with AAV via kidney and vasculitis networks in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. OUTCOMES: Respondents reviewed the estimated 1-year risks of kidney failure and serious infection in AAV with and without plasma exchange across 5 serum creatinine categories (150, 250, 350, 450, and 600 μmol/L). For each scenario, participants indicated whether or not they would choose plasma exchange. ANALYTICAL APPROACH: Responses were assessed with multilevel multivariable logistic regression models to identify predictors of respondent choice regarding treatment with plasma exchange. RESULTS: The 470 respondents from the 13 countries (United States 61.7%, United Kingdom 20.0%, Canada 13.8%, and other countries 4.5%) had a mean age of 58.6 (SD 14.3) years, 70.2% women. Respondents were more likely to choose plasma exchange in scenarios at high risk of kidney failure and serious infection (creatinine level of 350 or 450 μmol/L) compared with lower risk scenarios or the highest risk scenario. However, 145 (30.9%) chose plasma exchange across all scenarios, whereas 80 (17.0%) declined plasma exchange across all scenarios. Respondents from the United Kingdom (OR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.09-6.22) who received previous dialysis (OR, 2.70; 95% CI, 1.12-6.52) or received previous plasma exchange (OR, 5.62; 95% CI, 2.72-11.61) were more likely to choose plasma exchange, whereas older respondents (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99 per 1 year increase) were less likely. LIMITATIONS: Unclear generalizability to non-English-speaking, older, and less health literate adults, possible responder bias, survivor bias, lack of individualized risk assessments for kidney failure, and serious infection. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AAV do not express a consistent choice for plasma exchange, which highlights the need for shared decision making.",
