  "title": "Lingual frenotomy for ankyloglossia in infants with breastfeeding difficulties: a longitudinal observational study.",
  "abstract": "Ankyloglossia, or tongue-tie, is a variation in the anatomy of the lingual frenulum that restricts tongue movement. It is recognised as a cause of breastfeeding difficulty. We prospectively collected data from a specialist tongue-tie assessment clinic and evaluated mothers' experience using a questionnaire. We prospectively collected data from the specialist tongue-tie assessment clinic from January 2023 to October 2023 to assess factors that may influence a lingual frenotomy in an infant. Mothers were invited to complete two questionnaires, one baseline in the clinic waiting room and one follow-up, 4 weeks after their clinic visit. These self-reported questionnaires assessed breastfeeding challenges, the mother's motivation for seeking an opinion regarding ankyloglossia, and the continuity of breastfeeding 4 weeks following the clinic visit. During these 10 months, 157 infants attended the clinic, and 96 frenotomies were performed. One hundred one participants completed baseline questionnaires, and 34 participants completed follow-up questionnaires. When mothers were asked why they wanted their baby assessed for a tongue-tie, the most common answers were difficulty with latch and nipple pain, reported by 45% and 40%, respectively. The average reported pain while breastfeeding was scored at 2.53, graded from 0 to 5 in the baseline questionnaire. This improved to 1.47 amongst women whose infants had a frenotomy. Conclusion: Our study suggests that performing a frenotomy in infants diagnosed with ankyloglossia may positively impact breastfeeding.",
