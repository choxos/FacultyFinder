  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Health care professionals use measures of pain and impairment to identify potential disability and subsequently to predict workers' ability to do their work. However, there is little evidence that measures used are associated with ability to do one's job. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted. Nurses (n = 100) were classified into either off/modified work (due to LBP) or regular work groups. Trunk ROM, trunk muscular endurance, pain and disability were measured relative to the outcomes work status and Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ) score. RESULTS: Regression analyses which included Roland Morris Questionnaire (RMQ, disability) and Sørenson (back extensor endurance) in the final models correctly classified the work status of 87% of the participants and accounted for 60% of variance in the WLQ score. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the RMQ and Sørenson test as diagnostic and prognostic tools should be considered in assisting return to work and treatment decision-making in female nurses with LBP.",
