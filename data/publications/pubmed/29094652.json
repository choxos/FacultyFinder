  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study underscores the importance of the survivor/parent dynamic in understanding the knowledge level of childhood cancer survivors and their parents with regard to cancer diagnosis, treatments, and potential late effects, and to assess the impact of parental knowledge on survivor's knowledge. PROCEDURE: A convenience sample (N = 219 dyads) consisting of childhood cancer survivors with a parent match was used. Survivors 2 years out from completion of therapy, aged 16 to 25 years, and fluent in English or Spanish completed 2 questionnaires to assess adolescent and young adult and parental knowledge regarding diagnosis, treatment, and long-term risks. RESULTS: Data from the survivor/parent dyad confirm that parents are more knowledgeable than their child regarding treatment specifics. However, survivors are more accurate when assessing second tumor and fertility risk. More knowledgeable parents led to more knowledgeable survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Although parents were well-informed about treatment specifics, they were not as accurate in identifying risks appropriately. Therefore, education must be directed at both parent and survivors to maximize knowledge.",
