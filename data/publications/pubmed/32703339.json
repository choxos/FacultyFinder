  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and association of Glutathione S-Transferase Theta 1 and Glutathione S-Transferase Mu 1 null genotypes in development of actinic keratosis (AK) in a group of Pakistani population. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control analytical study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Department of Biochemistry, Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi in collaboration with Department of Dermatology, Railway Hospital and Rural Health Center, District Health Office, Rawalpindi from September 2018 to September 2019.  Methodology: A total of 86 participants were included in this study with 27 biopsy proven cases of AK and 59 matched controls. Blood samples were collected after obtaining written informed consent; and DNA was extracted by Chelex™ method. Multiplex PCR (M-PCR) was done to find respective allelic frequencies of GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes in both cases and controls.  Results: Mean age of participants in cases and controls was 62.93 ±10.29 years and was 61.42 ±9.96 years, respectively. There were 18 males (66.7%) and 9 females (33.3%); and 43 males (72.9%) and 16 females (27.1%) in cases and controls, respectively. There was a significant association of GSTT1 null genotype with AK (OR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.05-7.05, p = 0.037). There was a positive correlation between GSTT1 null genotype and AK (r = 0.225, p = 0.037). CONCLUSION: GSTT1 null genotype has a significant association for AK development in the studied Pakistani population.
