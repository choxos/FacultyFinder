  "title": "Patient Income Does Not Predict Disability or Mortality in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients in a Large Health Care System in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.",
  "abstract": "Race, income, and their role in COVID-19 infection in the community have been extensively reported, but their impact on outcomes in hospitalized patients is less well defined. We retrospectively analyzed the first 509 COVID-19 patients in our hospital network, examining associations between median household income, 30-day mortality, and ambulatory state at discharge (using the modified Rankin scale (mRS)), adjusting for hospitalization at the academic medical center (AMC) and other variables. Income did not predict mortality. Higher income was associated with slightly increased odds of ability to ambulate at discharge only when accounting for hospital type. At the AMC, income and mortality were lower and functional outcomes more favorable. Patients with lower incomes had greater comorbidity burden. That income was not associated with measures of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 is a remarkable and encouraging finding. Academic medical centers may mitigate detrimental effects of socioeconomic disparities on COVID-19 seen at the community level.",
