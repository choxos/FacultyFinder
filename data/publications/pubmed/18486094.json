  "title": "Reproductive factors associated with nocturia and urinary urgency in women: a population-based study in Finland.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the association of nocturia and urinary urgency with reproductive factors, including parity, the postpartum period, the menopause, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, and surgery for stress urinary incontinence (SUI). STUDY DESIGN: In 2003-2004, questionnaires eliciting urinary symptoms, reproductive factors, SUI surgery, and potential confounders were mailed to 3000 randomly selected women aged 18-79 years, identified from the Finnish Population Register. Nocturia was defined as 2 or more voids/night. Sudden compelling desire to urinate often or always (scale of never, rarely, often, always) was regarded as urgency. Pregnant and puerperal (6 weeks after delivery) women and those reporting urinary tract infection were excluded. RESULTS: Responses totaled 2002 (67%). Parity, postpartum (defined as six weeks to one year after delivery) and postmenopausal periods were associated with increased nocturia and SUI surgery with increased urgency (adjusted for age, comorbidity, medication, anthropometric, sociodemographic and lifestyle factors). Hormone therapy and hysterectomy were associated with neither symptom. CONCLUSION: Reproductive factors associated with nocturia differed from those related to urgency.",
