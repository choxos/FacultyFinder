  "title": "Association between pregnancy planning or intention and early child development: A systematic scoping review.",
  "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals have a specific target to \"ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development\" by 2030. There is sparse literature regarding the impact of pregnancy intention (wantedness and timing) or planning on child development. We aimed to summarize the evidence measuring the association between unintended or unplanned pregnancy and child development for children aged 3 to 5. We included studies that compared developmental outcomes of children from unwanted, unplanned, or mistimed pregnancies to those of children from wanted or planned pregnancies. In April 2022, we searched Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and SCOPUS (from inception) without language restrictions. One reviewer tabulated data on country and year of study, population, sample and sampling method, age of participants, exposure, date of exposure retrieval, developmental outcome(s), assessment (direct or through third parties), statistical methods (including covariate selection methods), and effect estimates into bespoken data tables. Our scoping review identified 12 published studies reporting on 8 \"cohorts\" (range: 1963-2016) with information on approximately 39,000 children born mostly in developed countries. Overall, unwanted/unplanned pregnancies seemed to be associated with poorer child development when compared with wanted/planned pregnancies. Mistimed or delayed pregnancies correlated with weaker effects in the same direction. We concluded that achieving the target for SDG 4, related to child development, might entail policies that create environments supportive of wanted conception and access to safe abortion.",
