  "title": "Polygenic risk scores for eGFR are associated with age at kidney failure.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The genetic architecture of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is complex, including monogenic and polygenic contributions. CKD progression to kidney failure is influenced by factors including male sex, baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), hypertension, diabetes, proteinuria, and the underlying kidney disease. These traits all have strong genetic components, which can be partially quantified using polygenic risk scores. This paper examines the association between polygenic risk scores for CKD-related traits and age at kidney failure development. METHODS: Genome-wide genotype data from 10,586 patients with kidney failure were compiled from 12 cohorts. Polygenic risk scores for hypertension, albuminuria, rapid decline in eGFR, decreased total kidney volume, and decreased eGFR were calculated using weights from published independent population-scale genome-wide association studies. The association between each polygenic risk score and age at kidney failure was investigated using logistic regression models. The association between polygenic risk score and age at kidney failure was also investigated separately for each primary kidney disease. RESULTS: Individuals in the highest 10% of polygenic risk score for decreased eGFR developed kidney failure 2 years earlier than those in the bottom 90% (49.9 years and 47.9 years, P = 5e-5). A standard deviation increase in decreased eGFR polygenic risk score was associated with increased odds of developing kidney failure before the age of 60 years (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.05; 95% CI 1.01-1.10; P = 0.01), as was high decreased eGFR polygenic risk score (OR = 1.26; 95% CI 1.08-1.46; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that decreased eGFR polygenic risk score explains a portion of the variation in age at development of kidney failure.",
