  "abstract": "Bombyx mori silk fibroin is a protein-based macromolecular biopolymer with remarkable biocompatibility. Silk fiber was degummed and subjected to a series of treatments, including dissolution and dialysis, to yield an aqueous solution of silk fibroin, which was introduced rapidly into excess acetone to produce crystalline silk fibroin nanoparticles (SFNs). The SFNs were conjugated covalently with a neutral protease (NP) using glutaraldehyde as the cross-linking reagent. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal conditions for biosynthesis of the SFN-NP bioconjugates. First, SFN-NP was obtained by covalent cross-linking of SFN and NP at an SFN/NP ratio of 5-8 mg:1 IU with 0.75% glutaraldehyde for 6 h at 25 °C. When adding 50 IU of the enzyme, the residual activity of biological conjugates was increased to 31.45%. Studies on the enzyme activity of SFN-NP and its kinetics showed that the stability of SFN-NP bioconjugates was greater than that of the free enzyme, the optimum reactive temperature range was increased by 5-10 °C, and the optimum pH value range was increased to 6.5-8.0. Furthermore, the thermal stability was improved to some extent. A controlled hydrolysis test using the poorly water-soluble protein sericin as a substrate and SFN-NP as the enzyme showed that the longer the reaction time (within 1 h), the smaller the molecular mass (<30 kDa) is of the sericin peptide produced. The SFN-NP bioconjugate is easily recovered by centrifugation and can be used repeatedly. The highly efficient processing technology and the use of SFN as a novel vector for a protease has great potential for research and the development of food processing.",
