  "title": "Anxiety in children with epilepsy.",
  "abstract": "Although the prevalence is unknown, affective disorders are more common in children with epilepsy than in healthy controls. The purpose of the present study was to examine the occurrence of anxiety in children and adolescents with epilepsy and to determine factors associated with elevation of these symptoms. Children and adolescents (n=101) between the ages of 6 and 16 years were given the Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety were reported by 23% of the patients. Based on regression analysis, factors significantly associated with increased anxiety included the presence of comorbid learning or behavioral difficulties, ethnicity, and polytherapy. Results suggest the need to monitor children and adolescents with epilepsy for affective symptoms in order to provide appropriate interventions.",
