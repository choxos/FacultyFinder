  "abstract": "The periampullary neuroendocrine tumour is an infrequently occurring tumour. Its prevalence among gastrointestinal neuroendocrine neoplasms is less than 0.3%, and less than 2% out of periampullary tumours. These neoplasms have relatively poor prognosis. Jaundice and pain in the abdomen are the early and most commonly occurring symptoms with weight loss being a late event. The carcinoid syndrome presents infrequently in periampullary neuroendocrine tumour and happens only if hepatic metastasis occurs. In this scenario, histopathology plays a paramount role in the diagnosis. Specific immunohistochemical staining is used for diagnosis while the treatment options are local excision, endoscopic excision and pancreaticoduodenectomy. Here is a case report of a 42-year-old patient who presented with complaint of obstructive jaundice for one month. Periampullary carcinoid tumour was diagnosed on biopsy, and she underwent Pancreaticoduodenectomy as treatment. Literature shows that there is poor precision of preoperative and intraoperative lymph node metastatic involvement regardless of the size of the tumour. Hence, radical resection must be considered the standard approach.",
