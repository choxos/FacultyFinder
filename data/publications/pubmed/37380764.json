  "title": "GDF15 promotes weight loss by enhancing energy expenditure in muscle.",
  "abstract": "Caloric restriction that promotes weight loss is an effective strategy for treating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and improving insulin sensitivity in people with type 2 diabetes[1]. Despite its effectiveness, in most individuals, weight loss is usually not maintained partly due to physiological adaptations that suppress energy expenditure, a process known as adaptive thermogenesis, the mechanistic underpinnings of which are unclear[2,3]. Treatment of rodents fed a high-fat diet with recombinant growth differentiating factor 15 (GDF15) reduces obesity and improves glycaemic control through glial-cell-derived neurotrophic factor family receptor α-like (GFRAL)-dependent suppression of food intake[4-7]. Here we find that, in addition to suppressing appetite, GDF15 counteracts compensatory reductions in energy expenditure, eliciting greater weight loss and reductions in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) compared to caloric restriction alone. This effect of GDF15 to maintain energy expenditure during calorie restriction requires a GFRAL-β-adrenergic-dependent signalling axis that increases fatty acid oxidation and calcium futile cycling in the skeletal muscle of mice. These data indicate that therapeutic targeting of the GDF15-GFRAL pathway may be useful for maintaining energy expenditure in skeletal muscle during caloric restriction.",
