  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared clinical characteristics, echocardiographic parameters, exercise capacity, and quality of life between women and men with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). METHODS AND RESULTS: Subjects in the NIH-sponsored RELAX (N = 216) and NEAT (N = 107) trials completed baseline echocardiography, the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire (MLHFQ), and 6-minute walk test (6MWT). In an exploratory analysis, multivariable linear regression models were used to associate clinical and imaging characteristics with baseline 6MWT distance and MLHFQ score in women and men. Our cohort included 158 (49%) men and 165 (51%) women. Men had higher prevalence of atrial arrhythmias, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, anemia, and left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy. 6MWT and MLHFQ score did not differ between sexes. In multivariable analysis, ischemic heart disease, diastolic dysfunction, and exercise capacity predicted MLHFQ score for men, whereas only age and body mass index predicted MLHFQ score for women. CONCLUSIONS: Men with HFpEF had more comorbidities and LV hypertrophy than women with HFpEF. In men, quality of life was associated with diastolic dysfunction, ischemic heart disease, and exercise capacity. Further research is needed to identify determinants of quality of life in women with HFpEF.",
