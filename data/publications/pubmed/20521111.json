  "title": "IgG4-related sclerosing disease: a novel mimic of inflammatory bowel disease.",
  "abstract": "High levels of IgG4-positive plasma cells are commonly seen in autoimmune pancreatitis. It has recently become evident that autoimmune pancreatitis is one component of a larger multi-system disease. IgG4-positive plasma cells have been identified in many extrapancreatic tissues, including the colon, biliary tract, liver, and lungs, and thus the term \"IgG4-related sclerosing disease\" has been proposed. Awareness of IgG4-related sclerosing disease is important, as it has been shown to mimic other conditions like malignancy. This review discusses IgG4-related colitis and its potential for mimicking inflammatory bowel disease.",
