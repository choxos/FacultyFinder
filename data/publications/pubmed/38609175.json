  "title": "Long-term neuropsychiatric complications of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a narrative review.",
  "abstract": "This review focuses on the often-neglected long-term neuropsychiatric consequences of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), beyond traditional randomized trial outcomes of mortality and retreatment. While current guidelines recommend screening for these sequalae, it may not be routinely practiced. This review will underscore the prevalence and management of common neuropsychiatric sequalae, including anxiety, depression, cognitive dysfunction, headaches, seizures, and sexual dysfunction, all of which can significantly impact the quality of life of survivors of aSAH. We emphasize the critical role neurointerventionalists can play by going beyond the customary practice of radiological monitoring for treated aneurysms by screening for and helping guide management of these common neuropsychiatric complications.",
