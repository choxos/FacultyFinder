  "abstract": "Most medical schools attempt to select applicants on the basis of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Typically, interpersonal skills are assessed by interview, though relatively few applicants make it to interview. Thus, an efficient paper and pencil test of non-cognitive skills is needed. One possibility is personality tests. Tests of the five factor model of personality, and in particular the factor of conscientiousness, has proven effective in predicting future job performance. Can it serve as a screen for admissions interviews? In particular, correlation with the multiple mini-interviews (MMI) is of interest since the latter is a well validated test of non-cognitive skills. A total of 152 applicants to Michael G. DeGroote School of Medicine at McMaster completed the Neo-5 personality test voluntarily in advance of their admissions interviews. Correlations were calculated between personality factors and grade point average (GPA), medical college admissions test (MCAT) and MMI. No statistically significant correlation was found between personality factors and cognitive (GPA, MCAT) measures. More surprisingly, no statistically significant correlation was found between personality factors, including conscientiousness, and the MMI. Personality testing is not a useful screening test for the MMI.",
