  "title": "Role of platelet rich plasma mediated repair and regeneration of cell in early stage of cardiac injury.",
  "abstract": "Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a widely accepted treatment approach and has heightened the quality of care among physicians. PRP has been used over the last decade to boost clinical results of plastic therapies, periodontal surgery and intra-bony defects. According to certain research, elevated levels of PRP growth factors that could promote tissue repair and have the potential for PRP to be beneficial in regenerating processes that Maxillofacial and Oral Surgeons, Veterinary Officers, Athletic medicine specialists and Dermatologists have long admired. PRP is an autologous whole blood fraction that has a heavy amount of a variety of growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF-b), insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) which can facilitate repair and regeneration. Moreover, a clinical trial of PRP in severe angina patients has shown its excellent safety profile. However, PRP is a very complex biological substance with an array of active biomolecules, its functions are yet to be fully clarified. In-addition, there was insufficient work assessing possible cardiovascular tissue benefits from PRP. Thus, it still remains necessary to identify the most clinically important cardiovascular applications and further research in clinical scenario need to be validated.",
