  "title": "Molecular Approaches in HFpEF: MicroRNAs and iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes.",
  "abstract": "Heart failure with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (HFpEF) has emerged as one of the largest unmet needs in cardiovascular medicine. HFpEF is increasing in prevalence and causes significant morbidity, mortality, and health care resource utilization. Patients have multiple co-morbidities which contribute to the disease complexity. To date, no effective treatment for HFpEF has been identified. The paucity of cardiac biopsies from this patient population and the absence of well-accepted animal models limit our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of HFpEF. In this review, we discuss combining state-of-the-art technologies of microRNA profiling and human induced pluripotent cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) in order to uncover novel molecular pathways that may contribute to the development of HFpEF. Here, we focus the advantages and limitations of microRNA profiling and iPSC-CMs as a disease model system to discover molecular mechanisms in HFpEF.",
