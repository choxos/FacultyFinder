  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop guidance for authors of diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) reviews to help them write a plain language summary of the results of their review. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We used a combination of focus groups, user testing, and a web-based survey. Participants included patient representatives, media representatives, and health professionals. RESULTS: We present step-by-step guidance for authors of DTA reviews for writing a plain language summary. This guidance is illustrated with examples of reader-tested sentences, explanations, and a figure. CONCLUSION: We hope this guidance will allow reviewers to present the findings of DTA reviews so that it is easier for readers to understand the results and conclusions. This will increase the accessibility of these reviews for various audiences.",
