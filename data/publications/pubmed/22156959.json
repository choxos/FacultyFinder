  "title": "Selective inhibition of intra-alveolar p55 TNF receptor attenuates ventilator-induced lung injury.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is upregulated in the alveolar space early in the course of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Studies in genetically modified mice indicate that the two TNF receptors play opposing roles during injurious high-stretch mechanical ventilation, with p55 promoting but p75 preventing pulmonary oedema. AIM: To investigate the effects of selective inhibition of intra-alveolar p55 TNF receptor on pulmonary oedema and inflammation during ventilator-induced lung injury using a newly developed domain antibody. METHODS: Anaesthetised mice were ventilated with high tidal volume and given an intratracheal bolus of p55-specific domain antibody or anti-TNF monoclonal antibody ('pure' VILI model). As a model of enhanced inflammation, a subclinical dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was included in the intratracheal antibody bolus (LPS+VILI model). Development of lung injury was assessed by respiratory mechanics and blood gases and protein levels in lavage fluid. Flow cytometry was used to determine leucocyte recruitment and alveolar macrophage activation, while lavage fluid cytokines were assessed by ELISA. RESULTS: The ventilation protocol produced deteriorations in respiratory mechanics and gas exchange with increased lavage fluid protein levels in the two models. The p55-specific domain antibody substantially attenuated all of these changes in the 'pure' VILI model, while anti-TNF antibody was ineffective. In the LPS+VILI model, p55 blockade prevented deteriorations in respiratory mechanics and oxygenation and significantly decreased neutrophil recruitment, expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on alveolar macrophages, and interleukin 6 and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 levels in lavage fluid. CONCLUSIONS: Selective inhibition of intra-alveolar p55 TNF receptor signalling by domain antibodies may open new therapeutic approaches for ventilated patients with acute lung injury.",
