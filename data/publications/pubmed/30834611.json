  "title": "How to implant a phrenic nerve stimulator for treatment of central sleep apnea?",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Central sleep apnea (CSA) is a breathing disorder caused by the intermittent absence of central respiratory drive. Transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation is a new therapeutic option, recently approved by the FDA , for the treatment of CSA. OBJECTIVE: To describe the technique used to implant the transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation system (the remedē System, Respicardia, Inc). METHODS: The remedē System is placed in the pectoral region, typically on the right side. A single stimulation lead is placed in either the left pericardiophrenic vein (PPV) or the right brachiocephalic vein (RBC). A sensing lead is placed into the azygous vein to detect respiration. RESULTS: In the remedē System Pivotal trial, 147 of 151 (97%) patients were successfully implanted with the system. Sixty-two percent of stimulation leads were placed in the PPV and 35% in the RBC. Mean procedure time was 2.7 ± 0.8 hours and 94% of patients were free from implant-related serious adverse events through 6 months. CONCLUSION: In patients with CSA, transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation is an effective and safe therapy with an implant procedure similar to that of cardiac implantable electronic devices.",
