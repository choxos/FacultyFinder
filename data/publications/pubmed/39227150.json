  "title": "Determinants of nonphysical intimate partner violence: a cross-sectional study with nationally representative data from Canada.",
  "abstract": "Based on a nationally representative survey of the Canadian population conducted in 2019/2020, this study examined the prevalence and determinants of nonphysical intimate partner violence (NP-IPV). NP-IPV was defined as experiences of emotional abuse, controlling behaviors, or economic abuse during the past 5 years. Women (17.3%) and men (16.9%) were equally likely to report NP-IPV, often without co-occurring physical/sexual IPV. For both genders, the risk of NP-IPV decreased with age and increased with financial strain and having a disability. Childhood maltreatment (sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and exposure to emotional IPV for women and sexual abuse and emotional abuse for men) was associated with an increased likelihood of reporting NP-IPV in adulthood. Other risk factors included heavy episodic drinking (self and/or spouse/partner) for women and living in a neighborhood with high levels of social disorder for men. Having confidence in the police was a protective factor for both genders. These associations generally persisted in regression analyses controlling for co-occurring physical/sexual IPV. Future research should focus on methods of preventing NP-IPV and the development of gender-specific interventions to reach and support those who experience NP-IPV. Furthermore, there is a need to improve and standardize measures of NP-IPV.",
