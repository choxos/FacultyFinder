  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Latino patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) face cultural and language barriers leading to poor outcomes. Shared medical appointments (SMAs) are recognized as effective models of care. Our aim is to develop a culturally sensitive, cost effective SMA program for Latino T1D. SUBJECTS: Spanish speaking Latinos 1 to 20 years with T1D (n = 88) and their families. METHODS: Routine care alternating with SMAs that included group education was provided. Teens, ages >11 received the SMA separate from parents. Younger children were seen together. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), behavioral questionnaires, and use of diabetes technology were measured at baseline and every 3 to 6 months. RESULTS: 57.7% of children and 77.27% of teens completed the 2 years of the Program. There was a significant association between age and change in HbA1c from baseline to year 1 (P = .001) and baseline to year 2 (P = <.0001). For participants <12 years, there was a significant improvement in HbA1c from baseline to year 1 (P = .0146) and from year 1 to year 2 (P = .0069). Participants ≥12 years, had an increase in HbA1c from year 1 to year 2 (P = .0082). Technology use increased significantly from baseline to year 2 for participants <12 years of age (19%-60%, P = .0455) and for participants who were ≥12 years of age (10%-23%, P = .0027). Participants reported a 98% satisfaction rate. CONCLUSIONS: The culturally sensitive SMA proved to be an appreciated, feasible, and effective alternative to care for Latinos with T1D.",
