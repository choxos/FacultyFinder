  "abstract": "• In situations of emergencies and urgencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, many are disseminating information through social media channels; this has an impact on billions of persons worldwide. • Misinformation about the current pandemic occurs frequently in these platforms and can have serious consequences. • When properly used, social media can be a useful tool that provides opportunities to disseminate and receive relevant information for patients, clinicians, and scientists. • Better research methods and proper use of these platforms by health scientists and the public are warranted to address social media's role in health policy and individual decisions. A multidisciplinary approach with better outreach and dissemination is optimal.",
