  "title": "Factors associated with internal hip rotation gait in patients with cerebral palsy.",
  "abstract": "Internal rotation gait is common in children with cerebral palsy. Factors thought to contribute include femoral anteversion, hip flexor tightness, imbalance of hip rotators, and hamstring and adductor tightness. The exact cause of internal rotation must be defined before contemplating surgery. We investigated the prevalence of internal hip rotation and associated factors, which are considered to influence this walking pattern, in patients with cerebral palsy. Gait laboratory data of 222 patients with cerebral palsy were studied retrospectively. Two groups were selected; those with maximum dynamic hip internal rotation of more than 27 degrees and those with less than 20 degrees. Of 222 patients, 27.0% (diplegia, 61.7%; hemiplegia, 38.3%) had at least one hip with dynamic internal rotation of more than 27 degrees. This study suggests that dynamic hip internal rotation is multifactorial in origin. The most significant differences in clinical measures were found in values of passive hip external rotation range, femoral anteversion and hip flexor contracture. We discuss the role of early treatment of hip flexion contracture.",
