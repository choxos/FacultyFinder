  "title": "Non-Invasive Biomarkers in Saliva and Eye Infrared Thermography to Assess the Stress Response of Calves during Transport.",
  "abstract": "Animal transport is currently a stressful procedure. Therefore, animal-based indicators are needed for reliable and non-invasive welfare assessment. Saliva is a biospecimen with potential validity for the determination of cortisol and oxidative stress, although its use to assess calf welfare during transport has never been tested. Similarly, the applicability and reliability of infrared thermography to assess temperature change during calves' transport have never been evaluated. These objectives were outlined following the known and growing need to identify non-invasive methodologies for stress assessment in bovines. This study was conducted on 20 calves of the Arouquesa autochthone breed, at about nine months of age, during their transport to slaughter. For each animal, saliva samples and thermographic images of the eye were collected at three time points: before transport, after transport, and at slaughter. The saliva was then processed to measure cortisol levels and oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, carbonyls, and advanced oxidation protein products), and the images were analyzed using FLIR Tools+ software. There was an increase in cortisol concentration and oxidative stress parameters (reactive oxygen species, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance, carbonyls, and advanced oxidation protein products) in saliva after transport. An increase in eye temperature triggered by transport was also observed. The cortisol and eye temperature results at slaughter were returned to values similar to those before transport; however, the values of oxidative stress remained increased (mainly TBARS values). These non-invasive techniques seem to be reliable indicators of stress in bovine transport, and oxidative stress parameters in saliva may be a persistent marker for welfare assessment.",
