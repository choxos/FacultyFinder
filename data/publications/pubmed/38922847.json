  "title": "The contribution of NaV1.6 to the efficacy of voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitors in wild type and NaV1.6 gain-of-function (GOF) mouse seizure control.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Inhibitors of voltage-gated sodium channels (NaVs) are important anti-epileptic drugs, but the contribution of specific channel isoforms is unknown since available inhibitors are non-selective. We aimed to create novel, isoform selective inhibitors of Nav channels as a means of informing the development of improved antiseizure drugs. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We created a series of compounds with diverse selectivity profiles enabling block of NaV1.6 alone or together with NaV1.2. These novel NaV inhibitors were evaluated for their ability to inhibit electrically evoked seizures in mice with a heterozygous gain-of-function mutation (N1768D/+) in Scn8a (encoding NaV1.6) and in wild-type mice. KEY RESULTS: Pharmacologic inhibition of NaV1.6 in Scn8a[N1768D/+] mice prevented seizures evoked by a 6-Hz shock. Inhibitors were also effective in a direct current maximal electroshock seizure assay in wild-type mice. NaV1.6 inhibition correlated with efficacy in both models, even without inhibition of other CNS NaV isoforms. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our data suggest NaV1.6 inhibition is a driver of efficacy for NaV inhibitor anti-seizure medicines. Sparing the NaV1.1 channels of inhibitory interneurons did not compromise efficacy. Selective NaV1.6 inhibitors may provide targeted therapies for human Scn8a developmental and epileptic encephalopathies and improved treatments for idiopathic epilepsies.",
