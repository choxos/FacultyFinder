  "title": "Prevalence of ultrasound-detected knee synovial abnormalities in a middle-aged and older general population-the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is paucity of data on the prevalence of ultrasound-detected synovial abnormalities in the general population, and the relationship between synovial changes and knee pain remains unclear. We examined the prevalence of synovial abnormalities on ultrasound and the relationship of these features with knee pain and radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) in a community sample. METHODS: Participants aged 50 years or over were from the Xiangya Osteoarthritis Study, a community-based cohort study. Participants were questioned about chronic knee pain and underwent (1) ultrasonography of both knees to determine presence of synovial hypertrophy (≥ 4 mm), effusion (≥ 4 mm), and Power Doppler signal [PDS; yes/no]; and (2) standard radiographs of both knees (tibiofemoral and patellofemoral views) to determine ROA. RESULTS: There were 3755 participants (mean age 64.4 years; women 57.4%). The prevalence of synovial hypertrophy, effusion, and PDS were 18.1% (men 20.2%; women 16.5%), 46.6% (men 49.9%; women 44.2%), and 4.9% (men 4.9%; women 5.0%), respectively, and increased with age (P for trend < 0.05). Synovial abnormalities were associated with knee pain, with adjusted odds ratios (aORs) of 2.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.00-2.86) for synovial hypertrophy, 1.58 (95%CI 1.39-1.80) for effusion, and 4.36 (95%CI 3.09-6.17) for PDS. Similar associations with ROA were observed, the corresponding aORs being 4.03 (95%CI 3.38-4.82), 2.01 (95%CI 1.76-2.29), and 6.49 (95%CI 4.51-9.35), respectively. The associations between synovial hypertrophy and effusion with knee pain were more pronounced among knees with ROA than those without ROA, and the corresponding P for interaction were 0.004 and 0.067, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Knee synovial hypertrophy and effusion are more common and increase with age, affecting men more than women. All three ultrasound-detected synovial abnormalities associate both with knee pain and ROA, and knee synovial hypertrophy or effusion and ROA may interact to increase the risk of knee pain.",
