  "title": "Preconditioning program reduces the incidence of prolonged hospital stay after lung cancer surgery: Results from the Move For Surgery randomized clinical trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lung cancer resection is associated with high rates of prolonged hospital stay. It is presumed that preconditioning with aerobic exercise can shorten the postoperative duration of hospital stay, but this has not yet been demonstrated in trials after lung cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to perform a RCT to determine whether Move For Surgery (MFS), a home-based and wearable technology-enhanced preconditioning program before lung cancer surgery, is associated with a lower incidence of prolonged hospital stay when compared to usual preoperative care. METHODS: Patients undergoing lung resection for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled before surgery into this blinded, single-site RCT, and randomized to either the MFS or control group in a 1 : 1 ratio. Patients in the MFS group were given a wearable activity tracker, and education about deep breathing exercises, nutrition, sleep hygiene, and smoking cessation. Participants were motivated/encouraged to reach incrementally increasing fitness goals remotely. Patients in the control group received usual preoperative care. The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients with hospital stay lasting more than 5 days between the MFS and control groups. RESULTS: Of 117 patients screened, 102 (87.2 per cent) were eligible, enrolled, and randomized (51 per trial arm). The majority (95 of 102, 93.1 per cent) completed the trial. Mean(s.d.) age was 67.2(8.8) years and there were 55 women (58 per cent). Type of surgery and rates of thoracotomy were not different between arms. The proportion of patients with duration of hospital stay over 5 days was 3 of 45 (7 per cent) in the MFS arm compared to 12 of 50 (24 per cent) in the control arm (P = 0.021). CONCLUSION: MFS, a home-based and wearable technology-enhanced preconditioning program before lung cancer surgery, decreased the proportion of patients with a prolonged hospital stay.
