  "title": "Effect of vasopressin on hemodynamics in patients with refractory cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction.",
  "abstract": "In a retrospective study of 36 patients who developed cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction, intravenous vasopressin therapy increased mean arterial pressure from 56 to 73 mm Hg at 1 hour (p < 0.001) and maintained it for 24 hours without changing pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, cardiac index, urine output, or other inotropic requirements. After norepinephrine administration, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased at 1 hour from 21 to 24 mm Hg (p = 0.04); however, this increase was not sustained at 12 and 24 hours. Norepinephrine was associated with a significant increase in cardiac power index at 24 hours, whereas there was only a trend for an increase in cardiac power with vasopressin therapy. In a cohort of patients who developed refractory cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction, vasopressin was associated with increased mean arterial pressure and no adverse effect on other hemodynamic parameters.",
