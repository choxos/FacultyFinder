  "title": "Risk factors and their diagnostic values for ocular metastases in invasive ductal carcinoma.",
  "abstract": "Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is a major type of breast cancer. Ocular metastasis (OM) in IDC is rarely seen, but patients with OM often have a poor prognosis. Furthermore, OM is difficult to detect in the early stages by common imaging examinations. In the present study, we tried to figure out the risk factors of OM in IDC and evaluate their diagnostic values for early detection. There were 1192 IDC patients who were divided into two groups according to ocular metastasis involved in this study. Clinical parameters of those patients were used to detect differences. The binary logistic regression test was then used to determine the risk factors of OM in IDC. Furthermore, ROC curves of both single and combined risk factors were established to examine their diagnostic values. The incidence of axillary lymph node metastases was significantly higher in the OM group (p = 0.002). Higher carbohydrate antigen 153 (CA153), lower apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1), and hemoglobin (Hb) were risk factors for OM in IDC (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.038, respectively). In the single risk factor ROC analysis, cutoff values of CA153, ApoA1, and Hb were 43.3 u/mL (CI: 0.966-0.984, p < 0.001), 1.11 g/L (CI: 0.923-0.951, p < 0.001), and 112 g/L (CI: 0.815-0.857, p < 0.001), respectively. Among the ROC curves of combined risk factors, CA153+ApoA1+Hb had the best accuracy, with the sensitivity and specificity of 89.47% and 99.32%, respectively (CI: 0.964-0.983, p < 0.001). CA153, ApoA1, and Hb are risk factors for OM in IDC. In clinical practice, the three parameters could be used as predictive factors for the early detection of OM.",
