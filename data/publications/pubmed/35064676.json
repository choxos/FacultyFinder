  "title": "Immune response to COVID-19 vaccination is attenuated by poor disease control and antimyeloma therapy with vaccine driven divergent T-cell response.",
  "abstract": "Myeloma patients frequently respond poorly to bacterial and viral vaccination. A few studies have reported poor humoral immune responses in myeloma patients to COVID-19 vaccination. Using a prospective study of myeloma patients in the UK Rudy study cohort, we assessed humoral and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) cellular immune responses to COVID-19 vaccination post second COVID-19 vaccine administration. We report data from 214 adults with myeloma (n = 204) or smouldering myeloma (n = 10) who provided blood samples at least three weeks after second vaccine dose. Positive Anti-spike antibody levels (> 50 iu/ml) were detected in 189/203 (92.7%), positive IGRA responses were seen in 97/158 (61.4%) myeloma patients. Only 10/158 (6.3%) patients were identified to have both a negative IGRA and negative anti-spike protein antibody response. In all, 95/158 (60.1%) patients produced positive results for both anti-spike protein serology and IGRA. After adjusting for disease severity and myeloma therapy, poor humoral immune response was predicted by male gender. Predictors of poor IGRA included anti-CD38/anti-BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen) therapy and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccination. Further work is required to understand the clinical significance of divergent cellular response to vaccination.",
