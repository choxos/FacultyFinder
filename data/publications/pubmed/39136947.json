  "title": "Patient-Reported Outcome Measures in Cancer Care: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) come directly from the patient, without clinician interpretation, to provide a patient-centered perspective. OBJECTIVE: To understand the association of PROM integration into cancer care with patient-related, therapy-related, and health care utilization outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Searches included MEDLINE and MEDLINE Epub ahead of print, in-process, and other nonindexed citations; Embase databases (OvidSP); PsychINFO; CENTRAL; and CINAHL from January 1, 2012 to September 26, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that enrolled adult patients (ages 18 years and older) with active cancer receiving anticancer therapy using a PROM as an intervention. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pairs of review authors, using prepiloted forms, independently extracted trial characteristics, disease characteristics, and intervention details. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses reporting guideline was followed. Random-effects analyses were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Overall mortality, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) measures, and hospital utilization outcomes. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2022, 45 RCTs including 13â€¯661 participants addressed the association of PROMs with outcomes considered important to patients. The addition of a PROM likely reduced the risk of overall mortality (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.72-0.98; moderate certainty), improved HRQoL (range 0-100) at 12 weeks (mean difference [MD], 2.45; 95% CI, 0.42-4.48; moderate certainty). Improvements of HRQoL at 24 weeks were not significant (MD, 1.87; 95% CI, -1.21 to 4.96; low certainty). There was no association between the addition of a PROM and HRQoL at 48 weeks. The addition of a PROM was not associated with reduced ED visits (OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-1.02; low certainty) or hospital admissions (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.73-1.02; low certainty). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that the integration of PROMs into cancer care may improve overall survival and quality of life.",
