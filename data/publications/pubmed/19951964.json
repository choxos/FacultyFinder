  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To perform a systematic review, supplemented by a targeted grey literature scan, for performance measurement and improvement frameworks within and across the health, education and social service systems. The intended outcome was the creation of a foundation of evidence to inform the development of cross-sectoral quality improvement frameworks. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE, Social Services Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts and Education Index Full Text were searched up to April/May 2007. In addition, 26 governmental and 27 organizational websites were searched. STUDY SELECTION: English language material with a publication date of 1986 or more recent that described a health, education or social services multidimensional framework for performance measurement and improvement. Data extraction The framework name; administrative sector; level of application; setting; population of interest; categories of quality described within the framework; country of application; and citations to other performance measurement and improvement frameworks were extracted from each article. RESULTS: In total, 111 frameworks were identified. Most frameworks (n = 97) were developed in or for the health sector. A concept sorting exercise identified 16 quality concepts applicable across many settings, sectors and levels of application. CONCLUSION: This systematic review of quality domains will be relevant and useful to those who are developing and using performance measurement and improvement frameworks for adult and child populations within or across the health, social service or education sectors.",
