  "title": "Genotoxic potential of a novel PDE-4B inhibitor Apremilast by chromosomal aberration and micronucleus assay in mice.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Researchers have confirmed that chronic administration of drugs at high doses causes genotoxicity which serve as first step in development of cancers. Apremilast, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drug for Psoriatic Arthritis. The present study designed to conduct genotoxicity testing using the genotoxic study which give simple, sensitive, economical and fast tools for the assessment of damage of genetic material. METHODS: To conduct genotoxicity study of Apremilast, 60 Swiss albino male mice divided into 6 groups (n = 10). Group1 served as a normal control group without any treatment, Group 2 treated as a disease control and administered with cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg, IP. Group 3, 4, 5 and 6 treated as test groups and received 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg/kg/day Apremilast respectively. The total duration of study was 13 weeks. At termination day animals were sacrificed and chromosomal aberration assay (BMCAA) and micronucleus assay (BMMNA) were performed to know the genotoxicity potential of Apremilast. RESULTS: The results indicates significant rise in chromosomal aberrations (CA) frequency in bone marrow cells and decrease in the MI of the disease control animals as well as Apremilast treated groups. Further significant (p < 0.001; p < 0.0001) increase in score of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) and percentage of micronucleated PCEs per 1000 PCEs and decrease in the ratio of polychromatic/normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) was observed in micronucleus assay. Genotoxic effect increases with the increase of Apremilast dose. Conclusion: Finding of present indicates that Apremilast shows genotoxic potential on high administration although further detailed toxicity studies required for confirmations.",
