  "title": "Health care reform through the eyes of patients: a qualitative look at Medicaid redesign.",
  "abstract": "This research examines consumer choice in Medicaid insurance plans. As part of the 2005 Federal Deficit Reduction Act, a number of states have implemented new Medicaid programs targeted to a subset of the Medicaid population. These programs offer consumers a choice of plans and this research examines consumer choice in one state's program. As part of a broader survey, participants were given the opportunity to explain, in their own words, why they selected their plan. We systematically interpret this qualitative data and then develop a series of propositions relating to Medicaid health care plan choice and marketing/public policy issues surrounding this choice.",
