  "title": "Mantle Cell Lymphoma Presenting with Cutaneous Lesions: A Rare Manifestation of a Systemic Disease.",
  "abstract": "Cutaneous lymphoma is a broad term used to describe any type of lymphoma involving the skin. They may be primary, arising in the skin, or secondary, resulting from spread of a systemic lymphoma. Cutaneous involvement of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is extremely rare and most often occurs secondarily. To date, less than 100 cases of MCL involving the skin have been described in the English literature. We describe a case of MCL involving the skin as the clinical presentation of disease in a 74-year-old man and highlight the radiographic and pathologic findings, treatment course, and prognosis.",
