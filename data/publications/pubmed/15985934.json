  "title": "A public health response to a cluster of suicidal behaviors: clinical psychiatry, prevention, and community health.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To develop and implement a community public health response to a suicidal behavior cluster, including collection of risk factor data in order to prevent further behaviors. METHODS: A three-phase response, including school-wide educational debriefings, individual screening for referrals, and on-site crisis management, was implemented. Incidence of suicidal behaviors and their association with hypothesized risk factors were measured. RESULTS: Thirty-three percent of students were screened. Depression and poor social functioning were associated with an increased risk of suicidal ideation. Poor social functioning and school adjustment were associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts. CONCLUSIONS: Development and implementation of a timely public health response, including elucidation of critical risk factors, might prevent further suicidal behaviors.",
