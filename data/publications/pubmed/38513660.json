  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Neurosyphilis is increasing in prevalence but its pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. This study assessed for CNS-specific immune responses during neurosyphilis compared to syphilis without neurosyphilis and compared these immune profiles to those observed in other neuroinflammatory diseases. METHODS: Participants with syphilis were categorized as having neurosyphilis if their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test was reactive and as having syphilis without neurosyphilis if they had a non-reactive CSF-VDRL test and a white blood cell count <5/Î¼L. Neurosyphilis and syphilis without neurosyphilis participants were matched by rapid plasma reagin titer and HIV status. CSF and plasma were assayed for markers of neuronal injury and glial and immune cell activation. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed on CSF cells, with results stratified by the presence of neurological symptoms. FINDINGS: CSF neopterin and five CSF chemokines had levels significantly higher in individuals with neurosyphilis compared to those with syphilis without neurosyphilis, but no markers of neuronal injury or astrocyte activation were significantly elevated. The CSF transcriptome in neurosyphilis was characterized by genes involved in microglial activation and lipid metabolism and did not differ in asymptomatic versus symptomatic neurosyphilis cases. CONCLUSIONS: The CNS immune response observed in neurosyphilis was comparable to other neuroinflammatory diseases and was present in individuals with neurosyphilis regardless of neurological symptoms, yet there was minimal evidence for neuronal or astrocyte injury. These findings support the need for larger studies of the CSF inflammatory response in asymptomatic neurosyphilis. FUNDING: This work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, grants K23MH118999 (S.F.F.) and R01NS082120 (C.M.M.).",
