  "title": "Video directly observed therapy to improve adherence of human immunodeficiency virus infected adolescents to combination antiretroviral therapy: a proof-of-concept study.",
  "abstract": "Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a major challenge for many youth living with HIV (YLWH). In this prospective proof-of-concept study, we assessed the feasibility and acceptability of conducting a study of video directly observed therapy (VDOT) as a method of improving medication adherence in YLWH who had a history of poor adherence to ART. The study had four phases; phase I - VDOT daily (4 months) using Facetime[Â®]; phase II - daily texting (2 months); phase III - weekly texting (3 months); phase IV - no intervention (3 months). Participants were seen in clinic on a monthly basis for assessment and laboratory evaluation. Five of eight eligible participants were enrolled. All achieved virologic suppression one month after enrollment. Three of five completed the study protocol and maintained virologic suppression through the 12-month period of study. Participant responses to the end-of-study questionnaire indicated satisfaction with the intervention and thought VDOT was helpful to them. Healthcare providers thought that the intervention was effective for some youth but was at times burdensome. This proof-of-concept study demonstrated that VDOT may be effective at improving medication adherence in previously poorly adherent YLWH and that larger studies of VDOT for such patients are both feasible and warranted.",
