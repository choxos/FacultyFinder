  "title": "Obesity, Cancer, and Risk Reduction with Bariatric Surgery.",
  "abstract": "The prevalence of noncommunicable diseases has increased dramatically in North America and throughout the world and is expected to continue increasing in coming years. Obesity has been linked to several types of cancers and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality following cancer diagnosis. Bariatric surgery has emerged as the prominent model to evaluate the effects of intentional weight loss on cancer incidence and outcomes. Current literature, comprising prospective cohort investigations, indicates site-specific reductions in cancer risk with select bariatric procedures. Future research is required to establish evidence-based indications for bariatric surgery in the context of cancer prevention.",
