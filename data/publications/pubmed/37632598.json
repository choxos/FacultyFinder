  "title": "Physiologically based pharmacokinetic model to predict drug-drug interactions with the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin.",
  "abstract": "Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) comprised of a Nectin-4-directed antibody and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), which is primarily eliminated through P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated excretion and cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4)-mediated metabolism. A physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to predict effects of combined P-gp with CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer (ketoconazole/rifampin) on MMAE exposure when coadministered with enfortumab vedotin and study enfortumab vedotin with CYP3A4 (midazolam) and P-gp (digoxin) substrate exposure. A PBPK model was built for enfortumab vedotin and unconjugated MMAE using the PBPK simulator ADC module. A similar model was developed with brentuximab vedotin, an ADC with the same valine-citrulline-MMAE linker as enfortumab vedotin, for MMAE drug-drug interaction (DDI) verification using clinical data. The DDI simulation predicted a less-than-2-fold increase in MMAE exposure with enfortumab vedotin plus ketoconazole (MMAE geometric mean ratio [GMR] for maximum concentration [Cmax], 1.15; GMR for area under the time-concentration curve from time 0 to last quantifiable concentration [AUClast], 1.38). Decreased MMAE exposure above 50% but below 80% was observed with enfortumab vedotin plus rifampin (MMAE GMR Cmax, 0.72; GMR AUClast, 0.47). No effect of enfortumab vedotin on midazolam or digoxin systemic exposure was predicted. Results suggest that combination enfortumab vedotin, P-gp, and a CYP3A4 inhibitor may result in increased MMAE exposure and patients should be monitored for potential adverse effects. Combination P-gp and a CYP3A4 inducer may result in decreased MMAE exposure. No exposure change is expected for CYP3A4 or P-gp substrates when combined with enfortumab vedotin.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier Not applicable.",
