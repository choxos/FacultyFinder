  "title": "Identifying the effects of using integrated haptic feedback for gait rehabilitation of stroke patients.",
  "abstract": "This paper evaluates the prospects of using a novel Integrated Haptic Feedback (IHF) system. IHF can provide over-ground gait training regimens for post-stroke ambulatory subjects. IHF system combines the use of a portable cane for kinesthetic feedback and a wearable vibrotactor array for tactile feedback. Continuous somatosensory input is aiforded to the users at the handle of cane; it serves the purpose of balance assurance at higher gait speeds. Besides, restricted use of upper limb for weight-bearing inspires the users to involve the paretic lower limbs more actively. Furthermore, tactile feedback contributes in enhancing the gait symmetry through afferent signal of vibration. Six post-stroke ambulatory individuals participated in walking trials to identity the effects of IHF system. Results indicate that while walking faster patients' body sway was not disturbed. Statistically significant increase was observed in temporal stance symmetry (p-value=0.02) and in paretic muscle (vastus medialis obliquus and semitendinosus) activation during stance phase (p-value<0.01). The IHF system can be a valuable tool to assist physical therapist in gait rehabilitation of post-stroke individuals.",
