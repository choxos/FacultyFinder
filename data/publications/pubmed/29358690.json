  "title": "Radiographic Knee Osteoarthritis and Knee Pain: Cross-sectional study from Five Different Racial/Ethnic Populations.",
  "abstract": "The weak correlation between pain and structural changes in knee osteoarthritis is widely reported. In a previous within-person, knee-matched case-control study among Caucasians, the severity of radiographic osteoarthritis (ROA) was strongly associated with both the presence of frequent knee pain and pain severity. We studied the association between ROA and knee pain in five racial/ethnic populations by using the same method. Subjects were selected from China; Japan; Korea and the United States. Among subjects with knees discordant for either frequent knee pain or pain severity, we examined the relationship between ROA and the presence of frequent knee pain using conditional logistic regression, and between ROA and pain severity using a stratified proportional odds model with an amalgamating conditional likelihood. In total, 252 urban Chinese, 221 rural Chinese, 297 Japanese, 122 Korean, 1,735 Caucasian, and 394 African-American patients were included. There was a strong dose-response relationship between the severity of ROA and the prevalence of frequent knee pain in all five racial/ethnic populations. Even mild ROA was significantly associated with frequent knee pain. In addition, ROA was also strongly associated with the severity of knee pain. These results show that structural pathology is associated with knee pain in different ethnic populations.",
