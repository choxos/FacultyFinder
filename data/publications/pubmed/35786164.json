  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aims of this study were to describe how and why adults with CP living in the UK and Ireland accessed and used physiotherapy services; to describe the type of physiotherapy accessed and satisfaction with physiotherapy services and to examine the associations between relevant factors. METHODS: A cross-sectional semi-structured online survey was employed. Participants were adults with CP aged 18 and above living in the UK and Ireland; able to complete an online questionnaire in English independently or with technical or physical assistance. Data were collected from April 2019 to February 2020. RESULTS: Participants (n = 162) were aged 18-74 years. The majority were female (75%) and lived in the UK (83%). Ninety percent of participants reported a need for physiotherapy but only 35% received physiotherapy services. The most common reason for visiting physiotherapy was mobility decline (62%). Satisfaction with the availability and quality of physiotherapy services were 21% and 27%, respectively. Adults with scoliosis and mobility decline were less likely to report that they received the physiotherapy they needed. CONCLUSION: Adults with CP did not receive the physiotherapy services that they perceived they needed. There is a need to develop physiotherapy services in collaboration with people living with CP.Implications of rehabilitationAdults with cerebral palsy (CP) needed physiotherapy services, but were not receiving the physiotherapy services that they perceive they needed.Adults were not satisfied with the availability or quality of physiotherapy services received.Adults with scoliosis and mobility decline were less likely to report that they received the physiotherapy they needed.There is a need to develop physiotherapy services from a life-span perspective for adults living with CP.",
