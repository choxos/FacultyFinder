  "abstract": "The Orthopaedic In-Training Examination (OITE) is a tool used by residency directors to evaluate a resident's fund of orthopedic knowledge. In this study, we correlated resident study habits and preparation tools with performance on the OITE. Data analysis indicated statistically significant correlations between successful OITE performance and frequent review of current orthopedic journals (Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery-American Edition, r = .6, P < .001; Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, r = .36, P = .02), daily orthopedic reading (r = .34, P = .03), increased preparation time for OITE (r = .31, P = .04), and more hours committed to studying (r = .37, P = .01). In addition, residents who emphasized prior OITEs and self-assessment examinations when preparing had higher scores (r = .53, P < .001, and r = .64, P < .001, respectively). Our study results show that several factors, including structured study habits and use of specific study materials, contribute to residents' successful OITE performance. Adaptation of these findings by current orthopedic residents may have a positive impact on OITE performance.",
