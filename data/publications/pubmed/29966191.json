  "title": "The Impact of Hospitalization on Readmission, Institutionalization, and Mortality of People with Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: People with dementia (PwD) are at a high risk of hospitalization. Hospitals are often not adequately equipped for PwD and discharges often come unexpected. Therefore, PwD are at a risk of adverse outcomes. However, information about those outcomes is rare but crucial for the development of preventive strategies. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a quantitative systematic review and meta-analyses on the impact of a hospitalization on readmission, institutionalization, and mortality in PwD. To identify factors associated with these outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, CENTRAL, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies including terms for dementia, hospital, readmission, institutionalization, and mortality. Relevant were assessed by a quality criteria sheet. Results were summarized in a table. Meta-analysis was conducted with Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: The search yielded 1,108 studies; 20 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 10 studies were eligible for meta-analyses. The incidence and relative risk (RR) of mortality (RR 1.74 CI95 % 1.50, 2.05) and institutionalization (RR: 2.16 CI95 % 1.31, 3.56) of PwD was significantly higher when compared to people without dementia. Results according to readmission rate were inconsistent. Factors significantly associated with the examined adverse outcomes were severity of dementia, number of medications, and deficits in daily living activities. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization of PwD lead to adverse outcomes. An improvement in the identification of and care for PwD in the acute setting as well as in after care in the community setting, especially in the interface between both settings, is required to prevent adverse outcomes in hospitalized PwD.",
