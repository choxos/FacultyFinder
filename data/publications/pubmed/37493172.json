  "title": "Non-pharmacological management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures: health-care professional perspectives and experiences.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To understand experiences and perceptions on non-pharmacological treatment of vertebral fractures and virtual-care from the perspective of care professionals' (HCPs). DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 HCPs within Canada (7 F, 6 M, aged 46 ± 12 years) and performed a thematic and content analysis from a post-positivism perspective. RESULTS: Two themes were identified: acuity matters when selecting appropriate interventions; and roadblocks to receiving non-pharmacological interventions. We found that treatment options were dependent on the acuity/stability of fracture and were individualized accordingly. Pain medication was perceived as important, but non-pharmacological strategies were also considered helpful in supporting recovery. Participants discussed barriers related to the timely identification of fracture, referral to physiotherapy, and lack of knowledge among HCPs on how to manage osteoporosis and vertebral fractures. HCPs reported positive use of virtual-care, but had concerns related to patient access, cost, and comprehensive assessments. CONCLUSION: HCPs used and perceived non-pharmacological interventions as helpful and selected specific treatments based on the recency of fracture and patient symptoms. HCPs' also believed that virtual-care that included an educational component, an assessment by a physiotherapist, and an exercise group was a feasible alternative, but concerns exist and may require further evaluation.",
