  "title": "Plantaris Tendon Autograft Can Restore Patellar Stability in Adolescent Medial Patellofemoral Ligament Reconstruction: A Technical Note.",
  "abstract": "Medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction is a standard treatment option for patients with patellar instability. The main purpose of this study was to determine whether isolated anatomic medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction using double folded, four-strand plantaris tendon autograft restores patellar stability in adolescent patients. Plantaris tendon autografts were harvested through proximal approach and used in four adolescent patients. A four-strand autograft was prepared in a double-limbed configuration and fixed on the patella and the femur with suture anchors and interference screws, respectively. The mean Kujala score improved significantly from 44 ± 24 SD (range, 19 to 69) points preoperatively to 94 ± 10 SD (range, 78 to 100) points postoperatively (P< 0.001). All patients reported excellent subjective outcomes and returned to their pre-injury level of sporting activities. The use of a four-strand plantaris tendon autograft in isolated anatomic medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction can restore patellar stability in adolescents.",
