  "title": "Ethical Considerations Regarding Financial Incentives in Plastic Surgery-Related Health Research.",
  "abstract": "Introduction: To recruit enough patients to achieve adequate statistical power in clinical research, investigators often rely on financial incentives. The use of these incentives, however, remains controversial as they may cause patients to overlook risks associated with research participation. This concern is amplified in the context of plastic surgery where aesthetic procedures are often more desirable and are not typically covered by public or private insurance plans. Despite this, the ethical debate regarding the use of incentives has largely been absent from plastic surgery journals; therefore, efforts to summarize the existing literature in the context of plastic surgery are necessary. Methods: A narrative review of the peer-reviewed published literature was performed to identify existing articles pertaining to financial incentives in plastic surgery-related health research. Results: While incentives have the potential to improve sample sizes and promote the recruitment of under-represented patient populations, undue inducement and biased recruitment are possible. At present, there exists a paucity of empirical evidence to substantiate this. Efforts should be taken by investigators and research ethics boards (REBs) to limit the potential negative impacts of monetary compensation. Investigators should place reasonable limits on the value of incentives as well as select models associated with lower risks of undue influence and enrollment bias. When financial remuneration is offered, additional care should be taken by investigators to ensure participants are adequately informed of the risks associated with research participation. Conclusion: Current best practice recommendations suggest that proposals submitted to REBs justify the incentives used. Information regarding incentives should also be included within study consent forms and communicated as part of the informed consent process.",
