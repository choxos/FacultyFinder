  "abstract": "This review article aims to summarize broadly recent developments in the treatment of HPV-associated cancers, including cervical cancer and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Relatively new treatments targeting the key HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins, including gene editing with TALENs and CRISPR/Cas9, are discussed. Given the increased immunogenicity of HPV-related diseases, other therapies such as PRR agonists, adoptive cell transfer, and tumor vaccines are reaching the clinical trial phase. Due to the mechanism, immunogenicity, and reversibility of HPV carcinogenesis, HPV-related cancers present unique targets for current and future therapies.",
