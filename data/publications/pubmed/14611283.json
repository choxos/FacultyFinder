  "title": "Electromagnetically induced transparency in semiconductors via biexciton coherence.",
  "abstract": "We report an experimental demonstration and theoretical analysis of electromagnetically induced transparency in a GaAs quantum well, in which the absorption of an exciton resonance is reduced by more than twentyfold. The destructive quantum interference in this scheme is set up by a control pulse that couples to a resonance of biexcitons. These studies illustrate that many-particle interactions, which are inherent in semiconductors and are often detrimental to quantum coherences, can also be harnessed to manipulate these coherences.",
