  "title": "Nivolumab in Squamous Cell Carcinomas of the Head and Neck (SCCHN): A Real-world Outcome Study in Ontario, Canada.",
  "abstract": "The CheckMate-141 trial led to the approval of nivolumab in platinum-resistant metastatic/advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). We evaluated the outcomes of SCCHN patients in Ontario, Canada, treated with nivolumab through retrospective review of the provincial treatment registry. Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate overall survival (OS) and Cox regression to evaluate the prognostic effect of selected factors. Nivolumab was used as second-line therapy after disease relapse for curative-intent platinum chemotherapy (PC) (indication 1-I1), as second-line therapy post-PC in noncurative intent (indication 2-I2), and as first-line therapy in noncurative intent due to contraindication for PC (indication 3-I3). The median OS for patients treated with nivolumab was 5.8 months (95% CI: 4.5-7.3), and the 1-year OS was 28.4% (CI: 2.10-36.1). When patients with I3 were excluded to match inclusion criteria for CheckMate-141, median OS was 4.8 months (CI: 3.6-6.7) with 1-year OS of 21.8% (14.4-30.1). Patients with lower body surface area (BSA) (<1.81) had a median OS of 3.9 months (CI: 3.1-6.7) versus 9.0 months (CI: 6.5-14.8) in those with higher BSA, hazard ratio (HR)=0.12 (CI: 0.04-0.39, P <0.001). Patients receiving nivolumab for I1 had a median OS of 7.2 months (CI 3.8-9.8) versus 11.9 months (CI: 6.2-not reached) for I3, HR=1.73 (CI: 0.94-3.16). Patients receiving nivolumab for I2 had a median OS of 3.9 months (CI: 2.9-5.4) as compared with I3, HR=3.27 (CI: 1.80-5.94). Real-world analysis of patients with advanced/metastatic SCCHN in Ontario, Canada, treated with nivolumab demonstrates poorer median OS compared with CheckMate-141 trial. Lower BSA was a predictor of poorer median OS.",
