  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is a widely recognized bariatric procedure that is particularly beneficial for patients with class III obesity. It aids in significant weight loss and improves obesity-related medical conditions. Despite its effectiveness, postoperative care still has challenges. Clinical evidence shows that venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a leading cause of 30-d morbidity and mortality after RYGB. Therefore, a clear unmet need exists for a tailored risk assessment tool for VTE in RYGB candidates. AIM: To develop and internally validate a scoring system determining the individualized risk of 30-d VTE in patients undergoing RYGB. METHODS: Using the 2016-2021 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation Quality Improvement Program, data from 6526 patients (body mass index â‰¥ 40 kg/m[2]) who underwent RYGB were analyzed. A backward elimination multivariate analysis identified predictors of VTE characterized by pulmonary embolism and/or deep venous thrombosis within 30 d of RYGB. The resultant risk scores were derived from the coefficients of statistically significant variables. The performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating curves through 5-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: Of the 26 initial variables, six predictors were identified. These included a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a regression coefficient (Coef) of 2.54 (P < 0.001), length of stay (Coef 0.08, P < 0.001), prior deep venous thrombosis (Coef 1.61, P < 0.001), hemoglobin A1c > 7% (Coef 1.19, P < 0.001), venous stasis history (Coef 1.43, P < 0.001), and preoperative anticoagulation use (Coef 1.24, P < 0.001). These variables were weighted according to their regression coefficients in an algorithm that was generated for the model predicting 30-d VTE risk post-RYGB. The risk model's area under the curve (AUC) was 0.79 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.63-0.81], showing good discriminatory power, achieving a sensitivity of 0.60 and a specificity of 0.91. Without training, the same model performed satisfactorily in patients with laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with an AUC of 0.63 (95%CI: 0.62-0.64) and endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty with an AUC of 0.76 (95%CI: 0.75-0.78). CONCLUSION: This simple risk model uses only six variables to assist clinicians in the preoperative risk stratification of RYGB patients, offering insights into factors that heighten the risk of VTE events.",
