  "title": "Immigrants, Ethnicity, and Adherence to Secondary Cardiac Prevention Therapy: A Substudy of the ISLAND Trial.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate adherence to guideline-recommended cardiac secondary prevention therapies by immigration and ethnicity. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective substudy of the Interventions Supporting Long-Term Adherence and Decreasing Cardiovascular Events (ISLAND) randomized controlled trial. A cohort of 1642 participants was analyzed. Patients were categorized based on their self-reported immigrant status as being Canadian or foreign born and based on their visual minority status (as European or a visual minority). We used logistic regression to examine associations between these patient characteristics of interest and patient adherence to statin medication 1 year after myocardial infarction (MI) and completion of cardiac rehabilitation, adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: The dataset included outcome data on 1049 (64%) Canadian-born patients and 593 (36%) immigrants. There were 347 (21%) who identified as a visual minority. We report a nonsignificant trend in statin adherence 1 year after MI favouring foreign-born participants compared with Canadian-born participants (odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.91-1.68). Visual minorities were found to have no significant difference in statin adherence 1 year after MI compared with participants of European ethnicity (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.72-1.51). Neither immigration status (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.72-1.15) nor visual minority status (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73-1.28) were associated with cardiac rehabilitation completion. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings offer limited support that immigrants with > 10 years of Canadian residency exposure experience greater adherence to statins 1 year after MI. Further research is required to better inform our understanding of secondary prevention strategy among immigrant populations.",
