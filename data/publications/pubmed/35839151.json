  "title": "Hazard rate for postoperative recurrence in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage 0 or A1: A multicenter observational study.",
  "abstract": "AIM: Surgical treatment is the first-line treatment for patients with Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage 0 or A1 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and postoperative monitoring improves long-term survival. We aimed to establish a reasonable short-interval follow-up duration for patients with HCC. METHODS: The cohort for this retrospective study included 1396 HCC patients with BCLC stage 0 or A1 disease who underwent curative resection from 2013 to 2016 at five centers in China. Hazard rates for recurrence were calculated using the hazard function. RESULTS: The recurrence rates in patients with BCLC stage 0 and A1 HCC were 46.4% and 58.0%, respectively. The hazard curve for stage 0 patients was relatively flat, and the hazard rate was consistently low (peak hazard rate 0.0163). The hazard rate curve for recurrence was initially high (peak hazard rate 0.0441) in patients with BCLC stage A1 disease and showed a rapid decreasing trend within 1 year, followed by a slow decreasing trend, reaching a low level (<0.0163) at approximately 36 months. The time to low risk was 47, 41, and 51 months in patients with cirrhosis, hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, and satellite lesions, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A short-interval follow-up of 1 year is sufficient for HCC patients with BCLC stage 0 disease, whereas a short-interval follow-up time of 3 years should be considered for patients with stage A1 disease. The follow-up period should be appropriately prolonged for patients with cirrhosis, HBV infection, and satellite lesions.",
