  "title": "A Novel Field-Deployable Method for Sequencing and Analyses of Henipavirus Genomes From Complex Samples on the MinION Platform.",
  "abstract": "Viruses in the genus Henipavirus encompass 2 highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic pathogens, Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV). Despite the impact on human health, there is currently limited full-genome sequence information available for henipaviruses. This lack of full-length genomes hampers our ability to understand the molecular drivers of henipavirus emergence. Furthermore, rapidly deployable viral genome sequencing can be an integral part of outbreak response and epidemiological investigations to study transmission chains. In this study, we describe the development of a reverse-transcription, long-range polymerase chain reaction (LRPCR) assay for efficient genome amplification of NiV, HeV, and a related non-pathogenic henipavirus, Cedar virus (CedPV). We then demonstrated the utility of our method by amplifying partial viral genomes from 6 HeV-infected tissue samples from Syrian hamsters and 4 tissue samples from a NiV-infected African green monkey with viral loads as low as 52 genome copies/mg. We subsequently sequenced the amplified genomes on the portable Oxford Nanopore MinION platform and analyzed the data using a newly developed field-deployable bioinformatic pipeline. Our LRPCR assay allows amplification and sequencing of 2 or 4 amplicons in semi-nested reactions. Coupled with an easy-to-use bioinformatics pipeline, this method is particularly useful in the field during outbreaks in resource-poor environments.",
