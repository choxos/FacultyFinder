  "title": "Relationship between lung function impairment, hypertension, and major adverse cardiovascular events: A 10-year follow-up study.",
  "abstract": "Lung function impairment and hypertension, especially hypertension, are risk factors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). However, the relationships among lung function impairment, hypertension, and MACEs have not been well-reported. We aimed to investigate the association between lung function and hypertension and MACEs. We studied 6769 people who were a representative sample of the general population in Jiangsu Province using the multi-stage stratified cluster sampling method. The average age was 51.54 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze the relationships between the blood pressure status and various types of lung function impairment related to MACEs. Over a follow-up of 10 years, 236 MACEs occurred. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, smoking, drinking, education, physical activity, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, creatine and use of antihypertensive drugs, hypertension [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.154, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.565-2.966], and restrictive lung function impairment (RLFI) (HR = 1.398, 95% CI: 1.021-1.879) were independently associated with MACEs. Individuals with hypertension and RFLI had the highest risk for MACEs (HR = 2.930, 95% CI: 1.734-4.953) and stroke (HR = 3.296, 95% CI: 1.862-5.832). Moreover, when combined with hypertension, obstructive lung function impairment (OLFI) (HR = 2.376, 95% CI: 1.391-4.056) and mixed lung function impairment (MLFI) (HR = 2.423, 95% CI: 1.203-4.882) were associated with MACEs. There is a synergistic effect of lung function impairment (especially RLFI) and hypertension on MACEs. Therefore, more attention should be paid to the incidence of MACEs in individuals with impaired lung function, especially those who have hypertension.",
