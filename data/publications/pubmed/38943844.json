  "abstract": "Recent breakthroughs in cancer immunology have propelled immunotherapy to the forefront of cancer research as a promising treatment approach that harnesses the body's immune system to effectively identify and eliminate cancer cells. In this study, three novel cyclometalated Ir(III) complexes, Ir1, Ir2, and Ir3, were designed, synthesized, and assessed in vitro for cytotoxic activity against several tumor-derived cell lines. Among these, Ir1 exhibited the highest cytotoxic activity, with an IC50 value of 0.4 ± 0.1 μM showcasing its significant anticancer potential. Detailed mechanistic analysis revealed that co-incubation of Ir1 with 143B cells led to Ir1 accumulation within mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Furthermore, Ir1 induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest, while also diminishing mitochondrial membrane potential, disrupting mitochondrial function, and triggering ER stress. Intriguingly, in mice the Ir1-induced ER stress response disrupted calcium homeostasis to thereby trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD), which subsequently activated the host antitumor immune response while concurrently dampening the in vivo tumor-induced inflammatory response.",
