  "abstract": "You graduate from medical school with dreams of beginning your residency, during which you will study and train within the specialty you love more than any other. While you may be book-smart at this point in your career, medical school does not teach you everything you need to know. During residency you will learn the didactic and technical requirements for your future staff job, but medical school won't explicitly address many of the crucial \"dos and don'ts\" of a successful 2- to 5-year postgraduate training voyage. Here we discuss a few of the important things about residency that you'll need to know that they don't teach you in medical school.",
