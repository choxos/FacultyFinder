  "title": "Pragmatic monitoring of emerging efficacy data in randomized controlled trials.",
  "abstract": "Monitoring the conduct of phase III randomized controlled trials is driven by ethical reasons to protect the study integrity and the safety of trial participants. We propose a group sequential, pragmatic approach for monitoring the accumulating efficacy information in randomized controlled trials. The \"Population Health Research Institute boundary\" is simple to implement and sensible, as it considers the reduction in uncertainty with increasing information as the study progresses. It is also pragmatic, since it takes into consideration the typical monitoring behavior of monitoring committees of large multicenter trials and is relatively easily implemented. It not only controls the overall Lan-DeMets type I error probability (alpha) spent, but performs better than other group sequential boundaries for the total nominal study alpha. We illustrate the use of our monitoring approach in the early termination of two past completed trials.",
