  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: We compared the effectiveness of cefazolin and cloxacillin as definitive antibiotic therapy for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) spinal epidural abscess (SEA). METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included patients with MSSA SEA from two academic hospitals in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, between 2014 and 2020. Patients treated with cefazolin were compared to those treated with cloxacillin. Co-primary outcomes included 90-day mortality, antibiotic failure, adverse reactions and recurrence. Inverse probability of treatment weighting using propensity scores was used to balance important prognostic factors and to estimate an adjusted risk difference. RESULTS: Of 98 patients with MSSA SEA, 50 and 48 patients were treated with cefazolin and cloxacillin, respectively. Mortality at 90 days was 8% and 13% in the cefazolin and cloxacillin groups, respectively (P = 0.52). The antibiotic failure rate was 12% and 19% in the cefazolin and cloxacillin groups, respectively (P = 0.41). The serious adverse reactions rate was 0% and 4% in the cefazolin and cloxacillin groups, respectively (P = 0.24). The recurrence rate was 2% and 8% in the cefazolin and cloxacillin groups, respectively (P = 0.20). The adjusted risk difference for mortality at 90 days was -1% [95% confidence interval (CI) -10% to 8%] favouring cefazolin. The adjusted risk differences for antibiotic failure, adverse reactions and recurrence were 1% (95% CI -12% to 14%), -5% (95% CI -11% to 2%) and -18% (-36% to -1%) respectively. CONCLUSION: Cefazolin is likely as effective as an antistaphylococcal penicillin and may be considered as a first-line treatment for MSSA SEA.",
