  "title": "10-year outcomes of the vertical transected gastric bypass for obesity: a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "With increasing worldwide obesity rates, the surgery of choice has become the vertical transected gastric bypass, showing short-term improvements in weight loss and comorbidities. However, corresponding 10-year data regarding such endpoints is limited. The objective of this review was to assess such evidence. A literature search yielded a total of five studies, of which three had extractable data. Results revealed a reduction in the weighted mean body mass index (BMI), from a pre- to post-operative mean BMI of 47.5 kg/m(2) ± 2.0 to 33.4 kg/m(2) ± 4.4 at 10 years. The weighted mean excess weight loss was 61.4 % ± 13.5. Although these results suggest that weight reduction may be sustainable in the long term, this systematic review demonstrates a lack of strong evidence to support favorable long-term outcomes following vertical transected gastric bypass for obesity.",
