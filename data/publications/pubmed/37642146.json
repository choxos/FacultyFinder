  "title": "Overexpression of Plg-RKT protects against adipose dysfunction and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis in diet-induced obese mice.",
  "abstract": "The plasminogen receptor, Plg-RKT, is a unique cell surface receptor that is broadly expressed in cells and tissues throughout the body. Plg-RKT localizes plasminogen on cell surfaces and promotes its activation to the broad-spectrum serine protease, plasmin. In this study, we show that overexpression of Plg-RKT protects mice from high fat diet (HFD)-induced adipose and metabolic dysfunction. During the first 10 weeks on the HFD, the body weights of mice that overexpressed Plg-RKT (Plg-RKT-OEX) were lower than those of control mice (CagRosaPlgRKT). After 10 weeks on the HFD, CagRosaPlgRKT and Plg-RKT-OEX mice had similar body weights. However, Plg-RKT-OEX mice showed a more metabolically favourable body composition phenotype. Plg-RKT-OEX mice also showed improved glucose tolerance and increased insulin sensitivity. We found that the improved metabolic functions of Plg-RKT-OEX mice were mechanistically associated with increased energy expenditure and activity, decreased proinflammatory adipose macrophages and decreased inflammation, elevated brown fat thermogenesis, and higher expression of adipose PPARÎ³ and adiponectin. These findings suggest that Plg-RKT signalling promotes healthy adipose function via multiple mechanisms to defend against obesity-associated adverse metabolic phenotypes.",
