  "abstract": "In patients with diabetes and cardiovascular or renal comorbidities, circulating levels of the N-terminal fragment of prohormone B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) have similar discriminatory ability as multivariate models for prediction of cardiovascular events or death. We validated this finding in patients with dysglycemia not selected for co-existing cardiorenal diseases.",
