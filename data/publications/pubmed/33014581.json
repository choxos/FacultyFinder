  "title": "Infrared spectral microscopy as a tool to monitor lung fibrosis development in a model system.",
  "abstract": "Tissue fibrosis is a progressive and destructive disease process that can occur in many different organs including the liver, kidney, skin, and lungs. Fibrosis is typically initiated by inflammation as a result of chronic insults such as infection, chemicals and autoimmune diseases. Current approaches to examine organ fibrosis are limited to radiological and histological analyses. Infrared spectroscopic imaging offers a potential alternative approach to gain insight into biochemical changes associated with fibrosis progression. In this study, we demonstrate that IR imaging of a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis can identify biochemical changes observed with fibrosis progression and the beginning of resolution using K-means analysis, spectral ratios and multivariate data analysis. This study demonstrates that IR imaging may be a useful approach to understand the biochemical events associated with fibrosis initiation, progression and resolution for both the clinical setting and for assessing novel anti-fibrotic drugs in a model system.",
