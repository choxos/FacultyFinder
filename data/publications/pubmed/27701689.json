  "abstract": "The burden of disease of influenza in Germany has been dominated by high rates of complications in elderly patients in years with high circulation of H3N2 viruses after the introduction of the new H1N1 strain in 2009. Human infections with avian influenza viruses occur mostly in China. Due to the potential of reassortment with human strains these cases are monitored closely. The efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors (NI) has been newly rated. In randomized studies effects on reduction of complications could not be found, although large cohort studies have demonstrated a reduction of mortality in patients treated with vs. without neuraminidase inhibitors.The administration and acceptance of influenza vaccine is low in Germany in general and in risk populations. New vaccines have been introduced with quadrivalent vaccines covering both circulating B-types simultaneously and high dose vaccines for elder patients.",
