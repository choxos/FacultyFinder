  "abstract": "AIMS: Morus alba is a plant that is well known for its medicinal properties. In Asian countries, it is traditionally used for anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and antioxidant applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antiulcer and antioxidant activity of a new steroid from M. alba. MAIN METHODS: Column chromatography was employed to isolate different compounds from M. alba. The molecular structures of the compounds were characterized via IR, UV, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectroscopic methods. A newly isolated compound was tested for antiulcer activity in pylorus-ligation- and ethanol-induced ulcer models and biochemically estimated for SOD, CAT, GR, GPx, GSH and LPO levels. KEY FINDINGS: Five new compounds were isolated; one of these was a new steroid named albosteroid. This new compound exhibits significant (P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.001) antiulcer activity in pylorus-ligation- and ethanol-induced ulcer models. Furthermore, this compound showed significant dose-dependent reversal of ethanol-diminished activity in antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, GPx and GSH, and reduced the ethanol-elevated levels of GR and LPO. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study clearly demonstrates the anti-ulcer and antioxidant potential of compound 1, which was supported by macroscopic and histopathological studies of stomach wall tissues of differently treated groups of rats.",
