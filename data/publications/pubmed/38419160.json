  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the fastest-growing indication for liver transplantation (LT). Sex disparities among patients with cirrhosis on the LT waitlist are well known. We wanted to understand these disparities further in women with end-stage liver disease patients listed for NASH cirrhosis in a contemporary cohort. METHODS: We used data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients to assess sex racial, and ethnic differences in NASH patients listed for LT. Adults transplanted from August 1997 to June 2021 were included. Inferential statistics were used to evaluate differences with univariate and multivariate comparisons, including competitive risk analysis. RESULTS: During the study time period, we evaluated 12 844 LT for NASH cirrhosis. Women were transplanted at a lower rate (46.5% versus 53.5%; P  < 0.001) and higher model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) (23.8 versus 22.6; P < 0.001) than men. Non-White women were transplanted at a higher MELD (26.1 versus 23.1; P  < 0.001) than White women and non-White male patients (26.1 versus 24.8; P  < 0.001). Graft and patient survivals were significantly different (P  < 0.001) between non-White women and White women and men (White and non-White). CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of LT candidates in the United States demonstrates women with NASH cirrhosis have a higher MELD than men at LT. Additional disparities exist among non-White women with NASH as they have higher MELD and creatinine at LT compared with White women. After LT, non-White women have worse graft and patient survival compared with men or White women. These data indicate that non-White women with NASH are the most vulnerable on the LT waitlist.",
