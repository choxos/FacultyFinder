  "title": "Evaluation of dietary electrolyte balance on nursery pig performance.",
  "abstract": "Increasing dietary electrolyte balance (dEB) has been reported to linearly improve pig growth performance up to approximately 200 to 250 mEq/kg. However, recent data indicate that increasing dietary dEB reduced growth performance of nursery pigs. To attempt to solve this discrepancy, a total of 2,880 weanling pigs (327 × 1,050; PIC, Hendersonville, TN; 5.2 kg initial BW) were used to determine the effects of increasing dEB on nursery pig performance. Pens of pigs were blocked by BW and gender on arrival. Within block, pens were randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments. There were 30 pigs per pen (60 pigs per double-sided feeder) and 12 replications (feeder) per treatment. Dietary treatments were fed in two phases. The phase 1 diet was based on corn-soybean meal, contained dried distillers grains with soblubles (DDGS), spray-dried whey, and specialty protein sources, and was fed from days 0 to 8. The phase 2 (days 8 to 21) diets contained corn, soybean meal, and DDGS with reduced amounts of specialty protein sources. Dietary electrolyte balance was determined using the following equation: dEB = [(Na × 434.98) + (K × 255.74) - (Cl × 282.06)] mEq/kg. The dEB of the four phase 1 diets were 84, 137, 190, and 243 mEq/kg, and dEB of the four phase 2 diets were 29, 86, 143, and 199 mEq/kg. After feeding experimental diets for 21 day, a common, commercial corn-soybean meal diet was fed to all pigs from days 21 to 35 and contained a dEB of 257 mEq/kg. During days 0 to 8, increasing dEB increased (quadratic, P < 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and G:F. From days 8 to 21, increasing dEB improved ADG (quadratic, P = 0.022) and ADFI (linear, P = 0.001), resulting in an improvement (quadratic, P = 0.001) in G:F. Overall (days 0 to 21), increasing dEB increased (linear, P < 0.05) ADG, ADFI, and improved (quadratic, P < 0.001) G:F. When a common diet was fed to all pigs from days 21 to 35, there was a linear reduction in ADG and G:F with increasing dietary dEB, but no effect of ADFI. For the overall nursery period (days 0 to 35), increasing dEB from days 0 to 21 increased (linear, P < 0.001) ADG and final BW, which was the result of increased (quadratic, P < 0.05) G:F and marginally greater (linear, P = 0.077) ADFI. In conclusion, increasing dietary dEB up to 243 and 199 mEq/kg (in phases 1 and 2, respectively) in nursery diets improved growth performance of weanling pigs.",
