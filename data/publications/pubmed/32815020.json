  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Post-operative changes in eating behavior, eating-related distress and eating-related symptoms play an important role in the lives of bariatric surgery patients. However, there are no studies that assess these outcomes using a specifically designed patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We use our newly developed and validated scales as part of the well-established BODY-Q PROMs to compare laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass patients (LRYGB). METHODS: We analyzed data from an international multi-center prospective cohort study of patients over 18 who underwent bariatric surgery. We used multivariable linear regression models to assess the difference between LRYGB and LSG for the new BODY-Q scales, which include eating behavior, eating-related distress and eating-related symptoms. All analyses were corrected for significant confounding variables. RESULTS: Out of 1420 patients, 920 underwent LRYGB and 500 underwent LSG. The LRYGB group had a higher percentage total weight loss (p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in eating behavior (e.g., stop eating before feeling full, avoiding unhealthy snacks, etc.) or eating-related distress (e.g., feeling ashamed or out of control after eating). Patients who underwent LSG scored significantly better on the post-prandial eating-related symptoms scale (e.g., vomiting, reflux; p < 0.001). Symptoms more prevalent in the LRYGB patients were related to dumping syndrome whereas symptoms more prevalent in LSG patients were related to reflux. CONCLUSION: Patients who underwent LRYGB had a significantly better weight loss after surgery, but they scored worse on post-prandial symptoms in comparison to LSG patients. This information may be relevant for patients in the pre-operative counseling setting, as it may influence their decision for surgical procedure selection.",
