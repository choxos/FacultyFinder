  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: BRCA mutations have been associated with improved outcomes in ovarian cancer patients. This study's objective was to compare the secondary cytoreduction surgery (SCS) rates among ovarian cancer patients by BRCA mutation status. METHODS: The study was retrospective and included platinum sensitive recurrent high grade serous ovarian cancer patients from one Canadian center and two Israeli centers from January 1999 to December 2018. Demographic and genetic data, tumor characteristics, patterns of recurrence and surgical and medical treatments were obtained from electronic charts. Patients were grouped according to BRCA mutation status. Logistic regression analyses were used to explore potential prognostic factors of secondary cytoreduction. RESULTS: 147 patients were enrolled, including 97 from Canada and 50 from Israel. Forty-seven patients (32%) had a BRCA mutation, including 39 (26.5%) germline mutations and 8 (5.5%) somatic mutations. Thirty-one patients (21.1%) underwent SCS. The rate of SCS was 33.3% among the germline BRCA mutation carriers and 15.7% among patients without germline BRCA mutation (p = 0.026). Predictors of secondary cytoreduction included germline BRCA mutation (OR = 2.5, p = 0.03), time to recurrence (OR = 1.004 per month, p < 0.001), absence of lymphatic recurrence (OR = 3.08, p = 0.013), three or fewer lesions at recurrence (OR = 36.74, p < 0.001) and absence of ascites (OR = 9.1, p = 0.034). After adjusting for the number of lesions at recurrence, no other variable remained a significant predictor. CONCLUSION: Germline BRCA mutation carriers are more likely to undergo secondary cytoreduction. This may be mediated in part by lower volume disease at recurrence. This observation should be considered when planning surveillance for these patients after first-line treatment.",
