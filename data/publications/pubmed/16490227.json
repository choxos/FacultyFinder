  "title": "Parapoxviruses of seals and sea lions make up a distinct subclade within the genus Parapoxvirus.",
  "abstract": "Poxviruses of seals and sea lions have been tentatively identified as both orthopoxviruses and parapoxviruses, but their exact identity remained unconfirmed. Here, poxviral DNA sequences were generated from 39 clinical cases and compared to sequences from earlier poxvirus isolates from seals (Phocidae) and sea lions (Otariidae). Six genetically distinct poxvirus strains were detected, of which three were previously unrecognized. All detected strains were closely related to the parapoxviruses, confirming their classification as members of the genus Parapoxvirus. A phylogenetic analysis showed that pinniped parapoxviruses form a monophyletic group within the genus Parapoxvirus. Parapoxviruses from Atlantic pinnipeds were phylogenetically distant from those of Pacific pinnipeds. Parapoxviruses from phocids and otariids that inhabit the same geographical region were also phylogenetically distant, suggesting that parapoxviruses are not commonly transmitted between free-ranging phocids and otariids. However, one strain was detected in two otariid species, suggesting that pinniped parapoxviruses are capable of infecting multiple species within a phylogenetic family.",
