  "title": "Developing a 'model of transition' prior to preceptorship.",
  "abstract": "It has long been recognized (Kramer, 1974) that the transition from student to qualified nurse or midwife is a steep learning curve which Kramer famously described as a 'reality shock'. The University Hospital of North Staffordshire (UHNS) NHS Trust has recently taken its established preceptorship programme a step further by integrating 'key' components into the final module (module 9) of nurse/midwifery training, now referred to as the 'transition' module. The development of this new and exciting 'shared learning' approach has been the result of collaborative working with the tutors at Keele University and the clinical education team at the UHNS Trust. The subject material introduced into module 9 aims to both reflect and support the current university curriculum. Initial verbal and written feedback from students who have progressed through the 'transition' module has been both positive and encouraging. Students have identified that they feel more prepared to take on their new roles, confident in the knowledge that they can seek support from the lead preceptor nurse/midwife prior to qualifying.",
