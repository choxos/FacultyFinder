  "title": "Rural gerontological health: Emergent questions for research, policy and practice.",
  "abstract": "This article explores what can be learned from the evolution of rural gerontology as a field of study to inform a more critical approach to the health of rural older adults. To counter the prevailing essentialism of highlighting the rural health disparities faced by older adults, there is a need to expand rural gerontological health research beyond deficit and medicalized understandings of health in rural communities. We argue that appreciating the interplay between unique health experiences, the complexity of the rural context and the continuum of older adult care is an important next step to foster advances in the field. Emergent questions for research, policy and practice are discussed and new directions for rural gerontological health are proposed.",
