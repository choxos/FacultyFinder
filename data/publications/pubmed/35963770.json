  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Hospital-acquired venous thromboembolisms (HA-VTEs) are increasingly common in pediatric inpatients and associated with significant morbidity and cost. The Braden QD Scale was created to predict the risk of hospital-acquired pressure injury (HAPI) and is used broadly in children's hospitals. This study evaluated the ability of the Braden QD Total score to predict risk of HA-VTE at a quaternary children's hospital. METHODS: To analyze the predictive potential of the Braden QD Total score and subscores for HA-VTEs, the researchers performed univariate logistic regressions. The increase in a patient's odds of developing an HA-VTE for every 1-point increase in each Braden QD score was evaluated. Each model was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validated area-under-the-curve of the corresponding receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). RESULTS: This study analyzed 27,689 pediatric inpatients. HA-VTE occurred in 135 patients. The odds of HA-VTE incidence increased by 29% (odds ratio 1.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.34, p < 0.001) for every 1-point increase in a patient's Braden QD Total score. The AUROC was 0.81 (95% CI 0.77-0.85). CONCLUSION: The Braden QD Scale is a predictor for HA-VTE, outperforming its original intended use for predicting HAPI and performing similarly to other HA-VTE predictive models. As the Braden QD Total score is currently recorded in the electronic health records of many children's hospitals, it could be practically and easily implemented as a tool to predict which patients are at risk for HA-VTE.",
