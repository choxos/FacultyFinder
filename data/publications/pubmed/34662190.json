  "title": "Secondary Analysis of a Systematic Review: Are Antifungal Noninferiority Trials at Risk of Eroding Effectiveness Because of Biocreep?",
  "abstract": "Noninferiority randomized controlled trial (RCT) effectiveness may erode when results favor the active control over time and when a decreasingly effective control arm is used in serial trials. We analyzed 32 antifungal noninferiority RCTs (NI-RCTs) for these scenarios in this secondary analysis of a systematic review. Our exploratory analysis suggests that the erosion risk in the effectiveness of antifungal noninferiority trials is uncommon. Findings are limited by small sample size and overall risk of bias.",
