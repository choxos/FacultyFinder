  "title": "Local environments, accessibility and affordability: A qualitative analysis of alcohol purchasing across different socio-economic areas in Victoria, Australia.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Alcohol purchasing practices-linked to consumption practices and potential harms-vary across socio-economic environments. While there is an epidemiological link between purchasing and harm, little qualitative research unpacks purchasing practices with an eye to socio-economic status (SES). Drawing on qualitative interviews, this paper takes an ecological approach to examine how people in different SES areas discuss their alcohol purchasing practices to understand how SES influences alcohol purchasing. METHODS: This analysis draws on 45 interviews with people who drink alcohol in Victoria, Australia conducted in 2023-2024. Participants were purposively recruited from low, middle and high SES neighbourhoods. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. RESULTS: Accessibility to alcohol outlets influenced purchasing patterns, with those in low SES neighbourhoods facing barriers to accessing on-premises venues. Neighbourhood-level norms shaped feelings of safety and enthusiasm for attending on-premises venues, often tied to local gentrification. Low SES neighbourhood participants were more constrained by on-premises costs but less conscious of alcohol budgeting, in contrast to the middle and high SES neighbourhood participants, who were more intentional about their budgeting. Participants from all groups noted cost of living concerns influenced alcohol affordability, contrasting this with the continued affordability of cheap wine. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This analysis provides important context as to how neighbourhood SES can influence purchasing practices. Notably, the emphasis on off-premises purchasing was common across the groups, influenced by cost of living pressures and perceived affordability of wine.",
