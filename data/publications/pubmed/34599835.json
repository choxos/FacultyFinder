  "title": "Challenges working with men: Australian therapists' perspectives.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Emerging research highlights that therapists experience difficulty engaging and retaining male clients in talk therapy. Understanding therapists' challenges when working with men can inform gender-specific training efforts. METHODS: Open-ended qualitative survey data were collected from a sample of 421 Australian-based therapists. Participants described that which they find most challenging about therapeutic work with men. Responses were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: Three themes were revealed: (1) men's wavering commitment and engagement; (2) males as ill-equipped for therapy; and (3) therapists' uncertainty. Contrasting state and trait constructs, much of the men's state-based wavering commitment and engagement was positioned as amenable to change whereas traits assigned men as ill-equipped for therapy and unreachable. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore a clear need to better target training efforts to directly respond to the needs of therapists working with men, such that all therapists are well-equipped to meet men with gender-sensitive therapy.",
