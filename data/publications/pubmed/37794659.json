  "title": "Evaluation of the reproducibility of responses to nasal allergen challenge and effects of inhaled nasal corticosteroids.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Similar immune responses in the nasal and bronchial mucosa implies that nasal allergen challenge (NAC) is a suitable early phase experimental model for drug development targeting allergic rhinitis (AR) and asthma. We assessed NAC reproducibility and the effects of intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) on symptoms, physiology, and inflammatory mediators. METHODS: 20 participants with mild atopic asthma and AR underwent three single blinded nasal challenges each separated by three weeks (NCT03431961). Cohort A (n = 10) underwent a control saline challenge, followed by two allergen challenges. Cohort B (n = 10) underwent a NAC with no treatment intervention, followed by NAC with 14 days pre-treatment with saline nasal spray (placebo), then NAC with 14 days pre-treatment with INCS (220 μg triamcinolone acetonide twice daily). Nasosorption, nasal lavage, blood samples, forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1), total nasal symptom score (TNSS), peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) were collected up to 24 h after NAC. Total and active tryptase were measured as early-phase allergy biomarkers (≤30 min) and IL-13 and eosinophil cell counts as late-phase allergy biomarkers (3-7 h) in serum and nasal samples. Period-period reproducibility was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and sample size estimates were performed using effect sizes measured after INCS. RESULTS: NAC significantly induced acute increases in nasosorption tryptase and TNSS and reduced PNIF, and induced late increases in nasosorption IL-13 with sustained reductions in PNIF. Reproducibility across NACs varied for symptoms and biomarkers, with total tryptase 5 min post NAC having the highest reproducibility (ICC = 0.91). Treatment with INCS inhibited NAC-induced IL-13 while blunting changes in TNSS and PNIF. For a similar crossover study, 7 participants per treatment arm are needed to detect treatment effects comparable to INCS for TNSS. CONCLUSION: NAC-induced biomarkers and symptoms are reproducible and responsive to INCS. NAC is suitable for assessing pharmacodynamic activity and proof of mechanism for drugs targeting allergic inflammation.",
