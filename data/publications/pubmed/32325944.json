  "abstract": "With the immersive growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) and real-time adaptability, quality of life for people is improving. IoT applications are diverse in nature and one crucial aspect of it is multimedia sensors and devices. These IoT multimedia devices form the Internet of Multimedia Things (IoMT). It generates a massive volume of data with different characteristics and requirements than the IoT. The real-time deployment scenarios vary from smart traffic monitoring to smart hospitals. Hence, Timely delivery of IoMT data and decision making is critical as it directly involves the safety of human beings. In this paper, we present a brief overview of IoMT and future research directions. Afterward, we provide an overview of the accepted articles in our special issue on the IoMT: Opportunities, Challenges, and Solutions.",
