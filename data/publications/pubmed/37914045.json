  "title": "Melatonin alleviated cadmium accumulation and toxicity by modulating phytohormonal balance and antioxidant metabolism in rice.",
  "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) contamination is an eminent dilemma that jeopardizes global food safety and security, especially through its phytotoxicity in rice; one of the most edible crops. Melatonin (MET) has emerged as a protective phytohormone in stress conditions, but the defensive role and underlying mechanisms of MET against Cd toxicity in rice still remain unclear. To fulfill this knowledge gap, the present study is to uncover the key mechanisms for MET-mediated Cd-stress tolerance in rice. Cd toxicity significantly reduced growth by hindering the process of photosynthesis, cellular redox homeostasis, phytohormonal imbalance, and ultrastructural damages. Contrarily, MET supplementation considerably improved growth attributes, photosynthetic efficiency, and cellular ultrastructure as measured by gas exchange elements, chlorophyll content, reduced Cd accumulation, and ultrastructural analysis via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). MET treatment significantly reduced Cd accumulation (39.25%/31.58%), MDA (25.87%/19.45%), H2O2 (17.93%/9.56%), and O2 (29.11%/27.14%) levels in shoot/root tissues, respectively, when compared with Cd treatment. More importantly, MET manifested association with stress responsive phytohormones (ABA and IAA) and boosted the defense mechanisms of plant by enhancing the activities of ROS-scavenging antioxidant enzymes (SOD; superoxide dismutase, POD; peroxidase, CAT; catalase, APX; ascorbate peroxidase) and as well as regulating the key stress-responsive genes (OsSOD1, OsPOD1, OsCAT2, OsAPX1), thereby reinstate cellular membrane integrity and confer tolerance to ultrastructural damages under Cd-induced phytotoxicity. Overall, our findings emphasized the potential of MET as a long-term and cost-effective approach to Cd remediation in paddy soils, which can pave the way for a healthier and more environmentally conscious agricultural sector.",
