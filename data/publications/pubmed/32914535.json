  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite advances in treatment options for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), there are still limited high quality data to inform clinicians regarding its management. METHODS: In June 2018, the ISTH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel to issue recommendations about treatment of TTP. The panel discussed 12 treatment questions related to both immune-mediated TTP (iTTP) and hereditary/congenital TTP (cTTP). The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence and formulate recommendations. RESULTS: The panel agreed on eleven recommendations based on evidence ranging from very low to moderate certainty. For first episode and relapses of acute iTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for the addition of corticosteroids to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE), and a conditional recommendation for addition of rituximab and caplacizumab. For asymptomatic iTTP with low ADAMTS13, the panel made a conditional recommendation for rituximab outside of pregnancy, and for prophylactic TPE during pregnancy. For asymptomatic cTTP, the panel made a strong recommendation for prophylactic plasma infusion during pregnancy, but a conditional recommendation for plasma infusion or a wait and watch approach outside of pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The panel's recommendations are based on all the available evidence for the treatment effects of various approaches including suppressing inflammation, blocking platelet clumping, replacing the missing and/or inhibited ADAMTS13, and suppressing ADAMTS13 antibody production. There was insufficient evidence for further comparison of different treatment approaches, for which future high-quality studies in iTTP (e.g., rituximab, corticosteroids, recombinant ADAMTS13, and caplacizumab) and in cTTP (eg, recombinant ADAMTS13) are needed.",
