  "title": "Re-drawing the map: a case study of decolonized research methods & methodologies.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decolonized research methodologies aim to challenge existing power structures and amplify community voices, yet there is little guidance on their practical application. This study documents the methodological process, adaptations, and outcomes of applying decolonized research methods in a qualitative exploratory study on adolescent sexual and reproductive health in Freedom Park, South Africa. METHODS: This study is a methods documentation of lessons learned in an exploratory study. We applied a decolonized methodology, which incorporated elements of PAR, Indigenous, and co-design research approaches, engaging a Community Advisory Committee to collaboratively design research and data collection methods. RESULTS: We used the research processes of this study to demonstrate how decolonized methodologies can be applied and integrated into research. The Community Advisory Committee's involvement resulted in a unique adaptation of body mapping that was culturally relevant, and prioritized anonymity, community context, and participant comfort. The research process emphasized reciprocity, non-hierarchical collaboration, and collective knowledge production, challenging traditional Western research paradigms. Participants were highly engaged, and the adapted method facilitated open discussions on sexual and reproductive health topics that might otherwise be stigmatized. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates how decolonized methodologies can be effectively implemented through community co-design, centering local knowledge while addressing power imbalances in research. The findings highlight the importance of self-determination in research design and the potential for adapted participatory methods to enhance data validity and community impact. Future research should continue to explore and document practical applications of decolonized methodologies to inform ethical and contextually appropriate research practices.",
