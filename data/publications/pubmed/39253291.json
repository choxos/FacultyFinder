  "title": "Canadian Veterans' Experiences of Living with Chronic Pain: A Descriptive Qualitative Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An estimated 30% of veterans live with chronic pain, compared to 20% of Canadians in the general population. Veterans face health care challenges upon release from the military, increasing difficulties in obtaining chronic pain care. AIMS: We explored experiences of Canadian Armed Forces veterans living with chronic pain, their transition from military to civilian care, perceived barriers and facilitators to chronic pain care, and impacts of their pain on the domains of well-being. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semistructured interviews. We used a deductive/inductive approach to derive themes and concepts from interview transcripts. RESULTS: Thirty-five veterans living with chronic pain participated. Participants reported that pain affected their lives in numerous ways, including negatively impacting relationships and limiting activities of daily living and leisure. They identified barriers to care, including lack of access to family doctors or health care services, reluctance to ask for help, and challenges in obtaining coverage for services from Veterans Affairs Canada. Facilitators included support from other veterans and online resources. Chronic pain had bidirectional effects on domains of well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of pain varied among Canadian veterans, and military culture played a role in perceptions and management of pain. Barriers and facilitators to chronic pain care were highlighted from their time in the military into their transition to civilian care. Participants described the impact of chronic pain on their overall well-being. Determining whether these findings are relevant to a larger population of Canadian veterans will be important for future research and knowledge translation to improve chronic pain care for Canadian veterans.",
