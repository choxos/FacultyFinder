  "title": "Assessment of DNA oxidation and antioxidant activity in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease.",
  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the oxidative DNA damage, antioxidant activity, and effects of antihypertensive drugs on oxidative stress in hypertensive patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Fifty-three non-dialyzed hypertensive CKD patients were included by the study. Serum and urinary 8-hydroxydeoxy guanosine (8-OHdG) levels (as a marker of oxidative DNA damage), serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (G-Px) activities (as antioxidant enzymes) were measured. SOD activity was higher and G-Px activity was lower in the patient group as compared to control group. Serum and urinary 8-OHdG levels were found to be higher in the patients with proteinuria greater than 3 g/day than those in the patients with proteinuria less than 3 g/day. It has been determined that G-Px activity and urinary 8-OHdG level were lower in the patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor compared to patients treated with calcium channel blocker. The present data show oxidative DNA damage at a higher level in the patients with proteinuria greater than 3 g/day. In comparison to a calcium channel blocker, an ACE inhibitor seems much more protective against oxidative DNA damage in hypertensive patients with different stages of CKD.",
