  "title": "Validity of the Stage of Exercise Scale in Children with Rheumatologic Conditions.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the face, content, and construct validity of the Stages of Exercise Scale (SOES) in children with rheumatologic conditions [juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM)], and if the validity of the SOES differs by disease type by comparing it with a disease control with a chronic respiratory illness [cystic fibrosis (CF)]. METHODS: Sixty-seven children and adolescents (43 female) ages 11 to 18 years with a diagnosis of either JDM (n = 15), JIA (n = 39), or CF (n = 13) completed the SOES; scales of sensibility, process of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy; the Child Health Assessment Questionnaire; and patient/physician ratings of disease severity. Physical activity was measured by an accelerometer. Relationships among SOES and measured constructs were determined by ANOVA and with logistical modeling. RESULTS: SOES, decisional balance, and self-efficacy as well as behavioral and cognitive processes from the process of change demonstrated significant differences across the staging subgroups. Disease groups did not significantly differ on the scoring across the SOES. Children and adolescents in higher stages participated in more minutes of vigorous physical activity compared with those in the lower stages. CONCLUSION: The SOES demonstrated good face, content, and construct validity in children and adolescents with rheumatic disease.",
