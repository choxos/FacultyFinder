  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Acute pancreatitis (AP) following drug-induced hypertriglyceridemia is a rare clinical phenomenon. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment for a variety of solid organ and hematological malignancies. Pembrolizumab is a programmed cell death receptor-1 (PD-1) inhibitor that has shown promising responses in many advanced cancers. However, a constellation of immune-related adverse events has also been described. There are reports of pembrolizumab-induced hypertriglyceridemia, but AP as a result of this side effect remains an exceedingly rare clinical sequela. CASE REPORT: We delineate a case of a patient with stage IVB non-small-cell lung cancer who developed progressive abdominal pain and nausea following administration of pembrolizumab for four months. Laboratory studies revealed increased serum lipase and triglyceride levels at 12,562 IU/L and 16,901 mg/dL, respectively. The diagnosis of AP was made based on the revised Atlanta classification criteria. After ruling out alternative causes, pembrolizumab-induced hypertriglyceridemia was considered the likely etiology of AP. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: The patient was transferred to the medical intensive care unit for close monitoring. Treatment was initiated with intravenous fluids, pain medications, and an insulin infusion. However, her hypertriglyceridemia levels remained persistently elevated, necessitating therapeutic apheresis. She recovered well with no complications after triglyceride apheresis. DISCUSSION: AP following pembrolizumab-associated hypertriglyceridemia remains a rare clinicopathologic entity. Given the widespread clinical use of immune checkpoint inhibitors, knowledge of such rare adverse events is crucial. Evaluation of serum triglyceride levels before and after initiating pembrolizumab therapy may be mandated, especially in patients with metabolic comorbidities.",
