  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This article utilizes an adapted model for research transfer to highlight the important role of Local Public Health Agencies (LPHAs) to share data more effectively with local community organizations to advance health equity. METHODS: A literature review related to public health data sharing with local community partners was conducted using Medline, Embase, and CINAHL databases and grey literature sources with 12 articles included for analysis. Six LPHAs distributed an online survey to 405 local community organizations to define their current data uses and needs. Survey and literature review findings informed a one-day deliberative dialogue event with 19 participants who brought multiple perspectives together on the barriers and potential solutions for data sharing. RESULTS: Results are discussed utilizing the three stages of data sharing: awareness, communication, and collaboration. Awareness of the barriers and needs of community partners related to data, and the public health core competency of assessment and analysis is the first stage. More effective is the second stage, where LPHAs proactively communicate to understand and meet the needs of community partners. Data sharing is the most effective when LPHAs use the third stage of collaboration to work with community partners to mutually benefit from data sharing. CONCLUSION: When LPHAs utilize their core competencies of assessment and analysis, communication, and collaboration to share data with community partners, they are able to share data more effectively. This allows community partners to modify programs to better serve priority populations and improve population health.",
