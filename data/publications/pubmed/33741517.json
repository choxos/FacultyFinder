  "title": "Exposure to aluminium causes behavioural alterations and oxidative stress in the brain of adult zebrafish.",
  "abstract": "Aluminium (Al) water pollution is an increasing environmental problem. Accordingly, this study aimed to find out more about its toxic effects on aquatic organisms. Adult zebrafish were exposed to 11 mg/L of Al and the behavioural responses and its correlation with brain oxidative stress, antioxidant-defences, changes in metabolism and neurotransmission were assessed at 10, 15 and 20 days of exposure. The behavioural and locomotory responses, suggest an increase in the anxiety state, especially observed in animals exposed to Al for 15 days. The reactive oxygen species increased in a time-dependent trend, while the oxidative damage varied over exposure time. The activity of antioxidant enzymes, as superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferases, and the metallothioneins levels increased after short-term exposures and tended to decrease or stabilize at longer times. The results contribute to understand the toxic mechanisms activated by Al highlighting correlations like behavioural disorders and oxidative state.",
