  "title": "[Photobiomodulation and vulvovaginal disorders after anticancer treatments].",
  "abstract": "Anticancer treatments induce vulvovaginal complications that alter the quality of life and sexuality of patients. New technologies, such as photobiomodulation, could address this problem, for which few effective therapeutic solutions exist. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients seeking treatment and to observe the effects of photobiomodulation. This is a prospective cohort of patients treated for cancer, in failure of first-line medical treatment, managed at the University Hospital of Nîmes. The history, symptoms and impact of the disorders on their quality of life were collected. At follow-up, improvement was assessed using the PGI-I and FSFI questionnaires. Twenty-eight patients were treated. They were all menopausal, half of them after anticancer treatments [chemotherapy (78%), radiotherapy (36%), hormone therapy (36%)]. The main symptom reported was vaginal dryness (72%). Seventy-one percent of patients (n=20) felt that their daily life was affected≥8/10. All patients had sexual dysfunction. Twenty-two patients received at least 6 sessions of photobiomodulation. Seventy-two percent (n=18) of patients felt better or much better after treatment (PGI-I≤2). The median improvement estimated by the patients was 65% (Q1=50%; Q3=72.5%). There was also a significant clinical improvement. No serious adverse events were reported. Due to the small number of patients in a heterogeneous population with no control group, we cannot extrapolate our results. However, the objective was to assess the status of these pathologies and the contribution of photobiomodulation in patients who have failed first-line treatment; and these results are encouraging.",
