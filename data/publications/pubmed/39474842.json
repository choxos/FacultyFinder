  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to assess whether early surgical intervention for first-time patellar dislocations in paediatric patients is superior to conservative management. We hypothesized that surgical intervention would lead to lower redislocation rates compared to conservative treatment. METHODS: Three online databases (PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE) were searched from inception to 14 March 2024 to identify studies investigating the management options for acute first-time patellar dislocations in paediatric patients. Data pertaining to patient demographics, patient management, redislocation rates and Kujala scores, evaluating function, were abstracted. Weighted means and meta-analyses were conducted to compare rates of redislocation, as well as Kujala scores. The quality of included studies was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomized studies criteria for non-randomized studies and the ROB2 tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RESULTS: A total of 11 studies and 761 patients were included in this review. The weighted mean post-operative combined rates of redislocation in the surgical group was 25.1%, compared to 46.4% in the conservative group at a mean follow-up of 53.2 months (12-168). The relative risk (RR) of redislocation was 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.65-1.04, I[2] = 0%, p = 0.11), favouring surgery compared to conservative management. A subgroup meta-analysis of two recent RCTs with 110 patients demonstrated an RR of redislocation of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.31-0.91, I[2] = 0%, p = 0.02), favouring surgery. Kujala scores among three comparative studies showed a mean difference of -2.7 (95% CI: -6.1 to 0.68, I[2] = 0%, p = 0.12), favouring conservative treatment. The weighted mean redislocation rate in 131 patients undergoing medial patellofemoral ligament reconstruction (MPFLR) was 3.1%, compared to 39.4% in 203 patients undergoing other surgical procedures, such as lateral release and medial imbrication, Roux-Goldwaith and MPFL repair. Furthermore, the conservative groups experienced a complication rate of 0.9% compared to 2.9% across the surgical groups. CONCLUSION: Surgical management for first-time patellar dislocations in a paediatric population, particularly MPFLR, may be more beneficial in lowering redislocation rates than conservative management. No significant differences in Kujala scores were found. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.",
