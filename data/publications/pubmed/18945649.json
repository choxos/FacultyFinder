  "abstract": "The development of a reliable sensitive method for the HPLC determination of 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and ALA esters in cell lysates is described. The method relies on the quantification of a fluorescent derivative of ALA following its derivatisation with acetylacetone and formaldehyde. Following this procedure it is possible to quantify ALA in cell lysates with no need for pre-purification of the sample. The method has been validated in two ranges of concentration (0.6-65 microM, 0.1-10 microg/mL, and 30-600 microM, 5-100 microg/mL), and has also been extended and validated for the determination of ALA released from ALA prodrugs after acidic hydrolysis.",
