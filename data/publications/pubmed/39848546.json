  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using mobile application (app) technology for monitoring recovery after knee osteotomy and to determine the time required for patients to return to their preoperative step counts. METHODS: This retrospective study included 329 patients who underwent coronal realignment surgery, including high tibial osteotomy (HTO) or distal femoral osteotomy (DFO) with a minimum follow-up of 1 year. The patients were grouped based on the type of osteotomy performed, i.e., HTO and DFO groups. Step count data were collected using the myrecovery app and analyzed preoperatively and at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively. Statistical analyses included univariate linear regression models to assess the relationship between step counts at each time point and the duration required to return to their preoperative step counts. RESULTS: Of the 329 patients included in the study, a total of 62 patients (19%) downloaded the app and 24 patients (7%) had complete step count data. Of the 24 patients with complete data, 18 were included in the HTO group and 6 were included in the DFO group. It took patients an average of 153 ​± ​112 days to return to their preoperative step counts, with the patients in the HTO group taking 174 ​± ​121 days and those in the DFO group taking 113 ​± ​77 days. Step counts increased significantly over time, with percentages of preoperative step counts reaching 108% at 12 months postoperatively. A statistically significant correlation was found between step counts at 3 months postoperatively and the time to return to preoperative step counts (R[2] ​= ​0.240, P ​= ​0.015). DISCUSSION: This study found that patients took approximately 5 months to return to their preoperative step counts after knee osteotomy. However, the adoption of the app was limited, with only 19% of patients downloading the app and just 7% providing complete data, posing a significant barrier to the feasibility of mobile apps for tracking recovery. CONCLUSION: The mobile app is effective for tracking recovery progress following knee osteotomy, but strategies to increase patient adoption are essential for enhancing its practical application.
