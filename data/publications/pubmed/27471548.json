  "abstract": "This letter intends to clarify information and misconceptions found in the article \"Syrian refugees in Lebanon: the search for universal health coverage\" which was published June 1st, 2016, and to challenge the core notion of fragmentation as presented by the authors. It also highlights the fact that the article does not recognize the severe shortage in refugees health financing and unmet promises by the international community, and calls for immediate action and far greater support from that community to address the needs of refugees in Lebanon.",
