  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To estimate the regression, persistence, and progression of untreated cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2) lesions managed conservatively as well as compliance with follow-up protocols. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from 1 January 1973 to 20 August 2016. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Studies reporting on outcomes of histologically confirmed CIN2 in non-pregnant women, managed conservatively for three or more months. DATA SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Random effects model was used to calculate pooled proportions for each outcome, and heterogeneity was assessed using I[2] statistics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of regression, persistence, or progression of CIN2 and default rates at different follow-up time points (3, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 60 months). RESULTS: 36 studies that included 3160 women were identified (seven randomised trials, 16 prospective cohorts, and 13 retrospective cohorts; 50% of the studies were at low risk of bias). At 24 months, the pooled rates were 50% (11 studies, 819/1470 women, 95% confidence interval 43% to 57%; I[2]=77%) for regression, 32% (eight studies, 334/1257 women, 23% to 42%; I[2]=82%) for persistence, and 18% (nine studies, 282/1445 women, 11% to 27%; I[2]=90%) for progression. In a subgroup analysis including 1069 women aged less than 30 years, the rates were 60% (four studies, 638/1069 women, 57% to 63%; I[2]=0%), 23% (two studies, 226/938 women, 20% to 26%; I[2]=97%), and 11% (three studies, 163/1033 women, 5% to 19%; I[2]=67%), respectively. The rate of non-compliance (at six to 24 months of follow-up) in prospective studies was around 10%. CONCLUSIONS: Most CIN2 lesions, particularly in young women (<30 years), regress spontaneously. Active surveillance, rather than immediate intervention, is therefore justified, especially among young women who are likely to adhere to monitoring.
