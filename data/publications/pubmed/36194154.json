  "abstract": "Tuberculosis is difficult to treat due to dormant cells formed in response to immune stress and stochastically formed persisters, both of which are tolerant of antibiotics. Bactericidal antibiotics kill by corrupting their energy-dependent targets. We reasoned that stochastic variation, or noise, in the expression of an energy-generating component will produce rare persister cells. In sorted M. tuberculosis cells grown on acetate, there is considerable cell-to-cell variation in the level of mRNA coding for AckA, the acetate kinase. Quenching the noise by overexpressing ackA sharply decreases persisters, showing that it acts as the main persister gene under these conditions. This demonstrates that a low energy mechanism is responsible for the formation of M. tuberculosis persisters. Entrance into a low-energy state driven by noise in expression of energy-producing enzymes is likely a general mechanism by which bacteria produce persisters. IMPORTANCE M. tuberculosis infection requires the administration of multiple antibiotics for a prolonged period of time. Treatment difficulty is generally attributed to M. tuberculosis entrance into a nonreplicative, antibiotic-tolerant state. M. tuberculosis enters this nonreplicative state in response to immune stress. However, a small population of cells enter a nonreplicative, multidrug-tolerant state under normal growth conditions, absent any stress. These cells are termed persisters. The mechanisms by which persisters enter a nonreplicative state are largely unknown. Here, we show that, as with other bacteria, M. tuberculosis persisters are low-energy cells formed stochastically during normal growth. Additionally, we identify the natural variation in the expression of energy producing genes as a source of the stochastic entrance of M. tuberculosis into the low-energy persister state. These findings have important implications for understanding the heterogeneous nature of M. tuberculosis infection and will aid in designing better treatment regimens against this important human pathogen.",
