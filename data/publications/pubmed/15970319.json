  "title": "The dimensions of maltreatment: introduction.",
  "abstract": "This special issue includes an introduction and seven papers exploring dimensions of maltreatment including type, severity, chronicity, and substantiation status of referrals to CPS, utilizing a subsample of the LONGSCAN studies. Each paper examines one of the dimensions of maltreatment from various perspectives to determine if different conceptualizations of a dimension, examined in isolation, account for different amounts of variation in child outcomes. A final paper assesses the relationship of the combined maltreatment dimensions, including interactions, on a single sample of maltreated children from the LONGSCAN study. This final paper explores the individual contribution of the \"best\" conceptualizations of the maltreatment dimensions in relation to each other, and to the 10 child outcomes of interest. Implications of the findings from these papers for future research on dimensions of child maltreatment are discussed in two independent commentaries.",
