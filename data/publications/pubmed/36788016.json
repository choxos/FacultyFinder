  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The measure of serum proteome in the preclinical state of Crohn's disease (CD) may provide insight into biological pathways involved in CD pathogenesis. We aimed to assess associations of serum proteins with future CD onset and with other biomarkers predicting CD risk in a healthy at-risk cohort. DESIGN: In a nested case-control study within the Crohn's and Colitis Canada Genetics Environment Microbial Project (CCC-GEM) cohort, which prospectively follows healthy first-degree relatives (FDRs), subjects who developed CD (n=71) were matched with four FDRs remaining healthy (n=284). Using samples at recruitment, serum protein profiles using the Olink Proximity Extension Assay platform was assessed for association with future development of CD and with other baseline biomarkers as follows: serum antimicrobial antibodies (AS: positive antibody sum) (Prometheus); faecal calprotectin (FCP); gut barrier function using the fractional excretion of lactulose-to-mannitol ratio (LMR) assay. RESULTS: We identified 25 of 446 serum proteins significantly associated with future development of CD. C-X-C motif chemokine 9 (CXCL9) had the highest OR with future risk of CD (OR=2.07 per SD, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.73, q=7.9e-5), whereas matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein had the lowest OR (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.66, q=0.02). Notably, CXCL9 was the only analyte significantly associated with all other CD-risk biomarkers with consistent direction of effect (FCP: OR=2.21; LMR: OR=1.67; AS: OR=1.59) (q<0.05 for all). CONCLUSION: We identified serum proteomic signatures associated with future CD development, reflecting potential early biological processes of immune and barrier dysfunction.",
