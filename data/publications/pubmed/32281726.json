  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Web-Accessible Population Pharmacokinetic Service (WAPPS) project generates individually predicted pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles and tailored prophylactic treatment regimens for haemophilic patients, which rely on a set of population PK (PopPK) models providing concentrate-specific priors for the Bayesian forecasting methodology. AIM: To describe the predictive performance of the WAPPS PopPK models in use on the WAPPS-Hemo platform. METHODS: Data for modelling include dense PK data obtained from industry sponsored and independent PK studies, and dense and sparse data accumulated through WAPPS-Hemo. WAPPS PopPK models were developed via non-linear mixed-effect modelling taking into account the effects of covariates and between-individual-and sometimes between-occasion-variability. Model evaluation consisted of (a) prediction-corrected Visual Predictive Check (pcVPC), (b) Limited Sampling Analysis (LSA) and (c) repeated hold-out cross-validation. RESULTS: Thirty-three WAPPS PopPK models built on data from 3188 patients (ages 1-78 years) under treatment by factor VIII or IX products (FVIII, FIX) were evaluated. Overall, models exhibit excellent performance characteristics. The pcVPC shows that the observed PK data fall within acceptable 90% interpercentile predictive bands. A slight overprediction beyond the expected half-life, an anticipated result of using sparse data, occurs for some models. The LSA results in lower than 3% of relative error for FVIII and FIX products and 16% for engineered FIX products. Cross-Validation analysis yields relative errors lower than 1.5% and 1.4% in estimates of half-life and time to 0.02 IU/mL, respectively. CONCLUSION: The WAPPS-Hemo models consistently showed excellent performance characteristics for the intended use for Bayesian forecasting of individual PK profiles.",
