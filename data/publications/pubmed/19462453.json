  "abstract": "Predicting patient outcome for colorectal carcinoma (CRC) with lymph node but not distant metastases remains challenging. Various prognostic markers have been identified including microsatellite instability (MSI) and possibly expression of the MHC Class II protein, HLA-DR. About 15% of sporadic CRC exhibits MSI associated with methylation of the DNA mismatch repair gene hMLH1 promoter. In addition, a significant proportion of unselected CRC demonstrates expression of HLA-DR. We sought to examine the relationship between HLA-DR expression, MSI status and prognosis in sporadic Australian Clinicopathological (ACP) Stage C CRC. Two hundred seventy consecutive patients with sporadic ACP Stage C CRC were treated at Concord Repatriation General Hospital between 1986 and 1992. None of these patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and all were followed for a minimum of 5 years or until death. DNA was extracted from paraffin sections and MSI status determined by PCR. HLA-DR expression was determined immunohistochemically using an antibody against the HLA-DR alpha chain. MSI status could be assigned in 235 cases: 176 CRCs (74.9%) were microsatellite stable, whereas 23 (9.8%) had high levels of MSI (MSI-H) and 36 (15.3%) had low levels of MSI (MSI-L). HLA-DR expression by CRC cells was seen in 148 (60.1%) cases and correlated with the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (p = 0.0005) and peritumoral lymphocytes (p = 0.003), but not other clinicopathological features or MSI status. HLA-DR-positive CRCs were strongly associated with better patient outcome (p < 0.0001).",
