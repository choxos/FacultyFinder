  "title": "Editorial Commentary: Hip Arthroscopy Outcomes in Older Patients Can Equal Outcomes in Younger Patients With Proper Surgical Indications.",
  "abstract": "Hip arthroscopy patients often present with clinical features that help broadly categorize them as the younger patient with femoroacetabular impingement, the microinstability- or instability-related patient, those patients with predominant peripheral compartment disease, and the older patient with femoroacetabular impingement plus peripheral compartment disease. Outcomes in older patients can equal outcomes in younger patients with proper surgical indications. Specifically, older hip arthroscopy patients do well in the absence of degenerative articular cartilage changes. Although some studies have suggested a potential for greater conversion rate to hip arthroplasty in an older age group, with proper patient selection, hip arthroscopy may lead to durable and significant improvements.",
