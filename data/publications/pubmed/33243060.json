  "title": "Frailty and Life-Space Mobility: Implications for Clinical Practice and Research.",
  "abstract": "Frailty is an important medical syndrome that can be prevented or treated with specific interventions. However, there is limited research evidence on multifactorial perspectives of frailty management and its impact on daily function including mobility declines and changes in life-space mobility. Using the person-environment-occupation (PEO) model we aim to describe the relationship between frailty and life-space mobility in older adults. This manuscript provides a new framework for clinical practice and research implications of frailty and life-space mobility in older adults including: (1) overview of key concepts, (2) application of the PEO model to describe how frailty (personal) and life-space (environmental) can influence occupational performance, and (3) clinical practice implications to improve frailty-related immobility. This new framework provides a starting point to extend the focus of frailty beyond the individual to encompass the environmental context within which people live and move.",
