  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the links of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) to treatment-induced signaling in breast cancer and to propose further studies to elucidate the role of NF-kappa B in breast cancer response to chemotherapy and radiation. RECENT FINDINGS: The authors' group and others have investigated the clinical relevance of ubiquitously expressed NF-kappa B in breast cancer. Possibly through its effects on apoptosis, NF-kappa B has been implicated in tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiation in many types of tumors. Furthermore, both in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that targeted inhibition of NF-kappa B can sensitize tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation. SUMMARY: The molecular mechanisms involved in chemotherapy-induced and radiation-induced cell death in breast cancer are not fully known, nor are the mechanisms of treatment resistance. NF-kappa B is a transcription factor for a number of genes involved in tumor progression and resistance to systemic therapies and is a major regulator of the apoptotic pathway. Gaining further insights into molecular factors such as NF-kappa B as biomarkers for treatment response may help clinicians predict treatment outcome and lead to the development of targeted therapeutics.",
