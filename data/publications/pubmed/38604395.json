  "title": "The impact of formaldehyde exposure on lung inflammatory disorders: Insights into asthma, bronchitis, and pulmonary fibrosis.",
  "abstract": "Lung inflammatory disorders are a major global health burden, impacting millions of people and raising rates of morbidity and death across many demographic groups. An industrial chemical and common environmental contaminant, formaldehyde (FA) presents serious health concerns to the respiratory system, including the onset and aggravation of lung inflammatory disorders. Epidemiological studies have shown significant associations between FA exposure levels and the incidence and severity of several respiratory diseases. FA causes inflammation in the respiratory tract via immunological activation, oxidative stress, and airway remodelling, aggravating pre-existing pulmonary inflammation and compromising lung function. Additionally, FA functions as a respiratory sensitizer, causing allergic responses and hypersensitivity pneumonitis in sensitive people. Understanding the complicated processes behind formaldehyde-induced lung inflammation is critical for directing targeted strategies aimed at minimizing environmental exposures and alleviating the burden of formaldehyde-related lung illnesses on global respiratory health. This abstract explores the intricate relationship between FA exposure and lung inflammatory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, allergic inflammation, lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis.",
