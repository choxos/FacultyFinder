  "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to discuss the design of a microfluidic chip consisting of columns, and its use for the enrichment of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) cells. A microfluidic chip experiment was simulated using FLUENT software. Within the microfluidic chip, aptamers were bound to the reaction chamber (consisting of columns) using a biotin-avidin system. Cell suspension was introduced into the reaction chamber to capture NPC cells. NPC cells were subsequently eluted, and the capture rate of the cells was calculated. The modified aptamer-bound microfluidic chip was able to capture NPC cells with a capture rate of ~90%. The modified aptamer-bound microfluidic chip has a wide range of potential applications for the diagnosis of NPC.",
