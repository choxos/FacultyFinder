  "title": "Multi-interfacial engineering in the hierarchical self-assembled micro-nano dielectric aerogel for wide-band absorption and low infrared emissivity.",
  "abstract": "Radar-infrared (IR) compatible stealth can satisfy the characteristics of excellent electromagnetic wave attenuation property and low infrared emissivity. However, concurrently satisfying these demands is still a great challenge at present. Herein, multi-interfacial engineering strategy was proposed for the preparation of radar-IR compatible stealth materials. ZnO has a high electron binding energy and a large band gap at room temperature, and doping with sulphide can increase the concentration of unconstrained carriers. Therefore, bimetallic sulphide aerogels loaded with ZnO were prepared by means of carbonization and vulcanization, combined with freeze-drying method. When the filling ratio is 20 %, an absorption bandwidth (fe) of 6.62 GHz at a matching thickness of 2.0 mm and a reduction in IR emissivity from 0.920 to 0.539 in the 8-14 Î¼m band are achieved. This work provides a guidance to design and synthesize high-performance absorbers by multi-interfacial engineering for IR-radar compatible stealth application.",
