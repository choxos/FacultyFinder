  "title": "The International Quotidian Dialysis Registry: annual report 2007.",
  "abstract": "In view of the need to study both intermediate and definitive outcomes associated with daily and extended-hours hemodialysis (HD), our group has undertaken the design and implementation of an international registry to collect data describing the treatments and outcomes of patients treated with these regimens. The International Quotidian Dialysis Registry began recruiting patients in June 2004. There are currently 229 patients enrolled in the registry, up from 199 last year. The projected growth is 2000 patients by 2008. This paper constitutes the third annual report of progress of patient and center recruitment, and includes descriptive data drawn from the 3 primary patient groups currently tracked by the registry: home nocturnal, home short-daily, and in-center short-daily HD. As the cohort grows, patients will be compared with control subjects drawn from their respective national registries, and comparative analyses will follow.",
