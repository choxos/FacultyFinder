  "title": "The Syndrome of Diabetic Amyotrophy: A Preventable Disaster?",
  "abstract": "Diabetic amyotrophy is a disabling syndrome that frequently has a difficult or delayed clinical recognition. It is characterised by lancinating pain followed by muscle weakness, usually in the hip and thigh. The disease predominantly occurs in elderly patients and causes significant morbidity. Although a detailed history and neurologic examinations are helpful, electrodiagnostic testing yields accurate diagnosis in most of the cases. Herein, we chronicle the case of a young patient who developed profound diabetic amyotrophy within five years after the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, this report highlights the preventive as well as therapeutic role of strict glycemic control, warranting population-based monitoring and education of patients for diabetic amyotrophy, especially in Pakistan.",
