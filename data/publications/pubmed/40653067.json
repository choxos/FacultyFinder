  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Decision-making regarding breech extremely preterm mode of birth is difficult. Seeming benefits with cesarean section in previous studies may have been due to other factors that had not been adequately accounted for. OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of cesarean section versus vaginal birth with neonatal outcomes among liveborn extremely preterm breech singletons who received active care at birth. STUDY DESIGN: This population-based cohort study included all liveborn breech singletons between 23 and 27 weeks' gestation from 2010 to 2022, who received active resuscitation including those who died in the resuscitation room. We excluded outborn infants and those with major congenital anomalies. Our primary outcome was a composite of death, severe neurological complications, or birth trauma (mainly intracranial or other hemorrhage). The primary analysis comparing infants born by cesarean section versus vaginally used a generalized estimating equation Poisson regression model; sensitivity analyses included propensity score matching. RESULTS: From the 3332 extremely preterm breech singletons, 83.4% (2778/3332) were born by cesarean section. The adjusted incidence of mortality/severe morbidity was lower in the cesarean section group than in the vaginal birth group (26.1% versus 33.7%, respectively, adjusted relative risk of 0.77, 95% confidence interval: 0.63, 0.95, with adjustment for 14 factors including gestational age at birth). The reduction in mortality/severe morbidity following cesarean section persisted: after propensity score matching (adjusted relative risk: 0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.53, 0.89), and in those receiving optimized perinatal care (all of: antenatal corticosteroids, antenatal magnesium sulfate, and deferred cord clamping) or likely in those without optimized perinatal care, and in the subgroups of singletons born early (23-24 weeks) or likely later (25-27 weeks). CONCLUSIONS: Extremely preterm breech singleton birth by cesarean section was associated a reduction in mortality/severe morbidity. This association was robust and consistently observed in analyses addressing potential confounding through different methods, and in clinical-relevant scenarios. Given that all three previous randomized controlled trials were stopped early due to recruitment challenges, this type of cohort data are the best available evidence for decision-making.",
