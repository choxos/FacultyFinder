  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine how preoperative health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is affected by the duration of the wait time (WT) for anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) once a decision is made to proceed with surgery. METHODS: This was a multi-centre prospective cohort study. One hundred and twenty-two patients 14 years of age and above waiting for ACLR completed the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) demographic, current health assessment and subjective knee evaluation (SKF) forms on the day of decision to operate and the day of surgery. Changes in scores were analyzed for the entire cohort, adjusted for WTs and a subset was compared for patients with isolated anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears and ACL tears with concurrent meniscal involvement. Changes in HRQoL scores from the day of the decision to operate to the 9-month postoperative appointments were also assessed. RESULTS: Energy/Fatigue (p < 0.05), Pain (p < 0.05), General Health (p < 0.05) and the IKDC-SKF Score (p < 0.05) significantly increased between the day of the decision to operate and the day of surgery. Only the change in IKDC-SKF score remained significantly higher after adjusting for WT. Baseline HRQoL scores significantly improved by the 9-month postoperative appointment. CONCLUSION: The length of time waiting for ACLR did not adversely influence HRQoL in this study. However, low preoperative HRQoL and the significant improvement in HRQoL of patients followed postoperatively suggest that timely surgery is beneficial for this patient population. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II.",
