  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk factors for candidaemia in babies admitted to a tertiary care hospital with neonatal sepsis. METHODS: This nested case control study was conducted in the Neonatal Unit of the department of Paediatrics, King Edward Medical University/Mayo Hospital, Lahore, from January 2017 to June 2018. A total of 350 neonates having sepsis according to the clinical case definition were enrolled in this study by non-probability convenient sampling. Blood culture for bacteria on first day and for candida on fifth day was sent. Patients were started antimicrobial therapy as per institutional policy on admission. All patients were followed for risk factors for development of candidaemia. Data was analyzed by SPSS 22.0, Odds ratio and logistic regression was used to determine the magnitude of risk factors. RESULTS: Among 350 septic neonates, 36 isolates were positive for Candida spp, constituting 10.2% of candidaemia among septic neonates. Necrotizing enterocolitis was found to be the significantly associated risk factor for development of candidaemia. CONCLUSIONS: Necrotizing enterocolitis was found to be an important risk factor for development of candidaemia among hospitalized septic neonates.",
