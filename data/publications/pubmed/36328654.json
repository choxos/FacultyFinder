  "title": "Trends in Heart Failure-Related Mortality Among Older Adults in the United States From 1999-2019.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The U.S. population is aging with concurrent increases in heart failure (HF) burden. However, HF-related mortality trends among adults ≥75 years have not been investigated. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the trends and regional differences in HF-related mortality among older adults in the United States. METHODS: Death certificates from the CDC WONDER (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wide-Ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research) database were examined from 1999 to 2019 for HF-related mortality in adults ≥75 years of age. Age-adjusted mortality rates (AAMRs) per 10,000 persons and annual percent change (APC) were calculated and stratified by year, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. RESULTS: Between 1999 and 2019, 5,014,919 HF-related deaths occurred among adults ≥75 years. The AAMR declined from 141.0 in 1999 to 108.3 in 2012 (APC: -2.1; 95% CI: -2.4 to -1.9), after which it increased to 121.3 in 2019 (APC: 1.7; 95% CI: 1.2-2.2). Men had consistently higher AAMR than women from 1999 (AAMR men: 158.3 vs women: 131.0) to 2019 (AAMR men: 141.1 vs women: 107.8). Non-Hispanic (NH) White adults had the highest overall AAMR (127.2), followed by NH Black (108.7), NH American Indian/Alaska Native (102.0), Hispanic or Latino (78.0), and NH Asian or Pacific Islander adults (57.1) AAMR also varied substantially by region (overall AAMR: Midwest 133.9; South: 119.2; West: 116.3; Northeast: 113.5), and nonmetropolitan areas had higher HF-related AAMR (147.0) than metropolitan areas (115.2). States in the top 90th percentile of HF-related AAMR were Mississippi, Oklahoma, West Virginia, Oregon, and Indiana, which had approximately double the AAMRs compared with states that fell into the lower 10th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: Following a period of steady decline, HF-related mortality in U.S. adults ≥75 years has increased since 2012. The highest AAMRs were observed among White adults and men, and among patients living in the Midwestern and nonmetropolitan United States. Targeted strategies are needed to prevent and treat HF among older adults to curb increasing levels of HF-related mortality.",
