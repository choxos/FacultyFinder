  "title": "Return to sport following arthroscopic Bankart repair: a systematic review.",
  "abstract": "HYPOTHESIS AND BACKGROUND: The purpose of this systematic review was to determine the return-to-sport rate following arthroscopic Bankart repair, and it was hypothesized that patients would experience a high rate of return to sport. METHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed databases were searched by 2 reviewers, and the titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened independently. The inclusion criteria were English-language studies investigating arthroscopic Bankart repair in patients of all ages participating in sports at all levels with reported return-to-sport outcomes. A meta-analysis of proportions was used to combine the rate of return to sport using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Overall, 34 studies met the inclusion criteria, with a mean follow-up time of 46 months (range, 3-138 months). The pooled rate of return to participation in any sport was 81% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-87%). In addition, the pooled rate of return to the preinjury level was 66% (95% CI, 57%-74%) (n = 1441). Moreover, the pooled rate of return to a competitive level of sport was 82% (95% CI, 79%-88%) (n = 273), while the pooled rate of return to the preinjury level of competitive sports was 88% (95% CI, 66%-99%). CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic Bankart repair yields a high rate of return to sport, in addition to significant alleviation of pain and improved functional outcomes in the majority of patients. However, approximately one-third of athletes do not return to their preinjury level of sports.",
