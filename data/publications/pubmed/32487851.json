  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed and have excellent short-term tolerability. Administrative database studies have highlighted that many diseases are associated with PPI therapy including pneumonia, fracture, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. This review therefore reviews the evidence of the risks and benefits of these drugs. RECENT FINDINGS: There is high-to-moderate quality evidence that PPIs are effective at treating many acid-related disorders. Recent randomized trials have suggested that the associations between PPIs and various diseases are likely to be related to bias and residual confounding and these drugs appear to be safe apart from a possible increased risk of enteric infections. SUMMARY: PPIs should be used at the lowest dose and for the shortest duration possible. They are still relatively well-tolerated drugs but should only be prescribed for proven indications.",
