  "title": "Targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapy for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.",
  "abstract": "Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a life-threatening thrombotic disorder associated with a severe deficiency of ADAMTS-13-the protease that cleaves von Willebrand factor. Plasma therapy is the current standard of care for managing acute episodes of TTP, which involves removing patient plasma and replacing it with donor plasma to raise the level of ADAMTS-13 activity. Recently, therapies aimed at replacing ADAMTS-13 have been investigated as possible substitutes or add-ons to plasma therapy for congenital and immune-mediated TTP. Enzyme replacement therapy provides recombinant ADAMTS-13 via intravenous (i.v.) infusion to restore enzyme activity. Recombinant ADAMTS-13-loaded platelets localize to the site of thrombus formation in a more concentrated manner than enzyme replacement or plasma therapy. ADAMTS-13-encoding messenger RNA aims to induce a steady supply of secreted protein and gene therapy is a potentially curative strategy. Overall, targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapies may provide better outcomes than plasma therapy by achieving higher levels of ADAMTS-13 activity and a more sustained response with fewer adverse events. Herein, we describe targeted ADAMTS-13 replacement therapies for the treatment of TTP and discuss the advantages and limitations of each approach.",
