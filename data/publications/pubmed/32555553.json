  "title": "Comparing Interventions for Management of Hot Flashes in Patients With Breast and Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analyses.",
  "abstract": "PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: Hot flashes are common and bothersome in patients with breast and prostate cancer and can adversely affect patients' quality of life. LITERATURE SEARCH: Databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effects of one or more interventions for hot flashes in patients with a history of breast or prostate cancer. DATA EVALUATION: Outcomes of interest included changes in hot flash severity, hot flash frequency, quality of life, and harms. Pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses were performed where feasible, with narrative synthesis used where required. SYNTHESIS: 40 RCTs were included. Findings from network meta-analysis for hot flash frequency suggested that several therapies may offer benefits compared to no treatment, but little data suggested differences between active therapies. Findings from network meta-analysis for hot flash score were similar. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Although many interventions may offer improvements for hot flashes versus no treatment, minimal data suggest important differences between therapies.
