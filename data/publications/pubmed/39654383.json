  "title": "Incidence and Predictors of Adverse Events Among Patients Awaiting Left Atrial Appendage Closure.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the optimal timing of left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) and whether scheduling delays increase the risk for adverse outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the incidence and predictors of adverse events among patients awaiting LAAC. METHODS: This single-center retrospective study assessed all patients who underwent LAAC from January 2017 to March 2020. The primary study endpoints were the rate and characteristics of adverse events occurring from the time of initial shared decision to pursue LAAC until the time of LAAC. Adverse events were defined as clinically significant bleeding or anemia, thromboembolic complications, or death. Patients were censored after successful closure or the first adverse event. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-five patients underwent LAAC with demographics notable for age 73.5 ± 8.1 years, 98 (37%) females, left ventricular ejection fraction 52.3% ± 10.4%, CHA2DS2-VASc 4.8 ± 1.4, and HAS-BLED 3.2 ± 1.2. Median time from shared decision to insurance approval and insurance approval to LAAC were 18 (IQR 28) and 44 (IQR 40) days, respectively. Seventeen (6%) patients suffered an adverse event, including 15 (88%) cases of bleeding or anemia and 2 (12%) cases of thromboembolism. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that increased time to LAAC (odds ratio [OR] 1.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.15, 1.50], p < 0.001) and higher HAS-BLED score (OR 1.67, CI [1.11, 2.59], p = 0.017) were associated with significantly increased risk for adverse events. CONCLUSION: Prolonged time to LAAC and higher HAS-BLED score portend an increased risk for adverse events while awaiting LAAC. Expedited closure is warranted in high-risk patients.",
