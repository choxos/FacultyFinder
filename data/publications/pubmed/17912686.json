  "title": "Biological control of terrestrial molluscs using Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita--progress and prospects.",
  "abstract": "Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita Schneider (Nematoda: Rhabditidae) is a nematode that parasitises a wide range of slug and snail species. It has been formulated into a biological control agent (Nemaslug) and was commercialised in 1994. It is now available in fourteen European countries. A review is given of all research on P. hermaphrodita, including basic biology, mass cultivation, formulation, host range, application strategies, field efficacy and effects on non-target organisms. The many critical gaps in present knowledge are highlighted, and future research is proposed that will lead to greater understanding of this unusual parasite and may enable its more widespread use in the management of mollusc pests.",
