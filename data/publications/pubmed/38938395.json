  "title": "Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Cardiovascular Outcomes of Preeclampsia Hospitalizations in the United States 2004-2019.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is associated with higher in-hospital cardiovascular events and mortality with known disparities by race/ethnicity, but data on the interaction between income and these outcomes remain limited. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated racial and socioeconomic disparities in cardiovascular outcomes of preeclampsia at delivery hospitalizations. METHODS: We analyzed National Inpatient Sample data using International Classification of Diseases-9th Revision/-10th Revision codes between 2004 and 2019. We identified a total of 2,436,991 delivery hospitalizations with preeclampsia/eclampsia as a primary diagnosis representing White (43.1%), Black (18.4%), Hispanic (18.7%), and Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI; 3.3%) women. We stratified the population based on median household income (low income, medium income, and high income). Logistic regression and propensity-matched analysis were used for reporting outcomes adjusted for age, hospital region, and baseline comorbidities. RESULTS: Black Hispanic, and A/PI women with preeclampsia had higher in-hospital mortality compared with White women across all groups ofÂ income. Hispanic women had lower odds of peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) compared with White women. A significant interaction effect was observed with race/ethnicity and median household income for in-hospital mortality and PPCM with preeclampsia. Furthermore, high-income Black women had higher odds of PPCM, stroke, acute kidney injury, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, and venous thromboembolism compared with low-income White women. CONCLUSIONS: Women with preeclampsia experience significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in inpatient mortality and cardiovascular outcomes at delivery. Across all income groups, Black, Hispanic, and A/PI women experience higher odds of in-hospital mortality compared with White women. Furthermore, high-income Black women had greater odds of many CV complications compared with low-income White women.",
