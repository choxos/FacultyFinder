  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The present study aims to determine the tumor-related, clinical, and demographic factors associated with extent of resection (EOR) and post-operative outcomes in JPA patients. METHODS: All patients with JPA, identified from a single-center brain tumour data base, were included in this retrospective analysis. Pre-operative MRI scans were reviewed by a single neurosurgeon blinded to the EOR. JPA cases that exhibited no residual tumor post-operatively were assigned to the GTR group, all other tumors were assigned to the <GTR group. Tumor-related, clinical and demographic variables as well as perioperative morbidities were compared between both groups. RESULTS: Of the 28 patients included, 15 had a GTR (46% male; median age: 7.5 years; range: 1.16-14.9) and 13 had <GTR (69.2% male; median age: 10.6 years; range: 0.66-17.68). Tumor location reached statistical significance, as there were significantly more cerebellar tumors in the GTR group (86.7%) compared to the <GTR group (38.5%) (p = 0.016). GTR cases had a significantly longer average follow-up interval (6.6 months) than <GTR cases (4.5 months) (p = 0.031). All demographic variables, clinical variables and tumor-related factors showed no significant differences between the two groups. There were no differences between GTR and <GTR cases in terms of perioperative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows other than location of the lesion in the cerebellum, demographic, clinical and tumor-related variables are not associated with EOR in children with JPA. GTR was associated with an extended follow-up interval but not with increased perioperative morbidities compared to those with <GTR.",
