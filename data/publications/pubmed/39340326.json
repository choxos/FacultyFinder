  "title": "Optimal blood pressure control with fewer antihypertensive medications: Achieved mostly in low-risk hypertensive patients.",
  "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that intensive blood pressure (BP) targets can be reached with less than two medications. This cross-sectional study, involving 4991 individuals from the Majiapu community, assessed the correlation between BP control and the burden of antihypertensive drugs. Participants on medication were categorized into controlled (BP < 140/90 mm Hg) and uncontrolled (BP â‰¥ 140/90 mm Hg) groups, with the former further divided into optimal (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) and good control (BP < 140/90 but >130/80 mm Hg) subgroups. Multivariate logistic regression analyzed factors affecting hypertension control across these BP categories. The study found that, 54% of participants had hypertension. Of those treated (62.5%), 55.7% achieved BP control, including 23.15% maintaining BP below 130/80 mm Hg. The average number of antihypertensive medications was 1.61 for the controlled group (with an average BP of 126.6/76 mm Hg) and 1.75 for the uncontrolled group (with an average BP of 150.6/84.0 mm Hg). Additionally, the average number of antihypertensive medications was 1.66 in the good control group and 1.55 in the optimal control group. The uncontrolled group had a higher mean systematic coronary risk estimation (SCORE) of 5.59, against 3.97 and 2.5 in the good and optimal control groups, respectively. Key factors linked to poor BP control included age over 65, male sex, obesity, and former smoking, whereas lipid-lowering medication use was associated with better control. In conclusions, patients needing fewer antihypertensive drugs to achieve stricter targets may have a lower risk profile. Notably, only a small proportion of treated patients are low-risk individuals who can easily achieve BP levels below 130/80 mm Hg.",
