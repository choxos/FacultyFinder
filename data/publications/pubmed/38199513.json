  "title": "Update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of infective endocarditis: A review.",
  "abstract": "Despite advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of infective endocarditis (IE), the burden of IE has remained relatively high over the past decade. With an ageing population and an increasing proportion of healthcare-associated IE, the epidemiology of IE has undergone significant changes. Staphylococcus aureus has evolved as the most common causative microorganism, even in most low- and middle-income countries. Several imaging modalities and novel microbiological tests have emerged to facilitate the diagnosis of IE. Outpatient parenteral antibiotic treatment and oral step-down antibiotic treatment have become new trends for the management of IE. Early surgical intervention, particularly within seven days, should be considered in cases of IE with appropriate surgical indications. We comprehensively review the updated epidemiology, microbiology, diagnosis, and management of IE.",
