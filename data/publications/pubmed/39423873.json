  "title": "The role of sirtuin 1 in ageing and neurodegenerative disease: A molecular perspective.",
  "abstract": "Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), an NAD+-dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of cellular processes linked to ageing and neurodegeneration. SIRT1 modulates various signalling pathways, including those involved in autophagy, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial function, which are critical in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the therapeutic potential of SIRT1 in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Preclinical studies have demonstrated that SIRT1 activators, such as resveratrol, SRT1720, and SRT2104, can alleviate disease symptoms by reducing oxidative stress, enhancing autophagic flux, and promoting neuronal survival. Ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of these SIRT1 activators, providing hope for future therapeutic strategies targeting SIRT1 in neurodegenerative diseases. This review explores the role of SIRT1 in ageing and neurodegenerative diseases, with a particular focus on its molecular mechanisms, therapeutic potential, and clinical applications.",
