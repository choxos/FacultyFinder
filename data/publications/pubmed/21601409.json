  "title": "A comparison of the safety of olanzapine and haloperidol in combination with benzodiazepines in emergency department patients with acute agitation.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pharmacologic management of the agitated emergency department patient is controversial. The combination of olanzapine + benzodiazepines is not recommended by the manufacturer, but a recent report suggested harm only if the patient was intoxicated. Whether this is also true for haloperidol + benzodiazepines is not known. OBJECTIVES: The measurement of vital signs and ethanol levels in patients who received haloperidol with or without benzodiazepines was compared to a previous analysis of patients who received olanzapine with or without benzodiazepines. METHODS: This is a structured retrospective chart review of patients who received parenteral haloperidol or parental olanzapine either with or without benzodiazepines. RESULTS: There were 96 patients (71 haloperidol, 25 olanzapine) who met inclusion criteria. No patient in the olanzapine + benzodiazepine group had hypotension, although one patient in the olanzapine-only group did (6.7%); 2 patients in the haloperidol + benzodiazepines group (5.1%) and 2 patients in the haloperidol-only group (6.3%) had hypotension. In alcohol-negative (ETOH-) patients, neither olanzapine alone nor olanzapine + benzodiazepines was associated with decreased oxygen saturations. In ETOH+ patients, olanzapine alone was not associated with decreased oxygen saturations, but olanzapine + benzodiazepines were associated with lower oxygen saturations than haloperidol + benzodiazepines. CONCLUSIONS: In this sample, olanzapine alone or with a benzodiazepine was not associated with more hypotension than haloperidol. However, olanzapine + benzodiazepines were associated with lower oxygen saturations than haloperidol + benzodiazepines in ETOH+ but not ETOH- patients. In patients with known alcohol ingestion, haloperidol, haloperidol + benzodiazepines, or olanzapine alone may be better choices for treatment of agitation.",
