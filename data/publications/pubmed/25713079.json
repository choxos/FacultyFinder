  "title": "A role for the tyrosine kinase Pyk2 in depolarization-induced contraction of vascular smooth muscle.",
  "abstract": "Depolarization of the vascular smooth muscle cell membrane evokes a rapid (phasic) contractile response followed by a sustained (tonic) contraction. We showed previously that the sustained contraction involves genistein-sensitive tyrosine phosphorylation upstream of the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROK) pathway leading to phosphorylation of MYPT1 (the myosin-targeting subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP)) and myosin regulatory light chains (LC20). In this study, we addressed the hypothesis that membrane depolarization elicits activation of the Ca(2+)-dependent tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2). Pyk2 was identified as the major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in response to membrane depolarization. The tonic phase of K(+)-induced contraction was inhibited by the Pyk2 inhibitor sodium salicylate, which abolished the sustained elevation of LC20 phosphorylation. Membrane depolarization induced autophosphorylation (activation) of Pyk2 with a time course that correlated with the sustained contractile response. The Pyk2/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitor PF-431396 inhibited both phasic and tonic components of the contractile response to K(+), Pyk2 autophosphorylation, and LC20 phosphorylation but had no effect on the calyculin A (MLCP inhibitor)-induced contraction. Ionomycin, in the presence of extracellular Ca(2+), elicited a slow, sustained contraction and Pyk2 autophosphorylation, which were blocked by pre-treatment with PF-431396. Furthermore, the Ca(2+) channel blocker nifedipine inhibited peak and sustained K(+)-induced force and Pyk2 autophosphorylation. Inhibition of Pyk2 abolished the K(+)-induced translocation of RhoA to the particulate fraction and the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-697 and Thr-855. We conclude that depolarization-induced entry of Ca(2+) activates Pyk2 upstream of the RhoA/ROK pathway, leading to MYPT1 phosphorylation and MLCP inhibition. The resulting sustained elevation of LC20 phosphorylation then accounts for the tonic contractile response to membrane depolarization.",
