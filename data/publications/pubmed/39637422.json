  "abstract": "Anaesthesiologists actively involved with COVID-19 are at increased risk for post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSS). We assessed the PTSD and possible determinants of anaesthesiologists in COVID-19 referral hospitals in the post-COVID-19 era with the validated PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ). A multicenter cross-sectional survey was conducted among anaesthesiologists working in the 7 COVID-19 referral university/tertiary hospitals during November 2022 (post-COVID-19 era) in Greece. PCL-5 is a 20-item, 5-point Likert scale self-report measure, scored in two different ways to ensure a provisional diagnosis of PTSS. Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) explores 3 main dimensions of personality, whereas the Lie (L) scale serves as a measure of \"dishonesty\". Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predicting factors of PTSS using the stepwise forward method. One hundred doctors (response rate 85%) from 7 hospitals (72% females, median age 46 [33-51.5] years) participated. The overall Cronbach's alpha for PCL-5 was 0.946. According to each scoring, 18% and 23% of responders were diagnosed with PTSS, respectively, while 7% were classified as suffering from probable PTSD. Interestingly, children (OR=0.17, p=0.048) and the satisfaction with job position (OR=0.211, p=0.024) exhibited a protective effect against PTSS. On the other hand, family obligations were identified as an aggravating factor (OR=4.274, p=0.026). Concerning personality traits, only neuroticism was identified as a statistically significant independent factor predicting PTSS (OR=1.524, p=0.001). Finally, job ranking was also a statistically significant independent factor predicting PTSS, with a 3 times risk augmentation for each level in the job hierarchy (from Residents towards Academics) (OR=3.034, p=0.022). In the post-COVID-19 era, up to 23% of Greek anaesthesiologists working in referral hospitals suffered from PTSS. Children and job satisfaction exhibited a protective role in contrast to higher ranks of the job hierarchy.",
