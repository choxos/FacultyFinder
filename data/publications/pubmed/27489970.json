  "title": "Charcot's Neuroarthropathy After Simultaneous Pancreas-Kidney TransplantA Case Report.",
  "abstract": "Simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplant (SPKT) is an accepted approach and the treatment of choice in patients with type 1 diabetes with accompanying end-stage renal disease. Charcot's neuroarthropathy of the foot (CN) is a fairly common and devastating complication found in patients with long-standing, mostly uncontrolled, diabetes. However, CN has also been identified as a posttransplant consequence of SPKT. Traditional postoperative immunosuppressive therapy, particularly the use of corticosteroids, is acknowledged as an additional risk factor for the development of de novo CN after SPKT. This article describes an unusual case of a patient who presented with full-blown CN deformity after SPKT.",
