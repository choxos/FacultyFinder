  "title": "Hypoglycemia spiking mortality syndrome in broilers with rickets and a subsequent investigation of feed restriction as a contributing factor.",
  "abstract": "Several cases of elevated mortality with neurologic signs in 14-to-16-day-old broilers were presented to the Poultry Diagnostic and Research Center from one local integrated company. Suspected of \"spiking mortality\" associated with hypoglycemia, blood glucose levels were <150 mg/dl overall, with several birds with blood glucose levels as low as 30 mg/dl. Tissues, submitted for histopathology, revealed rickets in 50% of the birds. Virus isolation and serology for reovirus and infectious bursal disease virus were negative. After evaluation of these cases, a brief investigation was conducted to determine the effects of feed restriction on the induction of rickets and resulting hypoglycemia. One-hundred 1-day-old broilers were randomly assigned to three treatment groups of: 1) ad libitum feed, 2) 25% restriction, and 3) 50% restriction. Restriction began on the fifth day of age and continued to 21 days of age. Samples collected during the course of the study included whole blood for blood glucose measurements and proximal tibiotarsus for histopathologic examination for rickets. We were unable to reproduce the clinical signs of spiking mortality, neurologic changes, or hypoglycemia experimentally. Histopathology of the growth plates of the proximal tibiotarsus did indicate mild changes consistent with rickets, but the changes were not significant between treatment groups.",
