  "title": "Evaluation of Virtual Care in Kidney Transplant Recipients in the Early Posttransplant Period.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Though virtual care was widely adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic, evidence to support its use in kidney transplant recipients early after transplantation is limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study comparing post kidney transplant outcomes in patients who received in-person transplant care before the COVID-19 pandemic with those who received mainly virtual transplant care during the COVID-19 pandemic. The usual-care group included 69 patients who received a kidney transplant from March 1, 2019 to September 1, 2019, and the virtual-care group included 64 patients who received a kidney transplant from September 1, 2020 to March 1, 2021. RESULTS: At 6 months, five patients in the usual-care group and three patients in the virtual-care group died. There was one graft loss and one episode of acute rejection in the usual-care group, and two episodes of acute rejection in the virtual-care group (p = 0.60). Estimated glomerular filtration rate was higher for patients in the virtual-care group (59 mL/min/1.73 m[2] vs. 52 mL/min/1.73 m[2], p = 0.046) and serum creatinine was not different (138 µmol/L vs. 127 µmol/L, p = 0.27). There was no difference in mean blood pressure or hospitalizations. CONCLUSION: Outcomes were similar among recipients of a kidney transplant prior to the COVID-19 pandemic when care was mainly in person and during the pandemic when care was mainly virtual, without a signal of harm. Patient and donor selection may have led to unmeasured differences between groups.",
