  "title": "The Emergence of Multiple Antibiotic Resistance in Culture Sensitivities of Post-surgical Patients in Lahore General Hospital, Lahore.",
  "abstract": "Objective The purpose of this study is to isolate the organisms which are developing resistance and to recognize the drugs against which resistance has emerged so that antibiotic policy can be formulated for the proper and effective use of antibiotics. Setting and design An observational study was conducted for a period of six months from July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 in LGH. Methods Statistics regarding the culture and sensitivity of the organisms isolated from different sources were collected from the surgery department. 195 cultural and sensitivity reports were analyzed for identification of genus/species of bacteria and sensitivity of the organism. Results Out of 195 culture reports, 124 showed significant growth of organisms exhibiting resistance to either single or multiple drugs. Escherichia and acinobactor was the most common organism isolated with a total of 30 each (24%, 24%), followed by pseudomonas 21 (17%), Klebsiella was 13 (10%), Proteus was 10 (8%), Methicillin-resistance Staph-aureus was seven (5%), Methicillin-sensitive Staph-aureus was five (4%), Staphylococcus epidermidis was four (3%), Providencia, Streptococci, Enterobacter species and Citrobacter species were one (1%). Maximum resistance was detected with frequently used first-line antimicrobials such as Ceftriaxone, ampicillin and Clavulanic acid. Least resistant were Azithromycin, Cefoxitin, Cefaclor among the gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. Conclusion Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was more against frequently used antibiotics that are accessible for an extended duration. Variation of resistance and sensitivity pattern with time is identified. Periodic AMR monitoring and rotation of antibiotics are suggested to restrict further emergence of resistance.",
