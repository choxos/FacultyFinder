  "abstract": "Neglect of vulnerable adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes has been well documented. It often presents first in the physical symptoms of decubitus ulcers, dehydration and urinary tract infections (UTIs). A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the relationship between neglect and 90-day mortality among LTC residents in Ontario. An index of neglect was created. Of 106,765 residents, more than one-quarter were found to have at least one indicator of neglect: 13.1% had decubitus ulcers, 13.5% had dehydration, 6.2% had a UTI. Residents who exhibited clinical signs of neglect had higher risks of death within 90 days, both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
