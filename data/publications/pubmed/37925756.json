  "abstract": "AIMS: To evaluate associations between 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitor (ABPM) data vs. single casual blood pressure (BP) and albuminuria in youth with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of youth with type 2 diabetes 10-<18 yrs. from the iCARE cohort. MAIN EXPOSURES: daytime HTN (+/- nocturnal), isolated nocturnal HTN and single casual BP. MAIN OUTCOME: non-orthostatic urine albumin: creatinine ratio (ACR) ≥ 3 mg/mmol and log-transformed urine ACR. Regressions evaluated associations between 1. HTN status based on ABPM and log-transformed urine ACR (continuous) and 2. ABPM-derived BP z-scores and casual BPcentiles and albuminuria status (categorical). RESULTS: Of 281 youth included, 19.6 % had daytime HTN (+/- nocturnal), and 28.5 % isolated nocturnal HTN on 24-h ABPM. In multivariate linear regression, HTN (ABPM) (ß = 0.553; p = 0.001), duration of diabetes (ß = 0.857; p = 0.02), HbA1c (ß = 1.172; p ≤0.0001) and ACEI/ARB use (ß = 3.94; p < 0.0001) were positively associated with log-transformed ACR; (R[2] = 0.184). In logistic regression analysis, all ABPM LMS z-scores were positively associated with albuminuria; casual BPcentile was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Youth with type 2 diabetes have high rates of HTN based on 24-ABPM data. ABPM-derived measures of BP are associated with albuminuria. These data support the routine use of ABPM devices to diagnose hypertension in youth with type 2 diabetes.",
