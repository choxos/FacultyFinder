  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study identified rates of long-term behavior problems in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI) compared to children with only orthopedic injuries and risk factors and correlates for new behavior problems following TBI. METHODS: Sample included children with severe TBI (n = 42), moderate TBI (n = 41), and orthopedic injuries only (ORTHO;n = 50). The baseline assessment measured child behavior, adaptation, and neuropsychological, academic, and family functioning. Follow-ups were conducted at 6 and 12 months and at an extended follow-up a mean of 4 years after injury. RESULTS: The prevalence of caseness, defined as elevated behavior problem ratings, was higher in one or both TBI groups than in the ORTHO group at each follow-up (e.g., 36% of severe TBI group, 22% of moderate TBI group, and 10% of ORTHO group at extended follow-up). Most instances of postinjury-onset caseness at the extended follow-up were evident within the first year after TBI. Predictors were severe TBI, socioeconomic disadvantage, and preinjury behavioral concerns. Concurrent correlates included weakness in working memory and adaptive behavior skills, poorer behavior and school competence, and adverse family outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Postinjury-onset caseness is persistent, risks are multifactorial, and correlates include child dysfunction and family sequelae.",
