  "abstract": "Capnocytophaga spp. have been implicated as putative periodontal pathogens associated with various periodontal diseases. Although the genus is known to contain five human oral isolates, accurate identification to species level of these organisms recovered from subgingival plaque has been hampered by the lack of a reliable method. Hence, most studies to date have reported these isolates as Capnocytophaga spp. Previous attempts at identification were based on biochemical tests; however, the results were inconclusive. Considering the differing virulence features of the respective isolates, it is crucial to identify these isolates to species level. The universal and conservative nature of the 16S rRNA gene has provided an accurate method for bacterial identification. The aim of this study was to identify Capnocytophaga spp. via restriction enzyme analysis of this gene (16S rRNA PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism). The results (backed up by 16S rRNA gene sequencing) showed that this method reliably identifies all named Capnocytophaga spp. to species level.",
