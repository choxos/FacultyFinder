  "title": "Mechanical properties and composition of carotid and femoral atherosclerotic plaques: A comparative study.",
  "abstract": "This study compares the mechanical properties of excised carotid and femoral human plaques and also develops a predictor of these properties based on plaque composition. Circumferential planar tension tests were performed on 24 carotid and 16 femoral plaque samples. Composition was characterised using Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. Stretch at failure, strength, and stiffness are significantly higher in the carotid group (P=.012, P<.001 and P=.002, respectively). The ratio of calcified to lipid plaque content demonstrates the strongest correlation with the stretch at failure and strength (R[2]=.285, P<.001 and R[2]=.347, P<.001). No composition based parameter correlates significantly with stiffness. The significantly different mechanical properties of the two groups aids in explaining the varying endovascular treatment outcomes clinically observed in these vessels. Furthermore, determining the ratio of calcified to lipid plaque content may be useful in predicting individual plaque mechanical response to endovascular treatment.",
