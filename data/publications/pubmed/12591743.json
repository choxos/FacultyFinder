  "title": "Expression of the CD44v2-10 isoform confers a metastatic phenotype: importance of the heparan sulfate attachment site CD44v3.",
  "abstract": "We expressed the full-length CD44v2-10 isoform in SKHep1 cells, a nonmetastatic human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line that does not express any endogenous CD44v isoforms. In SCID mice, expression of CD44v2-10 by SKHep1 cells had no effect on s.c. primary tumor development but caused pulmonary metastases in 41% (7 of 17) of animals compared with control SKHep1 cells (0 of 16; P < 0.01). CD44v2-10 expression by SKHep1 cells resulted in enhanced heparan sulfate (HS) attachment and an enhanced capacity to bind heparin-binding growth factors. Mutation of the v3 domain to prevent HS attachment and growth factor binding abolished the metastatic phenotype, demonstrating that HS modification of CD44v2-10 plays a critical role in the development of metastases in this model. However, in vitro proliferation, motility, and invasion were not altered by CD44v2-10 expression.",
