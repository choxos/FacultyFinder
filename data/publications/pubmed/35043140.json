  "title": "HbA1c Reduction in Dulaglutide-Treated Patients Irrespective of Duration of Diabetes, Microvascular Disease, and BMI: A Post Hoc Analysis From the REWIND Trial.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate participant characteristics and long-term changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in patients treated with dulaglutide 1.5 mg in a post hoc analysis of the Researching cardiovascular Events with a Weekly INcretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Change from baseline in HbA1c was assessed during and up to 72 months of treatment before and after adjustment for duration of diabetes, prior microvascular disease (nephropathy or retinopathy), and BMI. Slope analyses were used to assess the change in HbA1c during 0-12 months and 12-72 months of therapy. RESULTS: HbA1c was significantly reduced in patients treated with dulaglutide compared with placebo during 72 months of treatment (least-squares mean difference = -0.61%, P < 0.001), regardless of diabetes duration, prior microvascular disease, and BMI (all interaction P > 0.07). Significant reductions were apparent at all time points and were independent of these baseline characteristics. Slope analyses revealed that the dulaglutide group experienced a higher rate of HbA1c reduction compared with the placebo group from 0 to 12 months before and after adjustment. The dulaglutide group also experienced a higher rate of HbA1c increase from 12 to 72 months compared with the placebo group that became nonsignificant after adjustment for diabetes duration, prior microvascular disease, and BMI combined. Despite the greater rate of HbA1c increase in the dulaglutide group during this period, mean HbA1c values remained below baseline in the dulaglutide group and below mean HbA1c values in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: Dulaglutide 1.5-mg treatment was statistically associated with a long-lasting decrease in HbA1c over 72 months, irrespective of baseline duration of diabetes, microvascular disease, and BMI.",
