  "title": "Terrain effect on atmospheric process in seasonal ozone variation over the Sichuan Basin, Southwest China.",
  "abstract": "Terrain effect is challenging for understanding atmospheric environment changes under complex topography. This study targets the Sichuan Basin (SCB), a deep basin isolated by plateaus and mountains in Southwest China, by employing WRF-Chem with integrated process rates (IPR) analysis to characterize the terrain-driven seasonal variations of tropospheric ozone (O3) with atmospheric physical and chemical processes. Results show that the basin terrain exerts reversed impacts on regional air quality changes by aggravating summertime and alleviating wintertime near-surface O3 with the relative contributions oscillating seasonally between -40% and 40% in SCB. Similarly, a seasonal shift of vertical O3 structures is dominated by summertime positive and wintertime negative changes in the lower troposphere induced by basin terrain. The key contributions of atmospheric process to near-surface O3 are identified with vertical and horizontal transport, which is dominated by basin terrain with intensifying seasonal and diurnal variations. With the existence of basin, the daytime O3 productions at the near-surface layer are elevated in months of warm seasons (April and July) but inhibited in the cold seasons (October and January), presenting a seasonal transition of primary factor from meteorology to aerosol-radiation forcing on photochemical reactions. Driven by plateau-basin thermodynamic forcing, horizontal O3 transport between the SCB and eastern TP is enhanced by mountain-plains solenoid (MPS), and even nocturnal O3-rich layers contribute to the impacts of vertical exchange on near-surface O3 levels. The terrain effects of deep basin under the interaction of Asian monsoons and westerlies could jointly change atmospheric physical and chemical processes to construct the seasonal and diurnal O3 evolution patterns over the SCB region.",
