  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The use of adjuvant chemotherapy to treat adults with localized resectable soft-tissue sarcoma remains controversial. The objective of this systematic review was to update the 1997 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reassess the efficacy of doxorubicin-based chemotherapy with respect to recurrence and survival. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify RCTs of adjuvant chemotherapy for adult patients diagnosed with localized resectable soft-tissue sarcoma. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility and quality of the studies using a modified version of the Detsky Quality Scale. The outcome measures were local, distant, and overall recurrence and survival calculated through the fixed effect or random effect model. RESULTS: Four new eligible trials were identified allowing for a total of 18 trials representing 1953 patients to be included in the analysis. The odds ratios (OR) for local recurrence was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.56-0.94; P = .02) in favor of chemotherapy. For distant and overall recurrence the OR was 0.67 (95% CI 0.56-0.82; P = .0001) in favor of chemotherapy. In terms of survival, doxorubicin alone had an OR of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.68-1.03; P = .09), which as not statistically significant. However, the OR for doxorubicin combined with ifosfamide was 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36-0.85; P = .01) in favor of chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: This updated meta-analysis confirms the marginal efficacy of chemotherapy in localized resectable soft-tissue sarcoma with respect to local recurrence, distant recurrence, overall recurrence, and overall survival. These benefits are further improved with the addition of ifosfamide to doxorubicin-based regimens, but must be weighed against associated toxicities.",
