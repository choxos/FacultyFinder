  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish the feasibility of an intervention consisting of neuromuscular exercise, mind-body techniques, and pain neuroscience education (PNE), referred to as Pain Informed Movement in people with knee Osteoarthritis (KOA). This program has the potential to improve our understanding of intrinsic pain modulation and its role in the management of chronic pain. METHODS: This was a single-arm feasibility trial with a nested qualitative component. Primary outcome: complete follow-up. Inclusion criteria: age ≥40 years, KOA clinical diagnosis or meeting KOA NICE criteria, and pain intensity ≥3/10. The program consisted of 8-week in-person and at-home exercise sessions. PNE and mind-body techniques were provided as videos and integrated into the exercise sessions. Participants completed questionnaires and physical assessments including blood draws at baseline and program completion. Secondary feasibility outcomes: acceptability of the intervention, burden, rates of recruitment, compliance and adherence, and adverse events. A priori success criteria were identified. Participants were invited to an online focus group. RESULTS: 19 participants were enrolled, with a complete follow-up rate of 74% (mean age 63.3 years (SD 10.5), 73% female), indicating modifications were necessary to proceed. All other success criteria were met. The focus groups revealed that the video content pertaining to the mind-body techniques would benefit from on screen demonstrations. CONCLUSION: The Pain Informed Movement program is deemed feasible, with minor modifications needed to proceed. A pilot two-arm RCT will be conducted to establish the feasibility and explore potential effects of Pain Informed Movement compared to conventional neuromuscular exercise and standard OA education.",
