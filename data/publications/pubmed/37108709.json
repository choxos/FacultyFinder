  "title": "Sickle Cell Hemoglobin Genotypes Affect Malaria Parasite Growth and Correlate with Exosomal miR-451a and let-7i-5p Levels.",
  "abstract": "Malaria affects a significant portion of the global population, with 247 million cases in 2021, primarily in Africa. However, certain hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell trait (SCT), have been linked to lower mortality rates in malaria patients. Hemoglobin (Hb) mutations, including HbS and HbC, can cause sickle cell disease (SCD) when both alleles are inherited (HbSS and HbSC). In SCT, one allele is inherited and paired with a normal allele (HbAS, HbAC). The high prevalence of these alleles in Africa may be attributed to their protective effect against malaria. Biomarkers are crucial for SCD and malaria diagnosis and prognosis. Studies indicate that miRNAs, specifically miR-451a and let-7i-5p, are differentially expressed in HbSS and HbAS compared to controls. Our research examined the levels of exosomal miR-451a and let-7i-5p in red blood cells (RBCs) and infected red blood cells (iRBCs) from multiple sickle Hb genotypes and their impact on parasite growth. We assessed exosomal miR-451a and let-7i-5p levels in vitro in RBC and iRBC supernatants. Exosomal miRNAs exhibited distinct expression patterns in iRBCs from individuals with different sickle Hb genotypes. Additionally, we discovered a correlation between let-7i-5p levels and trophozoite count. Exosomal miR-451a and let-7i-5p could modulate SCD and malaria severity and serve as potential biomarkers for malaria vaccines and therapies.",
