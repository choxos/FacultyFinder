  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric tonsillectomies are increasingly being performed as an outpatient procedure thereby increasing the parental role in post-operative pain management. However, it is unclear if parents receive adequate teaching regarding pain management. We introduced a video teaching tool and compared its efficacy alone and in combination with the standard verbal instruction. METHODS: A prospective study which randomized parents or caregivers of children undergoing tonsillectomy ± adenoidectomy into three groups: 1) standard verbal post-operative instructions; 2) watching the video teaching tool along with standard verbal instructions or 3) video teaching tool only. Parents completed pre and post-instruction assessments of their knowledge of post-operative pain management with responses scored from 0 to 8. Telephone assessments were conducted within 48 post-operative hours with a subjective rating of the helpfulness of the video teaching tool. RESULTS: The study cohort included 99 patients and their families. The median pre-instruction score was 5 of 8 points (Interquartile range [IQR]: 4, 6) and this remained at 5 following instruction. (IQR:4, 6; p = 0.702 difference from baseline). Baseline scores did not vary across the groups (p = 0.156) and there was no increase in the knowledge score from pre to post-test across the three groups. Groups B and C rated the helpfulness of the video teaching tool with a median score of 4 of 5. (IQR: 4, 5). CONCLUSIONS: A baseline deficit exists in parental understanding of post-operative pain management that did not statistically improve regardless of the form post-operative instruction used (verbal vs. video-based instruction). However, the high helpfulness scores in both video groups support the use of video instruction as an alternative to or to complement to verbal instruction. However, further identification of knowledge deficits is required for optimization of post-operative educational materials.",
