  "title": "Measuring patient-reported outcomes in facial aesthetic patients: development of the FACE-Q.",
  "abstract": "To support the development of new techniques and technology in facial aesthetics, sophisticated ways of measuring outcomes are needed. The objective of this study was to develop the content of a set of patient-reported outcome (PRO) scales for use with facial aesthetic patients. A literature review, patient interviews, and input from experts working with facial aesthetic patients were used to develop a conceptual framework for the outcomes deemed important to facial aesthetic patients and to construct items and a set of preliminary PRO scales. The conceptual framework includes the following themes: satisfaction with facial appearance; health-related quality of life; recovery, early life impact, and adverse effects; and satisfaction with process of care. Separate scales were developed for all parts of the face (e.g., nose, ears, forehead, cheeks, etc.) rather than for particular facial procedures. This new PRO instrument, called the FACE-Q, contains multiple independently scoreable scales with preoperative and postoperative versions. Once psychometric evaluation is completed, the FACE-Q will provide researchers and physicians with the necessary tools to measure the impact and effectiveness of facial aesthetic procedures from the patients' perspective. The FACE-Q has the potential to support advocacy, quality metrics, and an evidence-based approach to facial aesthetic practice.",
