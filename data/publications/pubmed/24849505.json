  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of our institutional beta-blocker protocol for treatment of complicated infantile hemangiomas (IH). STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective descriptive study of 76 infants/children with IH treated with oral propranolol at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between June 2008 and August 2010 was performed, assessing both the safety and efficacy of propranolol. Based on preliminary data showing hemangioma recrudescence off-treatment, we reviewed 9 additional patients with recrudescence between August 2010 and December 2011. RESULTS: Mild adverse events included asymptomatic bradycardia, gastrointestinal symptoms, asymptomatic hypotension, cool hands/feet, asymptomatic hypoglycemia, and sleep disturbance. Sixteen patients had recrudescence of IH off-treatment, with propranolol discontinued at a median age of 14 months (interquartile range 10-15 months). CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol appears to be associated with minor, not severe symptomatic adverse events. Propranolol appears to be effective in treating complicated IH. Recrudescence can occur off-treatment, even with discontinuing propranolol as late as 15 months of age.",
