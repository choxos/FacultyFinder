  "title": "Phosphorus High-rate application through band placement improved cotton productivity under arid climate.",
  "abstract": "The plant-available soil phosphorus rate and methods for applying phosphatic fertilizer and soil P-fixation capacity are critical factors for lower cotton productivity in Southern Punjab, Pakistan. Hence, a two-year study was conducted in Central Cotton Research Institute (CCRI), Multan, Pakistan, to examine the effects of various P rates and application methods on cotton crop output during the growing seasons of 2014 and 2015. Phosphorus was applied in four rates (0, 40, 80, and 120 kg ha[-1] P2O5) using broadcast, band application, and fertigation methods. Results indicated that the impact of P rates was statistically significant on plant height, the number of nodes, monopodial and sympodial branches, leaf area index, harvest index, and seed cotton yield. The greater P application (120 kg P2O5 ha[-1]) had a better effect on cotton productivity than the lower application rates (0, 40, and 80 kg P2O5 ha[-1]). The band application responded better on nodes plant[-1], sympodial branches plant[-1], boll weight, leaf area index, lint yield, and harvest during the growing season 2015. Therefore, by adopting the band application coupled with 120 kg P2O5 ha[-1] rather than the conventional method of broadcast, productivity of cotton crops could be increased.",
