  "title": "Prevalence of Low-Value Care and Its Associations with Patient-Centered Outcomes in Dementia.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Low-value care (LvC) is defined as care unlikely to provide a benefit to the patient regarding the patient's preferences, potential harms, costs, or available alternatives. Avoiding LvC and promoting recommended evidence-based treatments, referred to as high-value care (HvC), could improve patient-reported outcomes for people living with dementia (PwD). OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the prevalence of LvC and HvC in dementia and the associations of LvC and HvC with patients' quality of life and hospitalization. METHODS: The analysis was based on data of the DelpHi trial and included 516 PwD. Dementia-specific guidelines, the \"Choosing Wisely\" campaign and the PRISCUS list were used to indicate LvC and HvC treatments, resulting in 347 LvC and HvC related recommendations. Of these, 77 recommendations (51 for LvC, 26 for HvC) were measured within the DelpHi-trial and finally used for this analysis. The association of LvC and HvC treatments with PwD health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and hospitalization was assessed using multiple regression models. RESULTS: LvC was highly prevalent in PwD (31%). PwD receiving LvC had a significantly lower quality of life (b = -0.07; 95% CI -0.14 - -0.01) and were significantly more likely to be hospitalized (OR = 2.06; 95% CI 1.26-3.39). Different HvC treatments were associated with both positive and negative changes in HRQoL. CONCLUSION: LvC could cause adverse outcomes and should be identified as early as possible and tried to be replaced. Future research should examine innovative models of care or treatment pathways supporting the identification and replacement of LvC in dementia.",
