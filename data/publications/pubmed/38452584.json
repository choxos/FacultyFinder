  "title": "Exploring ncRNA-mediated pathways in sepsis-induced pyroptosis.",
  "abstract": "Sepsis, a potentially fatal illness caused by an improper host response to infection, remains a serious problem in the world of healthcare. In recent years, the role of ncRNA has emerged as a pivotal aspect in the intricate landscape of cellular regulation. The exploration of ncRNA-mediated regulatory networks reveals their profound influence on key molecular pathways orchestrating pyroptotic responses during septic conditions. Through a comprehensive analysis of current literature, we navigate the diverse classes of ncRNAs, including miRNAs, lncRNAs, and circRNAs, elucidating their roles as both facilitators and inhibitors in the modulation of pyroptotic processes. Furthermore, we highlight the potential diagnostic and therapeutic implications of targeting these ncRNAs in the context of sepsis, aiming to cover the method for novel and effective strategies to mitigate the devastating consequences of septic pathogenesis. As we unravel the complexities of this regulatory axis, a deeper understanding of the intricate crosstalk between ncRNAs and pyroptosis emerges, offering promising avenues for advancing our approach to sepsis intervention. The intricate pathophysiology of sepsis is examined in this review, which explores the dynamic interaction between ncRNAs and pyroptosis, a highly regulated kind of programmed cell death.",
