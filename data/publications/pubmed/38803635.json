  "title": "Non-coronary peripheral arterial complications in people with type 2 diabetes: a Swedish retrospective cohort study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Few studies have explored long-term trends and risk factors for peripheral arterial complications in type 2 diabetes compared to the general population. Our research focuses on identifying optimal risk factors, their significance, risk associated with multifactorial risk factor control, and trends for these complications in diabetic patients versus general controls. METHODS: This study included persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus entered into the Swedish National Diabetes Register 2001-2019 and controls matched for age-, sex- and county of residence. Outcomes comprised of extracranial large artery disease, aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, lower extremity arterial disease and diabetes foot disease. Standardized incidence rates and Cox regression were used for analyses. FINDINGS: The study comprises 655,250 persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus; average age 64.2; 43.8% women. Among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the incidence rates per 100,000 person years for each non-coronary peripheral arterial complication event changed between 2001 and 2019 as follows: extracranial large artery disease 170.0-84.9; aortic aneurysm 40.6-69.2; aortic dissection 9.3 to 5.6; lower extremity artery disease from 338.8 to 190.8; and diabetic foot disease from 309.8 to 226.8. Baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), smoking status and lipid levels were independently associated with all outcomes in the type 2 diabetes mellitus cohort. Within the cohort with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the risk for extracranial large artery disease and lower extremity artery disease increased in a stepwise fashion for each risk factor not within target. Excess risk for non-coronary peripheral arterial complications in the entire cohort for persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, compared to matched controls, were as follows: extracranial large artery disease adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.69 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.65-1.73), aortic aneurysm HR 0.89 (95% CI, 0.87-0.92), aortic dissection HR 0.51 (95% CI, 0.46-0.57) and lower extremity artery disease HR 2.59 (95% CI, 2.55-2.64). INTERPRETATION: The incidence of non-coronary peripheral arterial complications has declined significantly among persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus, with the exception of aortic aneurysm. HbA1c, smoking and blood pressure demonstrated greatest relative contribution for outcomes and lower levels of cardiometabolic risk factors are associated with reduced relative risk of outcomes.
