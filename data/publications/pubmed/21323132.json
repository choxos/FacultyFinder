  "title": "Diagnostic utility of the PTSD Checklist in detecting ptsd in Chinese earthquake victims.",
  "abstract": "By using the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) as the gold standard to identify PTSD, the current study investigated the diagnostic efficiency of the PTSD Checklist (PCL) as a screening questionnaire in a sample of 152 Chinese victims of the Wenchuan earthquake. The results showed that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was .96 (SE = .02), and the optimally efficient cutoff score was 44. The findings provide preliminary support of the PCL as a screening questionnaire among Chinese earthquake victims. The present study may contribute to further PTSD-related research and practices in Chinese disaster settings.",
