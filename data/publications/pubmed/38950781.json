  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Females with von Willebrand disease (VWD) do not show the same increases in von Willebrand factor and factor (F)VIII levels during pregnancy as females without VWD and are at higher risk of excessive bleeding associated with childbirth. Data on hemostatic management for childbirth in VWD patients are limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the dosing, efficacy, and safety of plasma-derived von Willebrand factor/FVIII (wilate) for prevention of excessive bleeding associated with childbirth in females with any type of VWD. METHODS: Data for females with VWD who received wilate for hemostatic coverage for childbirth during 2 prospective clinical studies were analyzed. RESULTS: Ten females with VWD and a mean age at enrolment of 29.6 years were treated with wilate to prevent excessive bleeding associated with childbirth. Two patients had type 1, 4 had type 2 (2 2A, 1 2B, and 1 2M), and 4 had type 3 VWD. Of the 10 deliveries, 5 were by cesarean section. Patients received a mean of 9.5 infusions of wilate over 6.8 exposure days, with a mean total dose of 234 IU/kg per delivery and 25 IU/kg per infusion. Hemostatic management for all deliveries was rated excellent or good, with no excessive bleeding during delivery and no postpartum bleeding during the period of wilate treatment in any patient. Two patients experienced 8 possible or probable treatment-related adverse events; all were mild or moderate and resolved. No thromboembolic events were observed. CONCLUSION: The results of this case series indicate that wilate provided effective hemostatic cover for childbirth in females with VWD during delivery and postpartum.",
