  "title": "Development of the Get Active Questionnaire for Pregnancy: breaking down barriers to prenatal exercise.",
  "abstract": "Evidence-based guidelines represent the highest level of scientific evidence to identify best practices for clinical/public health. However, the availability of guidelines do not guarantee their use, targeted knowledge translation strategies and tools are necessary to help promote uptake. Following publication of the 2019 Canadian Guideline for Physical Activity throughout Pregnancy, the Get Active Questionnaire for Pregnancy, and an associated Health Care Provider Consultation Form for Prenatal Physical Activity were developed to promote guideline adoption and use amongst pregnant individuals and health care providers. This paper describes the process of developing these tools. First, a survey was administered to qualified exercise professionals to identify the barriers and facilitators in using existing prenatal exercise screening tools. A Working Group of researchers and stakeholders then convened to develop an evidence-informed exercise pre-participation screening tool for pregnant individuals, building from previous tool and survey findings. Finally, end-user feedback was solicited through a survey and key informant interviews to ensure tools are feasible and acceptable to use in practice. The uptake and use of these documents by pregnant individuals, exercise, and health care professionals will be assessed in future studies. Novelty: Evidence supports the safety/benefits of exercise for most pregnant individuals; however, exercise is not recommended for a small number of individuals with specific medical conditions. The Get Active Questionnaire for Pregnancy and Health Care Provider Consultation Form for Physical Activity during Pregnancy identify individuals where prenatal exercise may pose a risk, while reducing barriers to physical activity participation for the majority of pregnant individuals.",
