  "title": "Yield Response to Orange Cane Blotch of Blackberry Grown in the Georgia Coastal Plain.",
  "abstract": "Orange cane blotch (OCB), an algal disease on commercial blackberry plants in the southeastern United States, has been an increasing concern among producers. The causal agent, Cephaleuros virescens, produces brightly colored green to orange lesions on blackberry stems, but proof of actual damage and impact on crop yield has not been documented. Naturally infected stem sections were viewed using transmission and scanning electron microscopy to evaluate cane damage. Surface abrasions, intercellular growth, and occasional intracellular growth were observed on the surface and epidermal layers. Field studies at four commercial sites over 2 years were conducted to assess the impact of OCB on yield in 'Ouachita' blackberry plants not treated with algicidal chemicals. Neither cane diameter nor berry size was impacted by severity of OCB; however, berry number decreased with increasing OCB intensity in a nonlinear manner, thereby resulting in reduced yields.",
