  "title": "Influence of tea consumption on acute myocardial infarction in China population: the INTERHEART China study.",
  "abstract": "We assessed the association between tea consumption and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using INTERHEART China data. Cases (n = 2909) and controls (n = 2947) were randomly selected and frequency matched by age and sex. Participants who drank tea ≥4 cups/d had a significantly higher risk of AMI than tea nondrinkers; odds ratio (OR) was 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.03-1.61) compared with tea nondrinkers. A similar trend was found in green tea drinkers; OR was 1.52 (95% CI: 1.13-2.05) in the participants who drank 3 cups/d and 1.73 (95% CI: 1.35-2.22) in the participants who drank ≥4 cups/d compared with tea nondrinkers. We also found that green tea consumption had a greater effect on females; OR was 2.80 (95% CI: 1.43-5.50) in females. In conclusion, we found that the risk of AMI increases as tea consumption increases. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.",
