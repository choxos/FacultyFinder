  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of albumin and C3 complement as serum marker for the early diagnosis of endometriosis in women of reproductive age. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparative study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: Biochemistry Department, Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, in collaboration with the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department, Pakistan Railways Hospital, Rawalpindi, from March 2017 to February 2018. METHODOLOGY: Forty-four patients with endometriosis and 44 controls of reproductive age group were enrolled for the study. Those having other comorbid systemic or endocrine diseases were excluded from the study. Levels of albumin and C3 complement were measured by using Micro Lab 300 and ELISA, respectively; and the results were compared by using SPSS version 21. groups, respectively (p=0.201). The mean serum C3 levels were 1120.9±265 μg/ml and 2241.0±293 μg/ml in the control and endometriosis patient groups, respectively (p <0.001). RESULTS: The mean serum albumin levels were 4.62±0.88 g/dl and 4.42±0.52 g/dl in the control and endometriosis Conclusion: Serum C3 complement were significantly increased in endometriosis patients but not in controls; whereas, serum albumin levels were not significantly different in endometriosis cases as compared to the controls.",
