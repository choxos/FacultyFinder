  "abstract": "We are proposing a shift in mindset in the field of endometriosis, whereby care for patients with endometriosis mirrors that of patients with gynaecological cancer. To achieve this, we advocate for the recognition of complex benign gynaecology as a subspecialty. Since the establishment of gynaecological oncology as a subspecialty, outcomes for patients with ovarian cancer have improved, with their care managed by multidisciplinary teams in specialized units. Despite the marked difference in the primary treatment goal between these two conditions, they share common diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We believe that care management by a multidisciplinary team of dedicated and specialized health care professionals will lead to improved outcomes, including improved quality of life, for people living with endometriosis.",
