  "title": "Effectiveness of Workplace Interventions to Reduce the Risk for Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Workplace type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention programs vary in intervention, delivery and methodologic approaches. Using predetermined criteria, we evaluated the effect and implementation of workplace interventions to prevent T2D. METHODS: We searched Embase, MEDLINE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases from January 2000 to June 2020 to overlap with the launch of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) in 2002. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data from eligible controlled trials. RESULTS: Five trials met the inclusion criteria, which included 1,494 adult participants; 791 (53%) were randomized to workplace interventions and 703 to usual workplace approaches. Pooled analysis showed that, when compared with controls, the participants in DPP-based interventions were 3.85 more likely to show a weight loss of ≥5% (4 randomized controlled trials [RCTs]; risk ratio [RR]=3.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.58 to 9.38; p<0.05), and 9.36-fold more likely to show a weight loss of 7% (2 RCTs; RR=9.36; 95% CI, 2.31 to 37.97; p<0.05). The pooled evidence showed significant difference in effect favouring DPP-based interventions as compared with controls (4 RCTs; standardized mean difference, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.55; p<0.05). All included studies did have 3 common elements of the DPP: coaches, a focus on 7% weight loss and an increase in physical activity to a minimum of 150 min/week. CONCLUSIONS: DPP interventions in the workplace continue to be an important and worthwhile strategy. Our review shows that such programs reveal promising evidence for weight loss and improved physical activities with less intensive and structured supports.",
