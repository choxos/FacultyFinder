  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although impaired diastolic function is common in aortic stenosis (AS), little is known about the clinical usefulness of tissue Doppler imaging (TDI) to detect diastolic dysfunction in patients with mild to moderate AS. The objective was to describe both conventional and TDI measurements of diastolic function in asymptomatic patients enrolled in the Aortic Stenosis Progression Observation Measuring Effects of Rosuvastatin study, a multicenter study to assess the effect of rosuvastatin on the progression of AS. METHODS: Baseline echocardiography measurements, including left ventricular interventricular septal thickness, posterior wall thickness, cavity dimensions, and ejection fraction were obtained. Conventional Doppler indices, including peak early (E) and late (A) transmitral velocities, E/A ratio, and E-wave deceleration time, were measured from spectral Doppler. Tissue Doppler measurements, including early (E') and late (A') velocities of the lateral annulus, were determined, and E/E' was calculated. RESULTS: The study population included 172 patients (aged 57 +/- 13 years; 73 were female) divided into three categories of AS severity on the basis of peak velocity at baseline (group I: 2.5-3.0 m/s; group II: 3.1-3.5 m/s; group III; 3.6-4.0 m/s). Baseline hemodynamics, left ventricular dimensions, and conventional diastolic functional parameters were similar among all 3 groups. In patients with greater severity of AS, the lateral E' was lower and the E/E' (as an estimate of increased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) was higher (P <.05). CONCLUSION: In patients with mild to moderate asymptomatic AS, TDI measures of diastolic function are abnormal and related to the severity of AS. These findings may help to predict the future development of symptoms in this population.",
