  "title": "Nanosilica and salicylic acid synergistically regulate cadmium toxicity in rice.",
  "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) toxicity negatively impacts plant health and productivity. Nanosilica (SiO2NPs) and salicylic acid (SA) enhance plant performance and alleviate heavy metals stress. Yet, their combined effects against Cd-toxicity in rice remained less-explored. Thus, a hydroponic study investigated the individual and combined effects of SiO2NPs and SA on Cd-stress mitigation in rice at physio-biochemical, cellular, and molecular levels. Results indicated that Cd-alone treatment caused a significant reduction in rice growth and biomass and photosynthetic efficiency, which was associated with oxidative damage caused by enhanced Cd-accumulation in plant tissues. Cd-induction also potentiated its phytotoxicity by triggering enzymatic antioxidants against the extra production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The addition of SiO2NPs and/or SA markedly minimized the Cd-induced toxicity by reducing Cd-bioaccumulation (42-56%), protecting photosynthetic efficiency, which were directly correlated with seedling biomass and restored cellular structures (leaf ultrastructure and surface morphology). The combined application of SiO2NPs and SA was more effective in activating antioxidant enzymes, phytohormones biosynthesis, and reducing oxidative damages caused by Cd than sole application. This was evident in the decreased production of ROS, malondialdehyde contents (29-37%), and recovered membrane stability. Moreover, SiO2NPs and/or SA relieved Cd-bioaccumulation (41-56%) by downregulating the Cd-related transporter genes (OsNramp1, OsNramp5, OsHMA2, and OsHMA3). Altogether, the cellular Cd-accumulation, photosynthesis, antioxidant defense, and phytohormones against oxidative stress can be ideal markers for cultivating rice in Cd-contaminated soils.",
