  "title": "An in vitro intestinal model captures immunomodulatory properties of the microbiota in inflammation.",
  "abstract": "Considerable effort has been put forth to understand mechanisms by which the microbiota modulates and responds to inflammation. Here, we explored whether oxidation metabolites produced by the host during inflammation, sodium nitrate and trimethylamine oxide, impact the composition of a human stool bacterial population in a gut simulator. We then assessed whether an immune-competent in vitro intestinal model responded differently to spent medium from bacteria exposed to these cues compared to spent medium from a control bacterial population. The host-derived oxidation products were found to decrease levels of Bacteroidaceae and overall microbiota metabolic potential, while increasing levels of proinflammatory Enterobacteriaceae and lipopolysaccharide in bacterial cultures, reflecting shifts that occur in vivo in inflammation. Spent microbiota media induced elevated intracellular mucin levels and reduced intestinal monolayer integrity as reflected in transepithelial electrical resistance relative to fresh medium controls. However, multiplexed cytokine analysis revealed markedly different cytokine signatures from intestinal cultures exposed to spent medium with added oxidation products relative to spent control medium, while cytokine signatures of cultures exposed to fresh media were similar regardless of addition of host-derived cues. Further, the presence of immune cells in the intestinal model was required for this differentiation of cytokine signatures. This study indicates that simple in vitro immune-competent intestinal models can capture bacterial-mammalian cross-talk in response to host-derived oxidation products and supports utility of these systems for mechanistic studies of interactions between the gut microbiome and host in inflammation.",
