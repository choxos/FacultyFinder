  "title": "Deep Characterization of Serum Metabolome Based on the Segment-Optimized Spectral-Stitching Direct-Infusion Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry Approach.",
  "abstract": "Direct-infusion Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (DI-FTICR MS) shows great promise for metabolomic analysis due to ultrahigh mass accuracy and resolution. However, most of the DI-FTICR MS approaches focused on high-throughput metabolomics analysis at the expense of sensitivity and resolution and the potential for metabolome characterization has not been fully explored. Here, we proposed a novel deep characterization approach of serum metabolome using a segment-optimized spectral-stitching DI-FTICR MS method integrated with high-confidence and database-independent formula assignments. With varied acquisition parameters for each segment, a highly efficient acquisition was achieved for the whole mass range with sub-ppm mass accuracy. In a pooled human serum sample, thousands of features were assigned with unambiguous formulas and possible candidates based on highly accurate mass measurements. Furthermore, a reaction network was used to select confidently unique formulas from possible candidates, which was constructed by unambiguous formulas and possible candidates connected by the formula differences resulting from biochemical and MS transformation. Compared with full-range and conventional segment acquisition, 8- and 1.2-fold increases in observed features were achieved, respectively. Assignment accuracy was 93-94% for both a standard mixture containing 190 metabolites and a spiked serum sample with the root mean square mass error of 0.15-0.16 ppm. In total, 3534 unequivocal neutral molecular formulas were assigned in the pooled serum sample, 35% of which are contained in the HMDB. This method offers great enhancement in the deep characterization of serum metabolome by DI-FTICR MS.",
