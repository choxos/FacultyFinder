  "title": "D609 inhibition of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C attenuates prolonged insulin stimulation-mediated GLUT4 downregulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.",
  "abstract": "Glucose uptake is stimulated by insulin via stimulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation to the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments in adipose tissue and muscles. Insulin stimulation for prolonged periods depletes GLUT4 protein, particularly in highly insulin-responsive GLUT4 storage vesicles. This depletion mainly occurs via H2O2-mediated retromer inhibition. However, the post-receptor mechanism of insulin activation of oxidative stress remains unknown. Here, we show that phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) plays an important role in insulin-mediated downregulation of GLUT4. In the study, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were exposed to a PC-PLC inhibitor, tricyclodecan-9-yl-xanthogenate (D609), for 30 min prior to the stimulation with 500 nM insulin for 4 h, weakening the depletion of GLUT4. D609 also prevents insulin-driven H2O2 generation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Exogenous PC-PLC and its product, phosphocholine (PCho), also caused GLUT4 depletion and promoted H2O2 generation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, insulin-mediated the increase in the cellular membrane PC-PLC activity was observed in Amplex Red assays. These results suggested that PC-PLC plays an important role in insulin-mediated downregulation of GLUT4 and that PCho may serve as a signaling molecule.",
