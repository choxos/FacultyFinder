  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Children with neurologic impairment often fail medical management of gastroesophageal reflux and proceed to fundoplication and gastrostomy (FG) or percutaneous gastrojejunostomy (GJ). Current guidelines do not recommend one treatment over the other, and there is ongoing uncertainty regarding clinical management. METHODS: We conducted a structured search of Medline, Embase, trial registries, and the gray literature. We included studies that compared outcomes for FG and GJ in children with neurologic impairment. RESULTS: We identified 556 children from three retrospective studies who underwent FG (n=431) or GJ (n=125). There were no differences in rates of pneumonia (17% vs 19%, p=0.74) or mortality (13% vs 14%, p=0.76). Few deaths were due to procedural complications (1%) or reflux (2%). There was a trend towards more major complications with FG (29%) compared to GJ (12%) (risk ratio=1.70, 0.85-3.41, p=0.14). Minor complications were more common with GJ (70%) than FG (45%), but this difference was also not statistically significant (risk ratio=0.38, 0.05-3.07, p=0.36). No studies reported quality of life using validated measures. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of the evidence for outcomes of FG versus GJ is very low. Large comparative studies are needed to determine which approach is associated with the best quality-of-life outcomes.",
