  "title": "Reciprocal activation of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion molecules in acute coronary syndromes.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The acute coronary syndromes are associated with an intense inflammatory response and sustained leukocyte activation. This inflammatory state has been correlated with an adverse prognosis, but the source of this inflammation remains controversial, with evidence that it may arise either from the coronary vasculature or from the systemic endothelium. METHODS: Levels of soluble cell adhesion molecules, and of their respective monocyte cell surface ligands, were measured in the peripheral serum of 21 patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and expression of the monocyte integrins CD11b (Mac-1) and CD49d (VLA-4) was measured by direct immunofluorescence using flow cytometry. RESULTS: High levels of the monocyte receptor CD11b (531 vs. 345 MFI, P<0.01), and its soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (329 vs. 232 ng/ml, P<0.01), were noted in patients with acute coronary syndromes compared to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Reciprocal activation of monocyte receptor ligands and endothelial adhesion molecules was found in the peripheral blood of patients with acute coronary syndromes. This may indicate a coordinated state of pro-inflammatory upregulation with widespread activation of both leukocytes and endothelium and suggests a systemic rather than local source for inflammation in acute coronary disease.",
