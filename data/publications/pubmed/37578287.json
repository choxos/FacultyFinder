  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To examine the feasibility of a virtual parent-led peer support group (vPLPSG) intervention for parents of children with eating disorders (EDs). METHODS: Forty-four parents were invited to attend 2-h-long vPLPSG sessions every other week for 6 months. A convergent mixed methods design was used to integrate quantitative survey data (collected at three timepoints and analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA) and qualitative interview data (collected at 6 months and analyzed using content analysis) to assess intervention feasibility. Feasibility was comprised of acceptability (e.g., recruitment and retention rates, desire to continue attending the groups) and preliminary effectiveness (e.g., change in parents' self-reported burden). RESULTS: The recruitment rate (67%), retention rate (77%), and attendance rate (60%) demonstrated adequate acceptability. All parents expressed their recommendation of this group to other parents, and most wanted to continue attending vPLPSG sessions. Participants qualitatively reported less isolation and burden as well as improvements in skills and confidence to manage their child's symptoms. These preliminary effectiveness findings were corroborated by quantitative data, with participants reporting a significant decrease in burden [mean difference (MD) = 6.61; p < .004], increase in confidence (MD = 11.17; p < .001), and decrease in unmet needs (MD = 5.03; p < .001) from baseline to 6-months. DISCUSSION: The vPLPSG intervention demonstrated feasibility with respect to acceptability and improvements in preliminary parental outcomes. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention using a larger, more diverse sample. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Dedicated efforts to support caregivers, such as through virtual parent-led peer support groups, have the potential to increase confidence and decrease burden for parents managing their child's eating disorder.",
