  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To support primary care physicians (PCPs) and their patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA), we created a series of evidence-based whiteboard educational videos for patients with knee OA. In a previous study we piloted these videos with patients to understand their acceptability and impact. The purpose of this study was to explore PCPs' perspectives to understand the utility of novel patient education videos to support management. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews of newly practicing and resident PCPs after watching a series of patient education videos. A thematic analysis approach was used combining both inductive and research question driven coding, category formation, and theme identification. RESULTS: Ten participants were included. Barriers to optimal management were identified including the challenge of patient adherence and access to non-operative treatments. PCPs indicated that the videos would support their management of patients with knee OA by (1) supporting credibility and building trust with their patient, (2) reinforcing patient understanding, and (3) enhancing their own management of patients. CONCLUSION: Future implementation of these resources with attention to barriers that may limit uptake is necessary and may optimize management of knee OA in primary care.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONThe provision of patient educational materials may support patient buy-in regarding appropriate management, enhance patient understanding, and improve physicians' future practice.Viewing these videos could potentially improve physicians' future resource use, recommendation of non-operative treatments, and the quality of their total knee replacement referrals, which has benefits to both the patient and the healthcare system.Perceived barriers to implementing evidence-based recommendations may pose a challenge for patients and clinicians and should be considered to help facilitate the uptake of educational interventions.",
