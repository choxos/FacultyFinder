  "title": "Comparison of two types of intervention to enhance placental redistribution in term infants: randomized control trial.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The objective of the study was to compare the effect of umbilical cord milking (UCM) and delayed cord clamping (DCC) on hematological parameters (serum ferritin and hemoglobin) at 6 weeks of life in term neonates. It was a randomized controlled trail conducted at a teaching hospital in North India during August 2012 to August 2013. Babies born at >36 weeks of gestation were randomized in two groups, UCM and DCC (100 in each group). Umbilical cord milking was done after cutting and clamping the cord at 25 cm from the umbilicus. In DCC group, clamping was delayed by 60 to 90 s before cutting the cord. The baseline characteristics were comparable in the two groups. Mean serum ferritin (134.0 ng/ml [89.8]) and mean hemoglobin (11.0 gm/dl [2.4]) in umbilical cord milking group was comparable to mean serum ferritin (142.7 ng/ml [87.1]) and hemoglobin (11.3 gm/dl [2.6]) in DCC group at 6 weeks of age. There was no difference in hemodynamic status, cranial Doppler indices, and adverse neonatal outcomes among the two groups. CONCLUSION: In term neonates, the DCC and UCM had comparable effect on hematological parameters at 6 weeks of life. WHAT IS KNOWN: • Delayed cord blood clamping improves certain hematologic parameters for neonates, which is potentially important in populations with high rates of neonatal and childhood anemia, but that delayed cord blood clamping may not be feasible in clinical situations when neonatal resuscitation is urgent. WHAT IS NEW: • There is no significant difference in ferritin and hemoglobin levels at 6 weeks among term, Indian neonates who had UCM and DCC and that this study may give support to the practice of UCM in term deliveries when DCC is not feasible.",
