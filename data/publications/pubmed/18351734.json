  "abstract": "This report describes platinum(II) complexes of 6-(2-pyridyl)-dipyrido[3,2- a:2',3'- c]phenazine (dppzp) and 6-phenyl-dipyrido[3,2- a:2',3'- c]phenazine (dppzphi). The [Pt(dppzp)Cl] (+) (1) system exhibits an excited-state lifetime of 5.0 micros in deoxygenated dichloromethane. Lewis bases quench the emission with rate constants on the order of 10 (7) M (-1) s (-1); however, acetic acid is definitely not a quencher. The carbometalated [Pt(dppzphi)Cl] (2) complex is novel in that it is subject to quenching by acid as well. In deoxygenated 2-chloronaphthalene, the excited-state lifetime of 2 is 270 ns, and acetic acid quenches the emission with a rate constant of 2 x 10 (8) M (-1) s (-1). In addition, Lewis bases like dimethyl sulfoxide and dimethylformamide quench the emission of 1 and 2 with similar efficiencies. The coordinatively unsaturated platinum center provides a logical place for attack by Lewis bases, whereas the phenazine extension of dppzphi introduces potentially acid-sensitive nitrogen centers. The emissive states of 1 and 2 exhibit mainly intraligand character, but enhanced charge-transfer character in 2 accounts for the differences in reactivity.",
