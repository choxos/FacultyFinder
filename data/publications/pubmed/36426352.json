  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The emergence of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has significantly improved the clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic melanoma. However, survival benefits are only observed in a subset of patients. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family genes are frequently mutated in melanoma, yet their impacts on the efficacy of ICIs remain unclear. Our study aimed to explore the association of FGFR mutations with ICIs efficacy in metastatic melanoma. METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data (PanCancer Atlas, skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM), n = 448) in cBioPortal were collected as a TCGA cohort to investigate the association between FGFR mutations and prognosis of melanoma patients. To explore the impact of FGFR mutations on the efficacy of ICIs in melanoma, clinical and tumor whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of four ICI-treated studies from cBioPortal were consolidated as an ICIs-treated cohort. Moreover, the relationship between FGFR mutations and immunogenicity (tumor mutation burden (TMB), neo-antigen load (NAL), mismatch repair (MMR)-related genes and DNA damage repair (DDR)-related genes) of melanoma was evaluated utilizing data from the ICIs-treated cohort. The influence of FGFR mutations on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) of melanoma was also analyzed using the TCGA cohort. RESULTS: In the TCGA cohort, survival in melanoma patients with or without FGFR mutations was nearly equivalent. In the ICIs-treated cohort, patients with FGFR mutations had better survival than those without (median overall survival: 60.00 vs. 31.00 months; hazard ratio: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.80; P = 0.0051). Besides, the objective response rate was higher for patients harboring FGFR mutations (55.56%) compared to wild-type patients (22.40%) (P = 0.0076). Mechanistically, it was revealed that FGFR mutations correlated with increased immunogenicity (e.g., TMB, NAL, MMR-related gene mutations and DDR-related gene mutations). Meanwhile, FGFR mutant melanoma tended to exhibit an enhanced antitumor TIME compared with its wild-type counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that FGFR mutations is a promising biomarker in stratifying patients with advanced melanoma who might benefit from ICIs therapy.",
