  "title": "A highly selective and sensitive sensor for promethazine based on molecularly imprinted interface coated Au/Sn bimetal nanoclusters functionalized acupuncture needle microelectrode.",
  "abstract": "Promethazine (PMZ) is an effective antihistamine that is used as a nerve tranquilizer to treat mental disorders. However, drug abuse causes harm to the human body and also pollutes the environment to a certain extent. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a highly selective and sensitive biosensor for PMZ determination. An acupuncture needle (AN) was used as an electrode in 2015, and further research on the electrode's essence in electrochemistry is needed. In this work, a sensor based on a surface imprinted film coordinated Au/Sn biometal was first fabricated on AN via electrochemistry. The obtained cavities showed complementary and suitable sites for \"N atom\" electron transfer through the phenyl ring structure in promethazine, which is rigorous for the configuration near the interface. Under the optimal conditions, MIP/Au/Sn/ANE exhibits a good linear relationship in the range of 0.5 μM-500 μM, and the detection limit (LOD) is 0.14 μM (S/N = 3). The sensor exhibits good repeatability, stability, and selectivity and can be successfully used to analyze and detect PMZ in human serum and environmental water. The findings are scientifically significant for AN electrochemistry and the sensors have potential for in vivo medicamentosus monitoring in the future.",
