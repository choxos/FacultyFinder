  "title": "New Tools to Test Stool: Managing Travelers' Diarrhea in the Era of Molecular Diagnostics.",
  "abstract": "Travelers' diarrhea affects up to 60% of visitors to tropical and subtropical regions. Although symptoms are generally self-limited, some infections are associated with significant morbidity and occasional mortality. Newer molecular diagnostic techniques allow for highly sensitive, specific, and expeditious testing of a wide range of potential pathogens. Identification of the causative pathogen of travelers' diarrhea allows for targeted therapy and management and a reduction in empiric broad-spectrum coverage.",
