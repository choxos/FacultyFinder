  "title": "Impact of Transcatheter Mitral Valve Repair on Preprocedural and Postprocedural Hospitalization Rates.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to determine the effect of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVr) on hospitalization rates by assessing pre- and postprocedural hospitalization patterns. BACKGROUND: TMVr has emerged as the treatment of choice for selected patients with mitral regurgitation, but the impact of these procedures on hospital utilization remains unclear. METHODS: All patients who underwent TMVr in Ontario, Canada, between 2011 and 2017 were included in this observational study using population-based data. Hospitalization person-year rates were assessed in the years before and after TMVr and 4 predefined intervals: 1 to 30, 31 to 90, 91 to 182, and 183 to 365Â days. Main outcomes of interest were all-cause and heart failure (HF) hospitalizations. Poisson regression models were used to compare incidence rates across all time periods. RESULTS: The study cohort included 523 patients. In the year preceding TMVr, 66.2% of patients were hospitalized compared with 47.4% in the year following. There were stepwise increases in both all-cause and HF hospitalization rates in the periods preceding the index procedure, and all postprocedural periods had significantly lower hospitalization rates. The adjusted rate ratios for all-cause and HF-related hospitalization in the year after TMVr were 0.65 (95% CI: 0.56-0.76) and 0.38 (95% CI: 0.29-0.51), respectively. All time periods had significant reductions in all-cause and HF hospitalization in the adjusted analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In this population-based study, significant reductions were observed in both all-cause and HF-related hospitalizations in all time periods after TMVr compared with the year prior. This suggests that TMVr has a sustained effect on hospitalization rates despite a high-risk population.",
