  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a temporary condition of pregnancy, identifies women at high risk of developing subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). Lifestyle interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of developing T2D after GDM. However, they often have low attendance and adherence rates. The Avoiding Diabetes After Pregnancy Trial in Moms (ADAPT-M) program is a 24-week, home-based postpartum program aimed at bridging the gap from prenatal care to T2D prevention for women with GDM. Our objective was to explore the experiences of participants who completed the ADAPT-M program, to elicit their perceived benefits and opportunities for improvement. METHODS: This was a qualitative descriptive study wherein we conducted semistructured interviews with 21 women with previous GDM who participated in the ADAPT-M program in Ontario, Canada. Transcripts were analyzed using NVivo software using a conventional content analysis approach. RESULTS: Two themes describing the experience of women who underwent the ADAPT-M lifestyle-based coaching program emerged: 1) the benefits of a supportive relationship between coaches and participants; and 2) a desire for more from the program, including peer support, more customization, and addressing emotional needs. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the importance of fostering supportive health-care relationships in T2D prevention programs for postpartum women with a history of GDM. Enhanced customization, emotional support, and opportunities for peer support should be considered in the development of future programming to better meet the needs of participants.",
