  "abstract": "Cell surface localized membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP) plays an important role in physiological and pathological processes and its function can be regulated by proteins such as RECK. We examined the ability of miR-182 (one of the miR-183 cluster miRNAs), which can target RECK, to control cell surface MT1-MMP activity. Expression of RECK mRNA and protein was increased with anti-miRs to miR-182, miR-183 or miR-96 in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells, but, decreased RECK mRNA and increased its protein in the benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line BPH-1. Treatment of BPH-1 and HT-1080 cells with the anti-miRs did not change the level of cell surface MT1-MMP activity, nor their rate of migration in an in vitro wound-healing assay. Trichostatin A (TSA) did not increase the level of RECK, but blocked cell surface MT1-MMP activity and decreased cell motility. Anti-miRs mediated increased RECK levels did not interfere with cell surface MT1-MMP function, and TSA may block cell surface localization of MT1-MMP by a mechanism independent of RECK.",
