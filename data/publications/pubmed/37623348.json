  "title": "The Clinical Validation of a Common Analytical Change Criteria for Cardiac Troponin for Ruling in an Acute Cardiovascular Outcome in Patients Presenting with Ischemic Chest Pain Symptoms.",
  "abstract": "Serial cardiac troponin (cTn) testing on patients with symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is primarily to identify those patients with evolving myocardial injury. With the improved analytical performance of the high-sensitivity cTn (hs-cTn) assays, different change criteria have been proposed that are mostly assay dependent. Here, we developed and compared a new Common Change Criteria (3C for the combined criteria of >3 ng/L, >30%, or >15% based on the initial cTn concentration of <10 ng/L, 10 to 100 ng/L, or >100 ng/L, respectively) method, versus the 2 h assay-dependent absolute change criteria endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), versus the common relative >20% change criterion. These different analytical change criteria were evaluated in 855 emergency department (ED) patients with symptoms of ACS and who had two samples collected 3 h apart. The cTn concentrations were measured with four different assays (Abbott hs-cTnI, Roche hs-cTnT, Ortho cTnI-ES, and Ortho hs-cTnI). The outcomes evaluated were myocardial infarction (MI) and a composite outcome (MI, unstable angina, ventricular arrhythmia, heart failure, or cardiovascular death) within 7 days of ED presentation. The combined change criteria (3C) method yielded higher specificities (range: 93.9 to 97.2%) as compared to the >20% criterion (range: 42.3 to 88.1%) for all four assays for MI. The 3C method only yielded a higher specificity estimate for MI for the cTnI-ES assay (95.9%) versus the absolute change criteria (71.7%). Similar estimates were obtained for the composite outcome. There was also substantial agreement between hs-cTnT and the different cTnI assays for MI with the 3C method, with the percent agreement being â‰¥95%. The Common Change Criteria (3C) method combining both absolute and different percent changes may be used with cTnI, hs-cTnT, and different hs-cTnI assays to yield similar high-specificity (rule-in) estimates for adverse cardiovascular events for patients presenting to the ED with ACS symptoms.",
