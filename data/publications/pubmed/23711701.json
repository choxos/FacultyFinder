  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the anxiolytic activity of newly isolated compound by our lab called ursolic acid stearoyl glucoside (UASG) from the leaves of Lantana camara (L. camara). METHODS: Column chromatography was used to isolate UASG. Anxiolytic potential was experimentally proved and demonstrated through Elevated plus-maze, Open field and light and dark test. RESULTS: The UASG showed marked increased in time spent (%) and number of frequent movements made by animals in open arm of elevated plus-maze apparatus. In light and dark model, UASG produced marked increase in time spent by animal, number of crossing and reduced duration of immobility in light box. CONCLUSIONS: UASG showed significant increase in number of rearing, assisted rearing and number of square crossed in open field established test model. UASG showed its anxiolytic effect in dose dependent manner.",
