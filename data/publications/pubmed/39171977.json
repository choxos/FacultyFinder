  "abstract": "We propose a scalable system of compact, superconducting neutron monitors, which can be embedded in any existing cryogenic infrastructure of a fusion system. The pixel-based nature of the detectors allows them to be placed at intervals following the circumference of a cooled zone, e.g., a field coil, thus allowing for a tomographic measurement of the neutron flux surrounding the plasma. An early stage prototype of the superconducting bolometer is described, and the key results of a previous feasibility study of this prototype performed with cold neutrons are summarized. The bolometer can be adapted for use with fast neutrons by altering the composition and geometry of the neutron-to-heat conversion layer. This paper describes the initial feasibility considerations for implementation in a superconducting tokamak. The sensor is based on a high-temperature superconductor, making it possible to select the operation temperature in the range 1-90 K. Neutron flux numbers were found using the ITER MCNP reference model, and these were embedded in a TOPAS model to find the expected signal measured by the bolometer at the position of a toroidal field coil. The results at the coil position indicate suitable operation levels in terms of the magnitude of the measured signal, with a measurable signal of several ohm, which is much smaller than the saturation energy of the detector. Radiation hardness is estimated and found to be on the order of at least 40 years for the relevant radiation levels. The upcoming investigation activities of the project are described for both radiation testing and analytical modeling.",
