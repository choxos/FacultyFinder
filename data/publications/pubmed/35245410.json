  "title": "Proton-Pump Inhibitors and Risk of Calcium Pyrophosphate Deposition in a Population-Based Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: There are no proven effective medical treatments to prevent calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD). Hypomagnesemia is a known CPPD risk factor. The present study was undertaken to carry out a real-world epidemiologic study on proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) use, which can cause hypomagnesemia, and CPPD risk. METHODS: We conducted a time-stratified, propensity score (PS)-matched cohort study using the UK-based IQVIA Medical Research Data. We compared risk of incident CPPD among PPI users versus H2 blocker users using Cox proportional hazards models. We used greedy matching of incident PPI users 1:1 to incident histamine receptor 2 (H2) blocker users in 1-year cohort accrual blocks. Subjects were censored at time of drug switch. We evaluated incident use of PPI and H2 blockers prior to incident CPPD using a nested case-control study within the same cohort, matched 1:4 by age and sex using risk-set sampling. RESULTS: We identified 81,102 PPI and H2 blocker initiators, with 113 and 63 incident cases of CPPD, respectively. In the case-control study when compared with nonusers, both PPI and H2 B users had higher risk of incident CPPD, with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.79 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.55-2.07) and 1.52 (95% CI 1.14-2.03), respectively. Incident PPI use was nonsignificantly associated with incident CPPD (hazard ratio 1.03 [95% CI 0.75-1.41]) compared with H2 blocker use. CONCLUSION: In this study using real-world data, incident use of PPIs was not associated with a higher risk of CPPD compared with incident H2 blocker use, although use of PPI and H2 blockers had higher risk compared with nonuse.",
