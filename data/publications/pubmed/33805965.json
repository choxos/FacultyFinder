  "title": "Population-Level Data on Child Development at School Entry Reflecting Social Determinants of Health: A Narrative Review of Studies Using the Early Development Instrument.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Early Development Instrument (EDI) was developed as a population-level assessment of children's developmental health at school entry. EDI data collection has created unprecedented opportunities for population-level studies on children's developmental outcomes. The goal of this narrative review was to synthesize research using the EDI to describe how it contributes to expanding the understanding of the impacts of social determinants on child development and how it applies to special populations. METHODS: Select studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals between 2015 and 2020 and incorporating the social determinants of health perspectives were chosen to highlight the capability of the EDI to monitor children's developmental health and contribute knowledge in the area of early childhood development. RESULTS: A number of studies have examined the association between several social determinants of health and children's developmental outcomes, including hard-to-reach and low-frequency populations of children. The EDI has also been used to evaluate programs and interventions in different countries. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of the EDI to monitor children's developmental outcomes in various populations has been consistently demonstrated. The EDI, by virtue of its comprehensive breadth and census-like collection, widens the scope of research relating to early childhood development and its social determinants of health.",
