  "abstract": "Pretransplant (Tx) inflammation is linked to adverse outcomes in adult Tx recipients but no such data exist for children. Our study evaluated the predictive value of three pre-Tx inflammatory markers: serum C-reactive protein (CRP), Neopterin (Neo) and interleukin (IL) 12, in determining outcome. Pre-Tx serum on 51 children (mean age 11 years) transplanted between 1985 and 2000 was analyzed. Data on other variables were abstracted from patient records. Primary end-points were graft survival and acute rejection (AR). Kaplan-Meier and log-rank statistics compared endpoints in patients at different quartiles for each marker. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the independent effect of the markers on the end-points. The mean CRP, Neo, and IL-12 were 1.3 mg/l, 1.78 ng/ml, and 123 pg/ml, respectively. The mean CRP, Neo, and IL-12 were not different between the patients with and without AR or graft loss (P > 0.4 for all). Neither rejection-free survival nor graft survival was affected by CRP, Neo, or IL-12 quartiles. Cox-regression analysis demonstrated no predictive value of any marker on outcome. Unlike adults, a single pre-Tx determination of inflammatory markers was not predictive of AR or graft loss in children, indicating that the pathogenesis of AR may be different in children.",
