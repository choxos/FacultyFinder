  "abstract": "Clinical research organizations (CROs) can provide consulting services and support to assist with the conduct of clinical trials from site initiation to study close-out. As the number of CROs continues to increase, it can be difficult to determine the optimal organization to help manage a large or even a small-scale project. We present uses for and attributes to consider when choosing a CRO, and provide examples of four CROs specializing in various therapeutic areas.",
