  "title": "Human milk oligosaccharides are associated with maternal genetics and respiratory health of human milk-fed children.",
  "abstract": "Breastfeeding provides many health benefits, but its impact on respiratory health remains unclear. This study addresses the complex and dynamic nature of the mother-milk-infant triad by investigating maternal genomic factors regulating human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), and their associations with respiratory health among human milk-fed infants. Nineteen HMOs are quantified from 980 mothers of the CHILD Cohort Study. Genome-wide association studies identify HMO-associated loci on chromosome 19p13.3 and 19q13.33 (lowest P = 2.4e-118), spanning several fucosyltransferase (FUT) genes. We identify novel associations on chromosome 3q27.3 for 6'-sialyllactose (P = 2.2e-9) in the sialyltransferase (ST6GAL1) gene. These, plus additional associations on chromosomes 7q21.32, 7q31.32 and 13q33.3, are replicated in the independent INSPIRE Cohort. Moreover, gene-environment interaction analyses suggest that fucosylated HMOs may modulate overall risk of recurrent wheeze among preschoolers with variable genetic risk scores (P < 0.01). Thus, we report novel genetic factors associated with HMOs, some of which may protect the respiratory health of children.",
