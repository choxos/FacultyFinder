  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of single nucleotide polymorphism in three CC, TT and TC genotypes of transforming growth factor β1 T29C in breast cancer patients. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted from April 2017 to April 2018 at the Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in collaboration with Nuclear Oncology Medicine and Radiotherapy Institute and Holy Family Hospital, Rawalpindi. Using convenience sampling, breast cancer cases and healthy controls were enrolled. All investigations were done using standardized laboratory protocols. The outcomes were determined in terms of association of single nucleotide polymorphism of transforming growth factor β1with breast cancer. Data was analysed using SPSS 21. RESULTS: Of the 150 subjects, 80(53.3%) were cases and 70(47.7%) were healthy controls. Among the cases, the most frequent genotype was CC 38(47.5%) followed by TC 26(32.5%) and TT 16(20%). Among the controls, the corrsesponding values were 50(71.42%), 13(18.5%) and 7(10%). Transforming growth factor β1 TC genotype was strongly associated with the increased risk of developing breast cancer (odds ratio: 3.79). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of breast cancer was markedly lower among women with CC genotype compared to those with CT or TT genotypes.",
