  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Effort thrombosis refers to axillosubclavian vein thrombosis secondary to physical activities of the upper extremity. METHODS: This report describes the clinical presentation of effort thrombosis in a millwright and reviews the literature for occupational reports of this condition. RESULTS: While there is a paucity of literature reporting an occupational association, work related physical demands on the upper extremity appears to increase the risk of axillosubclavian impingement and thrombosis in certain patients. CONCLUSION: Effort thrombosis is a rare vascular condition of the upper extremity that may be seen in workers with repetitive, forceful, or overhead arm activities.",
