  "title": "Candidate recommendations for protein electrophoresis reporting from the Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists Monoclonal Gammopathy Working Group.",
  "abstract": "Protein electrophoresis is commonly used as an aid in the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies and is performed in many laboratories in Canada and throughout the world. However, unlike many other diagnostic tests, there is limited guidance for standardization and neither guidance nor specific recommendations for clinical reporting of serum (SPE) or urine (UPE) protein electrophoresis and immunotyping available in the literature. Therefore, a Canadian effort was undertaken to recommend standards that cover all aspects of clinical reporting with an ultimate goal towards reporting standardization. The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists (CSCC) Monoclonal Gammopathy Interest Group (MGIG), which is composed of CSCC members with an interest in protein electrophoresis, has formed a Monoclonal Gammopathy Working Group (MGWG) to take initial steps towards standardization of SPE, UPE and immunotyping. Candidate standardization recommendations were developed, discussed and voted upon by the MGWG. Candidate recommendations that achieved 90% agreement are presented as consensus recommendations. Recommendations that did not achieve 90% consensus remain candidate recommendations and are presented with accompanying MGWG discussion. Eleven consensus recommendations along with candidate recommendations for nomenclature, protein fraction reporting, test utilization, interference handling and interpretive reporting options are presented.",
