  "title": "Assessment of morphological and molecular variability of some Solanum melongena L. cultivars and wild Solanum incanum L. in Saudi Arabia.",
  "abstract": "The genus Solanum exhibits a wide range of variability in morphology, flavor, and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. Phenotypic and genetic variability using ISSR and RAPD markers of Solanum incanum distributed in Al-Baha province of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is assessed. Thirty samples are representing three different locations: Baljershy, Aqeeq, and Tohama, besides twenty-five samples representing five different commercial cultivars tested. Growth type, the number of leaves per plant, fruit size (phenotypic traits), crude protein, carbohydrates, digestive organic matter, and Mg, Ca, P were the principal contributors in the PCA. Molecular analysis showed that 114 ISSR and 80 RAPD alleles with a 100% polymorphism were recorded. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values ranged from 0.84 to 0.91 for ISSR and from 0.59 to 0.89 for RAPD data. Similarity values ranged from 0.16 to 1.00, with an average of 0.47 for ISSR and from 0.01 to 0.97, with an average of 0.36 for RAPD. It resulted in a positive and significant correlation between morphological, molecular, nutritional, and chemical analysis of fruits using Mantel analysis. UPGMA and PCA for morphological traits and molecular data discriminated commercial cultivars and wild relatives. Solanum incanum was more diverse than commercial varieties. This study revealed a wide genetic diversity among and within collected eggplant accessions and may use in breeding programs of eggplants. There is a need to increase the present eggplant collection to widen the genetic diversity of cultivated eggplant varieties in Saudi Arabia.",
