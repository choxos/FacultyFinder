  "abstract": "Microcontact printing (µCP) is a commonly used technique for patterning proteins of interest on substrates. The cells take the shape of these printed patterns. This technique is used to explore the effect of cellular morphology on their various functions such as survival, differentiation, migration, etc. An essential step for µCP is to fabricate a stamp from a silicon mould, prepared using lithography. Lithography is cost intensive and needs a high level of expertise to handle the instrumentation. Also, one stamp can be used to print patterns of one size and shape. Here, to overcome these limitations, we devised a low-cost fabrication technique using readily available objects such as injection needles and polystyrene beads. We patterned the C2C12, myoblasts cells on the shapes printed using lithography-free fabricated stamps. We further exploited the surface curvature of the stamp to vary the size of the print either by changing the applied load and/or the substrate stiffness. We showed that the print dimension could be predicted well by using JKR theory of contact mechanics. Moreover, some innovative improvisations enabled us to print complex shapes, which would be otherwise difficult with conventional lithography technique. We envisage that this low cost and easy to fabricate method will allow many research laboratories with limited resources to perform exciting research which is at present out of their reach.",
