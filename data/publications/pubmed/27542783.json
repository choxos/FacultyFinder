  "abstract": "AIMS: Our aim was to compare stenosis severity and plaque content between STEMI culprit lesions with intact fibrous cap (IFC) and those with plaque rupture (PR) in a prospective study. METHODS AND RESULTS: We evaluated 93 patients undergoing OCT and thrombectomy as part of a prospective substudy of the TOTAL (ThrOmbecTomy versus PCI ALone) trial. Culprit lesion morphology was assessable by OCT in 70/93 (75.3%). IFC was found in 31 (44.3%), PR in 34 (48.6%) and calcified nodule in five (7.1%) patients. Following thrombectomy, OCT demonstrated similar lumen area stenosis in IFC (79.3%) and PR (79.6%) (p=0.88). Lumen area stenosis <50% was observed in none of the patients with PR and in one patient with IFC. IFC had fewer quadrants with lipid plaque as compared to PR (28.16±15.02 vs. 39.12±14.23, p=0.004). However, in both lesion types, lipid was the predominant plaque type (83.9 vs. 63.7% of diseased quadrants). CONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study of STEMI patients treated with thrombectomy, mild residual stenoses were uncommon in IFC lesions. Although lipid content was lower than in PR lesions, lipid composed the majority of the diseased segments in IFC.",
