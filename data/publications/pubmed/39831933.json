  "title": "Targeting senescence and GATA4 in age-related cardiovascular disease: a comprehensive approach.",
  "abstract": "The growing prevalence of age-related cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) poses significant health challenges, necessitating the formulation of novel treatment approaches. GATA4, a vital transcription factor identified for modulating cardiovascular biology and cellular senescence, is recognized for its critical involvement in CVD pathogenesis. This review collected relevant studies from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct using search terms like 'GATA4,' 'cellular senescence,' 'coronary artery diseases,' 'hypertension,' 'heart failure,' 'arrhythmias,' 'congenital heart diseases,' 'cardiomyopathy,' and 'cardiovascular disease.' Additionally, studies investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying GATA4-mediated regulation of GATA4 and senescence in CVDs were analyzed to provide comprehensive insights into this critical aspect of potential treatment targeting. Dysregulation of GATA4 is involved in a variety of CVDs, as demonstrated by both experimental and clinical research, comprising CAD, hypertension, congenital heart diseases, cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, and cardiac insufficiency. Furthermore, cellular senescence enhances the advancement of age-related CVDs. These observations suggested that therapies targeting GATA4, senescence pathways, or both as necessary may be an effective intervention in CVD progression and prognosis. Addressing age-related CVDs by targeting GATA4 and senescence is a broad mechanism approach. It implies further investigation of the molecular nature of these processes and elaboration of an effective therapeutic strategy. This review highlights the importance of GATA4 and senescence in CVD pathogenesis, emphasizing their potential as therapeutic targets for age-related CVDs.",
