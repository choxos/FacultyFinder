  "title": "An Atrial Fibrillation Transitions of Care Clinic Improves Atrial Fibrillation Quality Metrics.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess whether an atrial fibrillation (AF)-specific clinic is associated with improved adherence to American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) clinical performance and quality measures for adults with AF or atrial flutter. BACKGROUND: There are significant gaps in care of patients with AF, including underprescription of anticoagulation and treatment of AF risk factors. An AF specialized clinic was developed to reduce admissions for AF but may also be associated with improved quality of care. METHODS: This retrospective study compared adherence to ACC/AHA measures for patients who presented to the emergency department for AF between those discharged to a typical outpatient appointment and those discharged to a specialized AF transitions clinic run by an advanced practice provider and supervised by a cardiologist. Screening and treatment for common AF risk factors was also assessed. RESULTS: The study enrolled 78 patients into the control group and 160 patients into the intervention group. Patients referred to the specialized clinic were more likely to have stroke risk assessed and documented (99% vs. 26%; p < 0.01); be prescribed appropriate anticoagulation (97% vs. 88%; p = 0.03); and be screened for comorbidities such as tobacco use (100% vs. 14%; p < 0.01), alcohol use (92% vs. 60%; p < 0.01), and obstructive sleep apnea (90% vs. 13%; p < 0.01) and less likely to be prescribed an inappropriate combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications (1% vs. 9%; p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An AF specialized clinic was associated with improved adherence to ACC/AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adult patients with AF.",
