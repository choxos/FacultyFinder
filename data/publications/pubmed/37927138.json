  "title": "Patient perspectives of recovery from myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome: An interpretive description study.",
  "abstract": "AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), also called chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), is characterised by persistent fatigue, postexertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. It is a complex, long-term, and debilitating illness without widely effective treatments. This study describes the treatment choices and experiences of ME/CFS patients who have experienced variable levels of recovery. METHOD: Interpretive description study consisting of semi-structured qualitative interviews with 33Â people who met the US Centers for Disease Control (2015) diagnostic criteria for ME/CFS and report recovery or symptom improvement. RESULTS: Twenty-six participants endorsed partial recovery, and seven reported full recovery from ME/CFS. Participants reported expending significant time and energy to identify, implement, and adapt therapeutic interventions, often without the guidance of a medical practitioner. They formulated individualised treatment plans reflecting their understanding of their illness and personal resources. Most fully recovered participants attributed their success to mind-body approaches. CONCLUSION: Patients with ME/CFS describe independently constructing and managing treatment plans, due to a lack of health system support. Stigmatised and dismissive responses from clinicians precipitated disengagement from the medical system and prompted use of other forms of treatment.",
