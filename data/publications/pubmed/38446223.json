  "title": "Molecular identification of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus in Hyalomma rufipes and Amblyomma variegatum in the Upper East Region of Ghana.",
  "abstract": "Sampled ticks were screened for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) using an assay that targets the nucleoprotein gene region of the S segment, a conserved region of the CCHFV genome. Minimum infection rates of 0.34% and 0.10% were obtained when testing pools of Hyalomma rufipes and Amblyomma variegatum, respectively. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the S and L segments of the CCHFV isolate clustered with those of similar isolates of genotype III. However, analysis of the M segment showed that reassortment had occurred, causing this segment to cluster with those of isolates of genotype I, providing the first evidence of such an occurrence in Ghana.",
