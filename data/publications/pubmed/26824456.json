  "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIMS: Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common histotype of Thyroid cancer (TC). Here, we detected the differentially expressed lncRNAs in tumor tissues and non-tumor tissues of PTC patients by lncRNA microarrays, and explored the function and molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of PTC using a PTC cell line. METHODS: CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay and EdU assay were used to detect the cell viability. Flow Cytometry was used to detect the cell cycle and apoptosis. Transwell and scratch assay were used to detect the cell motility. RESULTS: CCK-8 assay, colony formation assay and EdU assay revealed that lncRNAs (ENST00000537266 and ENST00000426615) could inhibit cell proliferation. Cell cycle analysis showed that cell proportion was statistically significant increased in G1 phase and decreased in S phase and G2 phase in Si-266 transfected TPC-1 cells. In addition, a noteworthy increase of cell proportion in G1 phase accompanied by a decrease in S phase and unchanged G2 phase in Si-615 transfected TPC-1 cells were also observed. Meanwhile, transwell and scratch assay showed that ENST00000426615 could inhibit the cell motility while ENST00000537266 could not. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that lncRNAs (ENST00000426615 and ENST00000537266) might be important regulators of PTC cell proliferation and motility, which might provide new insight into the understanding of PTC pathogenesis.",
