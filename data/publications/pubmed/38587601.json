  "title": "Patient perspectives on pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing for antidepressant prescribing in primary care: a qualitative description study.",
  "abstract": "Many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) try multiple antidepressants before finding one that works well and is tolerable. Pharmacogenomic (PGx) testing was developed to facilitate more efficacious prescribing. This technology has not been robustly implemented clinically. Patient perspectives are critical to policy decisions, but the views of patients with MDD about the use of PGx testing to guide antidepressant prescribing have not been extensively examined, particularly in publicly funded healthcare systems. The purpose of this qualitative description study was to produce actionable patient perspectives evidence to inform future technology assessment of PGx testing. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 21 adults with MDD for which antidepressants were indicated in Ontario, Canada, and used the Ontario Decision Determinants Framework to conduct an unconstrained deductive content analysis. Patients expressed views about the overall clinical benefit of PGx testing in depression care, preferences for deployment of testing, perspectives on ethical considerations, opinions about equity and patient care, and beliefs regarding the feasibility of adopting PGx testing into the healthcare system. They also worried about the possibility of conflicts of interest between PGx test manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies. This study provides policymakers with patient priorities to facilitate the development of patient-centred policies. It highlights that formal adoption of PGx testing into the healthcare system requires a focus on equity of access and health outcomes.",
