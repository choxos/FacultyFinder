  "title": "Hybrid Glenoid Designs in Anatomic Total Shoulder Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hybrid glenoid components in total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) utilize both polyethylene and metal components to provide short-term stability and long-term biologic fixation through bone ingrowth. QUESTIONS/PURPOSE: We sought to systematically review the literature for studies that assessed outcomes of TSA performed using hybrid glenoid components. METHODS: PubMed, Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Embase were searched systematically for articles measuring clinical and patient-reported outcomes and rates of complication and revision following TSA using a hybrid glenoid component. RESULTS: Seven studies with 593 shoulders were included in this review. The mean age of patients was 65 ± 1 years, and 46% of the population was male. Mean follow-up was 50 months (4.2 years). The overall complication rate was 7% and rate of revision was 2.5%; glenoid radiolucency was present in 33% of shoulders at mean follow-up of 50 months. Mean improvements in forward elevation, external rotation, internal rotation score, and abduction were 49°, 28°, 2 points, and 42°, respectively. Mean improvements in Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES), and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) scores were 36 points, 52 points, and 17 points, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our review found that TSA using hybrid glenoid components results in low rates of complication and revision at early follow-up. Long-term studies are warranted to understand more fully the role of hybrid glenoid components in TSA.",
