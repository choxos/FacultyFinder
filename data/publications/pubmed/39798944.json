  "title": "Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation for upper limb spasticity after stroke: effect and feasibility-a randomised pilot study.",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: Limb spasticity is a common issue among stroke patients. Transcutaneous electrical acupoint stimulation (TEAS) is recommended as an alternative therapy for managing upper limb spasticity after stroke; however, its potential effects and feasibility remain uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the potential effects and feasibility of TEAS on motor function in patients with upper limb spasticity after stroke. METHODS: This randomised controlled, double-blined pilot study was conducted in two phases. All the patients were randomly divided into two groups: the TEAS group and the sham TEAS group. The intervention period for both TEAS and sham TEAS was 6 weeks, with each session lasting 30â€‰min and conducted thrice weekly. The outcomes measured were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) score, the effective improvement rate, the modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), the visual analogue scale (VAS), the Barthel index (BI) and the surface electromyography (sEMG). RESULTS: All participants completed the course of therapy. Baseline characteristics were comparable across the two groups. Compared with the sham TEAS group, the TEAS group showed significant increases in FMA-UE score (P value=0.013), WMFT score (P value=0.001) and BI score (P value=0.008) at week 6. For integrated electromyogram (p=0.048) and root mean square of the biceps (p=0.033), lower scores were identified in the TEAS group compared with the sham TEAS group with a significant difference at week 6. CONCLUSION: TEAS was acceptable and feasible in participants with upper limb spasticity after stroke. A pivotal study of this therapy is justified.",
