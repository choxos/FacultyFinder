  "title": "Success of a steroid-minimization immunosuppression protocol for renal transplantation in the presence of donor-specific antibodies.",
  "abstract": "Steroid-minimization regimens have gained tremendous popularity for renal Tx in the recent past since they are associated with lower metabolic complications and other adverse effects related to long-term steroid exposure. Most such protocols have been restricted to low-risk recipients due to the concern for acute rejection with steroid-minimization. Herein, we report our experience in managing a child who received a positive flow cytometry cross-match living donor kidney transplant with low titer DSA and was successfully managed using a steroid-minimization drug regimen. The purpose of our report is to make pediatric transplant care providers aware of the feasibility of using a steroid-minimization immunosuppression regimen even in children who have traditionally been perceived to be at higher risk for immunologic complications, allowing successful avoidance of steroid toxicity.",
