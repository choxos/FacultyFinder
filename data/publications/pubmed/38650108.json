  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the single upper-arm cuff oscillometric blood pressure (BP) monitor RBP-9801 developed for office and home BP measurement in the general population according to the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/European Society of Hypertension/International Organization for Standardization (AAMI/ESH/ISO) Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018). Subjects were recruited to fulfil the age, gender, BP and cuff distribution criteria of the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard in general population using the same arm sequential BP measurement method. A total of 105 subjects were recruited and 85 were analyzed. For validation criterion 1, the mean ± SD of the differences between the test device and reference BP readings was 2.3 ± 6.4/3.1 ± 5.8 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). For criterion 2, the SD of the mean BP differences between the test device and reference BP per subject was 5.24/5.03 mmHg (systolic/diastolic). The conclusion is that the RBP-9801 oscillometric device for office and home BP measurement fulfilled all the requirements of the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) in the general population and can be recommended for clinic and self-use at home.",
