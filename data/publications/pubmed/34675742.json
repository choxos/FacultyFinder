  "title": "Improving Medical Education in Hematology and Transfusion Medicine in Canada: Standards and Limitations.",
  "abstract": "The paradigm of medical education is evolving with the introduction of competency-based medical education (CBME) and it is crucial that residency programs adapt. In this paper, we provide an overview of the current status of medical education in Hematology in Canada including models of training, assessment methods, anticipated challenges, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also discuss additional training that can be pursued after a Hematology residency, with a particular focus On Transfusion Medicine as it was one of the first programs to implement a competency-based curriculum. Finally, we explore the future directions of medical education in Hematology and Transfusion Medicine.",
