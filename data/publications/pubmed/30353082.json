  "title": "Factors influencing decision making in neonatology: inhaled nitric oxide in preterm infants.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We studied decision making regarding inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in preterm infants with Pulmonary Hypertension (PH). STUDY DESIGN: We asked members of the AAP-Society of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine and Division-Chiefs to select from three management options- initiate iNO, engage parents in shared decision making or not consider iNO in an extremely preterm with PH followed by rating of factors influencing their decision. RESULTS: Three hundred and four respondents (9%) completed the survey; 36.5% chose to initiate iNO, 42% to engage parents, and 21.5% did not consider iNO. Provider's prior experience, safety, and patient-centered care were rated higher by those who initiated or offered iNO; lack of effectiveness and cost considerations by participants who did not chose iNO. CONCLUSIONS: Most neonatologists offer or initiate iNO therapy based on their individual experience. The minority who chose not to consider iNO placed higher value on lack of effectiveness and cost. These results demonstrate a tension between evidence and pathophysiology-based-therapy/personal experience.",
