  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with hematologic malignancy (HM) commonly develop critical illness. Their long-term survival and functional outcomes have not been well described. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study of HM patients admitted to seven Canadian intensive care units (ICUs) (2018-2020). We followed survivors at 7 days, 6 months and 12 months following ICU discharge. The primary outcome was 12-month survival. We evaluated functional outcomes at 6 and 12 months using the functional independent measure (FIM) and short form (SF)-36 as well as variables associated with 12-month survival. RESULTS: We enrolled 414 patients including 35% women. The median age was 61 (interquartile range, IQR: 52-69), median Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 9 (IQR: 6-12), and 22% had moderate-severe frailty (clinical frailty scale [CFS] ≥ 6). 51% had acute leukemia, 38% lymphoma/multiple myeloma, and 40% had received a hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT). The most common reasons for ICU admission were acute respiratory failure (50%) and sepsis (40%). Overall, 203 (49%) were alive 7 days post-ICU discharge (ICU survivors). Twelve-month survival of the entire cohort was 21% (43% across ICU survivors). The proportion of survivors with moderate-severe frailty was 42% (at 7 days), 14% (6 months), and 8% (12 months). Median FIM at 7 days was 80 (IQR: 50-109). Physical function, pain, social function, mental health, and emotional well-being were below age- and sex-matched population scores at 6 and 12 months. Frailty, allogeneic HCT, kidney injury, and cardiac complications during ICU were associated with lower 12- month survival. CONCLUSIONS: 49% of all HM patients were alive at 7 days post-ICU discharge, and 21% at 12 months. Survival varied based upon hematologic diagnosis and frailty status. Survivors had important functional disability and impairment in emotional, physical, and general well-being.",
