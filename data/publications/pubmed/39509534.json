  "title": "Endoscopic Treatment of Proximal Vastus Lateralis Myo-Aponeurosis Rupture in a Professional Skier: A Case Report.",
  "abstract": "CASE: We present the case of a 33-year-old World Cup giant slalom skier treated by endoscopically assisted proximal vastus lateralis (VL) release for persistent lateral thigh pain, due to a VL proximal myo-aponeurosis rupture. At the completion of rehabilitation, he was able to return to Olympic-level competition following surgery and was still symptom free at the 3-year follow-up. CONCLUSION: The unusual location of this injury and the symptoms and physical examination are of interest. The endoscopic release of the VL proximal insertion allowed a rapid and lasting result with a return to competitive skiing at an elite level.",
