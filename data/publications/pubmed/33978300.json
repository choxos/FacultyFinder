  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: With increasing prevalence of childhood obesity worldwide, the incidence of pediatric-onset type 2 diabetes (T2D) is also increasing in many countries. We aim to analyze the time trend and incidence of T2D in children in Hong Kong from 2008 to 2017, and to characterize clinical characteristics at diagnosis. METHODS: Data were retrieved from the Hong Kong Childhood Diabetes Registry. All children with T2D diagnosed at the age of less than 18 years from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2017 and managed in the public health care system were included in this study. RESULTS: In the incident years of 2008-2017 period, 391 children were diagnosed with T2D. The crude incidence rate was 3.42 per 100,000 persons/year [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.08-3.76], which was much higher than that in last registry of 1.27 per 100,000 persons/year in 1997-2007 (P < 0.001).Most children (76%) were asymptomatic and were diagnosed by routine screening. At presentation, a significant proportion presented with co-morbidities including fatty liver (37.9%), dyslipidaemia (35.3%), hypertension (22.5%), and microalbuminuria (12.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of T2D in children has increased significantly in Hong Kong. Most of them were asymptomatic and picked up on routine health screening. Yet, comorbidities were commonly identified at diagnosis.",
