  "title": "Expression of 5-lipoxygenase in pulmonary artery endothelial cells.",
  "abstract": "Increased expression of 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) has been observed in disease states such as pulmonary hypertension and allergen challenge. To understand the function of endothelial 5LO, we examined the expression of this enzyme in normally cultured human PAECs and its characteristics when overexpressed. A small amount of 5LO message and protein was detected by reverse-transcriptase-mediated PCR (RT-PCR) and Western blotting in PAECs. Sequencing of the RT-PCR products that overlapped the entire coding region of 5LO mRNA indicated that the sequence of PAEC 5LO was identical with that of leucocyte 5LO. Incubation of the PAECs with A23187 and arachidonic acid led to a small production of 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) (46-98 pmol/4x10(6) cells) but no leukotrienes. Overexpression of 5LO in PAECs by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer revealed that the enzyme was localized in the nucleus. Incubation of the transduced cells with A23187 (5 microM) caused the production of both 5LO products and downstream leukotrienes. The proportions of the produced leukotriene A(4) (LTA(4)) hydrolates (sum of 6-trans-LTB(4) and 12-epi-6-trans-LTB(4)), LTB(4) and cysteinyl leukotriene were approx. 17:14:10. cGMP production in the 5LO-transduced PAECs was decreased by 33+/-14% on stimulation with A23187. These results show that cultured PAECs express a minimal amount of 5LO, which can generate some 5-HETE, but not leukotrienes. However, increased expression of 5LO in PAECs can lead to the production of all downstream leukotrienes, which could potentially cause endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary vasculature.",
