  "abstract": "Peer support is a promising approach to increasing hope, engagement, and connection for those with eating disorders (EDs). Emerging literature explores peer mentors' experiences of providing support, suggesting that mentors often benefit from providing peer support, particularly when well trained and supervised. We conducted semi-structured interviews or focus groups with 15 individuals providing peer support (one-on-one, group, or chat) to individuals with EDs. We identified 3 themes using reflexive thematic analysis (RTA) through a critical realist lens. Participants emphasized the importance of ongoing training and support to help them deliver high-quality peer support. They highlighted the importance of value-alignment in this work in terms of organizational valuing of lived experience and alignment with social justice. Participants reflected on how doing this work contributed to a sense of \"giving back\" and providing the kind of support they wished they had experienced. Providing peer support was described as emotion work; a challenging and rewarding experience for peer mentors. Findings carry implications for integrating peer support into the continuum of care for EDs, providing insight into approaches that can support peer support delivery in a way that promotes safety for those providing and receiving it.",
