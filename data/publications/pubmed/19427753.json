  "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between sex, race, and preoperative function in a large diverse patient population undergoing hip and knee arthroplasty. An observational study was conducted on 3542 consecutive primary unilateral total hip and knee arthroplasties. Harris Hip and Knee Society Scores were used to quantify preoperative function. The results demonstrate lower function, with average Harris Hip Scores that were 4.9 (P < .0001) and 8.77 (P < .001) and average Knee Society Scores that were 6.03 (P < .06) and 12.8 (P < .001) points lower in African American and Hispanic patients than white patients for the population, respectively. This study demonstrates that Hispanic and African American patients have worse preoperative hip and knee function before arthroplasty than white patients. Future efforts to elucidate the reasons for this decreased function as well as efforts to rectify any disparities should target these patient populations.",
