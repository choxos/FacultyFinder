  "title": "The potential for use of gastropod molluscs as bioindicators of endocrine disrupting compounds in the terrestrial environment.",
  "abstract": "Most early studies of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) investigated the effects of single compounds on vertebrate species but, more recently, the focus has changed to the study of effects of multiple chemicals on many species, including invertebrates. The widening of the range of species studied is critical to understanding the consequences of EDC effects on ecosystem function and sustainability. Much work on invertebrates has focussed on the aquatic environment, where molluscs have been used as effective bioindicators for EDCs. Although molluscs have been used to assess effects of potentially toxic metals (PTMs) in terrestrial environments, they have seldom been considered as potential indicators of EDC effects. In this paper key findings in vertebrate and invertebrate animal models are reviewed and discussed, the need to study different animal groups is highlighted and the potential value of terrestrial gastropod molluscs for biomonitoring of EDC effects in a range of terrestrial ecosystems is discussed. It is concluded that their role within the ecosystem and their ease of study in the field and laboratory signify their suitability as bioindicators.",
