  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) of pertuzumab across clinical trials in a variety of solid tumors, evaluate the potential impact of patient characteristics on PK, and confirm the appropriateness of the fixed (non-weight-based) dose. METHODS: Pertuzumab concentration data collected following intravenous administration during eleven phase I/II studies and the pivotal phase III trial CLEOPATRA were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. The potential impact of patient and laboratory characteristics and HER2 target-related variables on pertuzumab PK were investigated in a covariate analysis. The final model was used to confirm selection of fixed, non-weight-based dosing of pertuzumab, and to compare pertuzumab PK in CLEOPATRA with the other studies. RESULTS: The analysis included 4,525 serum concentration measurements from 481 patients with solid tumors. Pertuzumab PK in the 2-25 mg/kg dose range was described by a two-compartment linear model with first-order elimination. The elimination clearance and central compartment volume were 0.235 L/day, and 3.11 L, respectively, and the terminal elimination half-life was 18.0 days. Baseline serum albumin and lean body weight had statistically significant effects on pertuzumab clearance; however, simulations showed that the magnitude of their effects on pertuzumab exposure was minimal compared with overall variability and was not clinically relevant. Thus, variations in these factors do not require dose adjustments. CONCLUSIONS: The fixed, non-weight-based dosing of pertuzumab, 840 mg loading dose followed by a 420 mg maintenance dose every 3 weeks, in patients with the solid tumors in this analysis is well supported by the population pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation results.",
