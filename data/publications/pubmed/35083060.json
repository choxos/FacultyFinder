  "title": "Clinical Outcomes With Medium Cut-Off Versus High-Flux Hemodialysis Membranes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A novel medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzer (Theranova, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, USA) enhances large middle molecule clearance while retaining selectivity for molecules >45 000 Da. OBJECTIVE: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating clinical outcomes with MCO vs high-flux membranes. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science through July 2020, and gray literature sources from 2017. We included randomized (RS) and nonrandomized studies (NRS) comparing MCO and high-flux membranes in adults receiving maintenance hemodialysis. Pairs of reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment in duplicate. We conducted random-effects pairwise meta-analyses to pool results across studies and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to assess evidence certainty. RESULTS: We identified 22 eligible studies (6 RS, 16 NRS; N = 1811 patients; patient-years = 1546). The MCO dialyzer improved (estimate; 95% confidence interval [CI]; certainty rating) quality of life (mean difference [MD] = 16.7/100 points; 6.9 to 26.4; moderate), Kidney Disease Quality of Life Instrument (KDQOL) subscales-burden (MD = 4.0; 1.1 to 6.9; moderate) and effects (MD = 5.4; 3.2 to 7.6; moderate), pruritus (MD = -4.4; -7.1 to -1.7; moderate), recovery time (MD = -420 minutes; -541 to -299; high), and restless legs syndrome (odds ratio = 0.39; 0.29 to 0.53; moderate). There was little to no difference in all-cause mortality (risk difference = -0.4%; -2.8 to 2.1; moderate) and serious adverse events (rate ratio = 0.63; 0.38 to 1.04; low). MCO dialysis reduced hospitalization (rate ratio = 0.48; 0.27 to 0.84; low), infection (rate ratio = 0.38; 0.17 to 0.85; moderate), hospitalization days (MD = -1.5 days; 95% CI, -2.22 to -0.78; moderate), erythropoiesis resistance index (MD = -2.92 U/kg/week/g/L; 95% CI, -4.25 to -1.6; moderate) and cumulative iron use over 12 weeks (MD = -293 mg; 95% CI, -368 to -218; moderate). We found with low certainty that MCO dialysis had little to no effect on KDQOL symptoms/problem list, pain, and physical health and moderate certainty that MCO dialysis likely has no effect on the KDQOL mental health composite. CONCLUSIONS: We found with predominantly moderate certainty that the MCO dialyzer improves several patient-important outcomes with no apparent risks or harms. More definitive studies are needed to better quantify the effects of MCO membranes on mortality, hospitalization, and other rare events.",
