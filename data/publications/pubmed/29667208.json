  "title": "The use of cardiac-CT alone to exclude left atrial thrombus before atrial fibrillation ablation: Efficiency, safety, and cost analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing financial burden on the healthcare system. Cardiac computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) is needed for pulmonary vein mapping before AF ablation (AFA). CCTA has shown to be an alternative to transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) to rule out left atrial appendage thrombus (LAAT) pre-AFA. We aim to examine the safety, cost-effectiveness, and time-efficiency of utilizing CCTA alone to rule out LAAT before AFA. METHODS: We prospectively screened patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing cryoablation. CCTA with delayed enhancement was performed within 72 hours of AFA. Once LAAT was ruled out, patients were enrolled and planned TEE was cancelled. A retrospective control cohort that had both CCTA and TEE prior to AFA was identified. Direct cost data, electrophysiology laboratory utilization time, and 30-day stroke outcomes were collected from the EMR, follow-up phone calls, or clinic visits, and comparative analyses were performed. RESULTS: Seventy patients met the inclusion criteria in the prospective CCTA-only cohort, and 71 for the retrospective CCTA+TEE cohort. Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups. There was a nonsignificant reduction in overall cost ($15,870 ± 1,710 vs $16,557 ± 2,508, P = 0.06) in CCTA-only cohort, whereas the electrophysiology laboratory utilization time was significantly reduced (241.6 ± 41.7 vs 181.3 ±36.4 minutes, P < 0.001). There were no strokes reported on 30-day follow-up in the CCTA-only group. CONCLUSIONS: In low-to-intermediate stroke risk patients with paroxysmal AF undergoing cryoablation, eliminating TEE and employing CCTA-only strategy to rule-out LAAT improves electrophysiology laboratory efficiency without influencing periprocedural cost or increasing postprocedural stroke risk.",
