  "title": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia: NHLBI Workshop on the Primary Prevention of Chronic Lung Diseases.",
  "abstract": "Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common complication of extreme preterm birth. Infants who develop BPD manifest aberrant or arrested pulmonary development and can experience lifelong alterations in cardiopulmonary function. Despite decades of promising research, primary prevention of BPD has proven elusive. This workshop report identifies current barriers to the conduct of primary prevention studies for BPD and causal pathways implicated in BPD pathogenesis. Throughout, we highlight promising areas for research to improve understanding of normal and aberrant lung development, distinguish BPD endotypes, and ascertain biomarkers for more targeted therapeutic approaches to prevention. We conclude with research recommendations and priorities to accelerate discovery and promote lung health in infants born preterm.",
