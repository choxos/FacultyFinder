  "title": "Surgical Management of Meningiomas Involving the Torcula, Transverse Sinus, and Jugular Bulb: A Technical Note and Review of the Literature.",
  "abstract": "Meningiomas that invade the confluens sinuum are rare and require extensive preoperative planning. Here, we describe the surgical and radio-oncological management of an aggressive large occipital meningioma invading the superior sagittal sinus, torcula, right and left transverse sinus down to the level of the jugular bulb in a 21-year-old female patient. Details of the surgical approach are presented to highlight the planned staged resection of this tumor at the level of the torcula to initially debulk the lesion while preserving venous outflow through the patent's sinus. Once the tumor fully occluded the confluens, a second-stage en bloc resection ensued. Postsurgical adjuvant radiation therapy was delivered via fractionated external beam therapy which has provided local control of the tumor since. This case is being discussed in the context of the pertinent literature to demonstrate the highly complex interdisciplinary and staged management of partially intravascular meningiomas involving the major venous sinuses.",
