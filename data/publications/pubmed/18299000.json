  "title": "The use of cost-effectiveness analysis in plastic surgery clinical research.",
  "abstract": "The goal of this article is to introduce clinical investigators to the basic concepts of cost-effectiveness analysis. This line of research is not commonly pursued in clinical studies probably because of unfamiliarity of plastic surgeons with the field of health economics and health research methodology in general. The authors believe that the coupling of cost-effectiveness analysis with clinical studies is important and should be incorporated into surgical clinical research.",
