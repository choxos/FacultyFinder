  "title": "Provider Perspectives on Medication for AUD in Mental Health and Substance Use Disorder Clinics.",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is comorbid with major mental illnesses, but prescribing rates for medications for AUD (mAUD) are low. Methods: We surveyed 71 mental health and 42 substance use disorder (SUD) treatment providers in an academic medical center about AUD treatment practices. Results: Fifty-three mental health and 14 SUD providers responded. Among the n = 22 mental health prescribers, a minority (29%) prescribed mAUD often. Sixty percent of mental health providers viewed mAUD as effective. Barriers to mAUD prescribing in mental health included believing SUD providers were better equipped to prescribe mAUD, whereas SUD providers assumed that patients were not interested in mAUD. All providers were willing to participate in mAUD education initiatives, but few were willing to engage in more time-intensive implementation activities. Conclusions: Improving knowledge and attitudes may improve mental health provider delivery of mAUD, but evidence-based strategies for improving prescribing may be less acceptable and feasible for providers.",
