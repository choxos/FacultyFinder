  "title": "Chlamydia screening--Australia should strive to achieve what others have not.",
  "abstract": "Chlamydia screening programs overseas have failed to reduce chlamydia prevalence despite screening 20%-30% of young sexually active women. The Australian federal government announced in 2005 that it would provide $12.5 million for chlamydia control. Policymakers must look to chlamydia screening programs in other countries to learn from their experience. Australia has an excellent primary health care system and a strong track record in establishing highly successful public health programs. This experience places it in a strong position to design and implement an innovative chlamydia screening program to reduce chlamydia prevalence.",
