  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of a multifaceted behavior-change strategy on inappropriate use of frozen plasma (FP) transfusions in the intensive care unit (ICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, time-series study was conducted in a 15-bed medical-surgical ICU in 3 phases: (1) baseline observation; (2) educational campaign, audit and feedback to prescribers, and implementation of an FP request form; and (3) FP request form only. Independently, in triplicate and blinded to study phase, appropriateness of each FP request was adjudicated based on published guidelines and clinical context. RESULTS: Over the 15-month study period, 626 FP transfusions (210 FP requests) were administered to 88 patients. Inappropriate FP requests decreased slightly from phases I to III (60% vs 46%; P = .09), FP requests that were consistent with the guidelines did not change (23% vs 22%; P = .86), and FP requests that were appropriate for the ICU yet inconsistent with the guidelines increased (17% vs 32%; P = .04). Although uptake of the FP request form decreased in phase III, it was associated with fewer inappropriate transfusions. CONCLUSIONS: The behavior-change strategy modestly improved appropriate use of FP transfusions in the ICU. Improving FP request form accuracy, completeness, and compliance may be required to achieve maximum effect and ensure sustainability.",
