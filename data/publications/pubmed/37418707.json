  "title": "Record High 36 K Transition Temperature to the Superconducting State of Elemental Scandium at a Pressure of 260 GPa.",
  "abstract": "Elemental materials provide clean and fundamental platforms for studying superconductivity. However, the highest superconducting critical temperature (T_{c}) yet observed in elements has not exceeded 30 K. Discovering elemental superconductors with a higher T_{c} is one of the most fundamental and challenging tasks in condensed matter physics. In this study, by applying high pressure up to approximately 260 GPa, we demonstrate that the superconducting transition temperature of elemental scandium (Sc) can be increased to 36 K from the transport measurement, which is a record-high T_{c} for superconducting elements. The pressure dependence of T_{c} implies the occurrence of multiple phase transitions in Sc, which is in agreement with previous x-ray diffraction results. Optimization of T_{c} is achieved in the Sc-V phase, which can be attributed to the strong coupling between d electrons and moderate-frequency phonons, as suggested by our first-principles calculations. This study provides insights for exploring new high-T_{c} elemental metals.",
