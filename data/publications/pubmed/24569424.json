  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The present study was undertaken to assess the health-related quality of life in patients with Dupuytren's disease who undergo palmar fasciectomy. METHODS: A prospective cohort of patients with Dupuytren's disease undergoing palmar and/or digital fasciectomy was recruited from the practice of three plastic surgeons in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. After written informed consent was obtained, participants were asked to complete three health-related quality-of-life questionnaires (i.e., Short Form-36, Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire, and Health Utility Index Mark 3) at five time points: at 1 week and 1 day preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Ranges of motion and grip strength measurement were also recorded. RESULTS: For the 26 patients in the study, the multiattribute scores of the Health Utility Index Mark 3 improved from 0.80 before surgery to 0.83 at 12 months postoperatively (p > 0.05). There was no difference in the Short Form-36 scores, but the Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire scores improved from 74 at 1 week preoperatively to 90 at the 12-month postoperative visit (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo palmar fasciectomy for Dupuytren's disease experience a substantial improvement in their health-related quality of life 12 months after surgery. In the authors' study population, a benefit of 0.85 quality-adjusted life-year within 12 months was observed. This can be translated as follows: the average patient who undergoes palmar fasciectomy gains the equivalent of approximately 14.4 days (0.48 months) in perfect health by undergoing palmar fasciectomy.
