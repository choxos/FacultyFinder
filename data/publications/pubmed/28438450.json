  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There are various possible methods of skin closure in total hip arthroplasty (THA) through a lateral skin incision. The cost and time required for each can vary between techniques. The objective of this study was to determine whether there is a difference in patient and surgeon rating of scar outcome using a combination of subcuticular suture and skin adhesive (subcuticular MONOCRYL and DERMABOND [SMD]) vs staples for skin closure after THA. METHODS: Patients undergoing THA were recruited from a university hospital. Patients were randomized to staples or SMD. Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale data were collected postoperatively. In addition, visual analog scale pain scores, wound drainage, length of stay, time to closure, and total cost were collected. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients were available for final analysis. There was no significant difference in Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale scores at 6 weeks or 3 months (P = .71). There was no difference in visual analog scale pain scores (P = .64, P = .49). The staple group had a higher rate of discharge on postoperative days 1 and 3 (P < .001, P < .001) but had a 1.6-minute shorter time of closure (P < .001). There was no significant difference in length of stay or total cost (P = .5). CONCLUSION: Although there are some small initial advantages to each method of skin closure, there is little difference in scar outcome when comparing SMD and staples.",
