  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Visit-to-visit variability in single biological measurements has been associated with cognitive decline and an elevated risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). However, the effect of visit-to-visit variability in multiple biological measures is underexplored. We investigated the effect of visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), weight, fasting plasma glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides on cognitive performance and CVD. METHODS: Data on BP, HR, weight, glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides from study visits in the Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN) trial were used to estimate the association between visit-to-visit variability, cognitive performance (Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score) and CVD (non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular death). Visit-to-visit variation for each measurement was estimated by calculating each individuals visit-to-visit standard deviation for that measurement. Participants whose standard deviation was in the highest quarter were classified as having high variation. Participants were grouped into those having 0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥ 4 high variation measurements. Regression and survival models were used to estimate the association between biological measures with MMSE and CVD with adjustment for confounders and mean measurement value. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, higher visit-to-visit variability in BP, HR, weight, and FPG were associated with poorer MMSE and a higher risk of CVD. Effect sizes did not vary greatly by measurement. The effects of high visit-to-visit variability were additive; compared to participants who had no measurements with high visit-to-visit variability, those who had high visit-to-visit variability in ≥4 measurements had poorer MMSE scores (-0.63 (95 % CI -0.96 to -0·31). Participants with ≥4 measurements with high visit-to-visit variability compared to participants with none had higher risk of CVD (hazard ratio 2.46 (95 % CI 1.63 to 3.70). CONCLUSION: Visit-to-visit variability in several measurements were associated with cumulatively poorer cognitive performance and a greater risk of CVD.",
