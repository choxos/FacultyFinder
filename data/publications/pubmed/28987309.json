  "title": "Risperidone in the Emergency Setting is Associated with More Hypotension in Elderly Patients.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Expert consensus panels have recommended risperidone as first-line treatment for agitation of psychiatric origin. However, there are few if any studies on this medication in the emergency setting. OBJECTIVES: To assess the hemodynamic effects of risperidone in an emergency department (ED) setting, stratified by age. METHODS: This is a structured chart review of all patients who received oral risperidone over a 6-year period in an ED setting, excluding patients who received this medication as a prescription refill. Vital signs were analyzed for this subset prior to and after medication administration, and changes in vital signs were stratified by age. RESULTS: The median dose of risperidone was less in patients aged > 65Â years. However, the median drop in systolic blood pressure was larger in this age group compared with younger patients. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians tend to be more cautious with dosing of risperidone to geriatric patients in the ED. Despite this, decreases in systolic blood pressure are larger and more frequent in this age group. When possible, clinicians should consider or attempt nonpharmacologic methods of agitation treatment prior to administering medications such as risperidone to elderly patients.",
