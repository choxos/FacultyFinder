  "title": "Global Trends and Regional Differences in the Burden of Infective Endocarditis, 1990-2021: An Analysis of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The study aimed to offer detailed insights into the global, regional, and national burden of IE in 2021, while also examining the temporal trends of IE from 1990 to 2021. METHODS: Data on the absolute numbers and age-standardized rates (ASR) of incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) related to IE were sourced from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2021. The estimated annual percentage changes (EAPC) of ASR were calculated to quantify the temporal trends. Furthermore, joinpoint regression models were used to identify the temporal trends and the primary joinpoint year of ASR. RESULTS: Globally, the age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for IE increased with an EAPC of 1.00 (95%CI: 0.93-1.08) from 9.35 per 100 000 population in 1990 to 12.61 per 100 000 population in 2021. Despite a rise in the absolute number of death cases and DALYs related to IE, the age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR) has remained stable (EAPC 0.06, 95%CI: -0.10-0.22), and the age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDR) has exhibited a decline (EAPC -â€‰0.34, 95%CI: -0.45-0.24) between 1990 and 2021. Males bore a higher burden of IE compared to females, with the peak burden gradually shifting towards older individuals. In 2021, the ASIR for IE exhibited an increase with the rise in socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles, with the highest ASIR observed in the high SDI region (15.77 per 100 000 population). Moreover, the highest growth rates of ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR were also noted in the high SDI region. On the other hand, the ASMR (1.34 per 100 000 population) and ASDR (40.71 per 100 000 population) for IE were relatively high in the low SDI region. Joinpoint analysis demonstrated that the ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR did not experience any sudden surges either globally or across different SDI regions after 2007. CONCLUSIONS: The burden of IE remained relatively high, characterized by a rising ASIR and a stable ASMR on a global scale. This burden was notably prominent among males, the elderly, and in the high and low SDI regions. Region-specific prevention and management strategies might be warranted to reduce the burden of IE.",
