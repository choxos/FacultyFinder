  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To describe screen time levels and determine their association with socioemotional and behavioural difficulties among preschool-aged First Nations, Métis, and Inuit children. METHOD: Data were taken from the Aboriginal Children's Survey, a nationally representative survey of 2-5-year-old Indigenous children in Canada. Socioemotional and behavioural difficulties were defined using parent/guardian reports on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted separately for First Nations, Métis, and Inuit participants, and statistically adjusted for child age, child sex, and parent/guardian education. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.002 to adjust for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Of these 2-5-year-old children (mean [M] = 3.57 years) 3,085 were First Nations (53.5%), 2,430 Métis (39.2%), and 990 Inuit (7.3%). Screen time exposure was high among First Nations (M = 2 h and 58 min/day, standard deviation [SD] = 1.89), Métis (M = 2 h and 50 min [SD = 1.83]), and Inuit children (M = 3 h and 25 min [SD = 2.20]), with 79.7% exceeding recommended guidelines (>1 h/day). After adjusting for confounders, screen time was associated with more socioemotional and behavioural difficulties among First Nations (total difficulties β = 0.15 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.19]) and Métis (β = 0.16 [95% CI, 0.12 to 0.20]) but not Inuit children (β = 0.12 [95% CI, 0.01 to 0.23]). CONCLUSIONS: Screen time exposure is high among Indigenous children in Canada, and is associated with more socioemotional and behavioural difficulties among First Nations and Métis children. Contributing factors could include enduring colonialism that resulted in family dissolution, lack of positive parental role models, and disproportionate socioeconomic disadvantage. Predictors of poor well-being should continue to be identified to develop targets for intervention to optimize the health and development of Indigenous children.",
