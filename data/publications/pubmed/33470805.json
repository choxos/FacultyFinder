  "title": "Anomalous Photoelectrical Properties through Strain Engineering Based on a Single Bent InAsSb Nanowire.",
  "abstract": "In this study, electrical and photoresponse properties of bent InAsSb nanowires (NWs) were investigated to explore the impact of bending strain on the photoelectrical properties. The corresponding morphological and structural observations demonstrate the phase segregation and strain in the core-shell zinc-blende-structured InAsSb NWs. It is found that the device made of bent InAsSb individual NW presents the switch from negative photoconductivity (NPC) and positive photoconductivity (PPC). The transformation between NPC and PPC can be achieved by not only gate voltage but also bias voltage, indicating the potential in the pervasive computing of bent InAsSb NWs. This work combines the semiconductor properties, light excitation, and piezoelectric effect of the InAsSb NWs, providing new ideas for next-generation photoelectrical nanodevices.",
