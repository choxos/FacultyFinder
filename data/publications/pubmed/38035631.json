  "title": "\"There's So Much More Support We Could Have Provided\": Child Life Specialists' Stories of the Challenges Working in Adult Oncology.",
  "abstract": "A cancer diagnosis in patients who are parents of minor children is uniquely stressful for both parents and children. Children need developmentally appropriate information and support to help reduce their fears and worries. Child life specialists (CLSs) are health professionals who work in pediatric environments to support children and families with the stress and uncertainty of illnesses. Increasingly, CLSs have been called upon to support children of patients in adult clinical environments. Our objective was to elucidate CLS caregiving narratives related to working with children of adult cancer patients. We used narrative inquiry to interview four CLSs working in adult oncology. Canadian CLSs who have experience providing care for children and families affected by parental cancer were recruited via convenience sampling. We used narrative analysis methods that included multiple close reads of the data, generating narrative themes, and noting conflicts or tensions in the data. CLSs' caregiving stories often highlighted the complexities of working in an adult oncology environment. Their narratives included challenges in providing optimal care to the children, including family-level barriers (such as parental wishes to withhold information from their children) and systemic barriers (such as late referrals and limited options for bereavement support). CLS participants identified several challenges of working with families in adult oncology. The CLSs highlighted a desire for additional institutional support for children of adult oncology patients and for themselves working in these environments in order to achieve what they believed to be optimal care.",
