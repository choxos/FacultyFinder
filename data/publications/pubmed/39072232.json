  "title": "Statistical analysis plan for the SQUEEZE trial: A trial to determine whether septic shock reversal is quicker in pediatric patients randomized to an early goal-directed fluid-sparing strategy vs. usual care (SQUEEZE).",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The SQUEEZE trial is a multicentred randomized controlled trial which seeks to determine the optimal approach to fluid resuscitation in paediatric septic shock. SQUEEZE also includes a nested translational study, SQUEEZE-D, investigating the value of plasma cell-free DNA for prediction of clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To present a pre-specified statistical analysis plan (SAP) for the SQUEEZE trial prior to finalizing the trial data set and prior to commencing data analysis. DESIGN: SQUEEZE is a pragmatic, two-arm, open-label, prospective multicentre randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Canadian paediatric tertiary care centres. PARTICIPANTS: Paediatric patients with suspected sepsis and persistent signs of shock in need of ongoing resuscitation. Sample size target: 400 participants. INTERVENTIONS: The trial is designed to compare a fluid-sparing resuscitation strategy to usual care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome for the SQUEEZE trial is the time to shock reversal (in hours). The primary outcome analysis will assess the difference in time to shock reversal between the intervention and control groups, reported as point estimate with 95% confidence intervals. The statistical test for the primary analysis will be a two-sided t-test. Secondary outcome measures include clinical outcomes and adverse events including measures of organ dysfunction and mortality outcomes. RESULTS: The SAP presented here is reflective of and where necessary clarifies in detail the analysis plan as presented in the trial protocol. The SAP includes a mock CONSORT diagram, figures and tables. Data collection methods are summarized, primary and secondary outcomes are defined, and outcome analyses are described. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a statistical analysis plan for the SQUEEZE Trial for transparency and to align with best practices. Analysis of SQUEEZE Trial data will adhere to the SAP to reduce the risk of bias. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: Definitive trial NCT03080038; Registered Feb 28, 2017.
