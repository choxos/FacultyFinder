  "abstract": "Background: Breastfeeding is not recommended for women living with HIV (WLWH) in Canada. We described the prevalence of breastfeeding and explored experiences of care, support, and stigma related to infant feeding. Setting: Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia (Canada). Methods: Data were obtained from the HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS) surveys, conducted between 2013 and 2018. Results: Breastfeeding was reported by 73.5% of the 786 women who delivered before HIV diagnosis and 7.3% of the 289 women who delivered after HIV diagnosis. Among them, earlier year of delivery, delivery outside of Canada, and African, Caribbean, Black ethnicity were independently associated with increased odds of breastfeeding. Among WLWH who had a live birth during the last year, 77% (40/52) felt that they had received support regarding infant feeding practices, and 77% (23/30) were concerned that not breastfeeding could lead to them being identified as WLWH. Among 71 women within one year postpartum at any one of the study waves, 89% reported having an undetectable viral load. Conclusion: Breastfeeding experiences were common among WLWH, most often prior to HIV diagnosis. Fear of unintentional HIV status disclosure when not breastfeeding and challenges to maintain an undetectable HIV viral load are important issues to address during postpartum care.",
