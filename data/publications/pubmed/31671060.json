  "title": "Plaque Sealing With Drug-Eluting Stents Versus Medical Therapy for Treating Intermediate Non-Obstructive Saphenous Vein Graft Lesions: A Pooled Analysis of the VELETI and VELETI II Trials.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The presence of intermediate \"non-obstructive\" saphenous vein graft (SVG) lesions is a strong predictor of cardiac events. We wanted to assess the efficacy of sealing these SVG lesions with drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation for reducing major adverse cardiac event (MACE) rate. METHODS: The present analysis is based on the pooled data from the VELETI and VELETI II randomized trials. Patients with at least 1 intermediate SVG lesion (30%-60% diameter stenosis) were randomized to DES implantation (SVG-DES) or medical treatment (SVG-MT). The primary outcome was the first occurrence of MACE, defined as the composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, or coronary revascularization related to the target SVG. RESULTS: A total of 182 patients were included (mean age, 70 ± 9 years), with 90 and 92 patients allocated to the SVG-DES and SVG-MT groups, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 4 ± 1 years, patients in the SVG-MT group exhibited a higher rate of MACE related to the target SVG (23.9% vs 17.8% in the SVG-DES group; P=.04) and MACE related to the target SVG lesion (21.7% vs 12.2% in the SVG-DES group; P<.01). In the multivariable analysis, a higher total cholesterol value at baseline (P=.04) was the only independent predictor of SVG disease progression leading to clinical events. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting and intermediate non-obstructive SVG lesions, plaque sealing with DES reduced the incidence of MACE related to SVG disease progression. A higher cholesterol level was the main predictor of SVG disease progression leading to clinical events in these patients.",
