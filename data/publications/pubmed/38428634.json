  "title": "Retraining transplant pharmacy staff to reduce Medicare Part B prescription billing errors post-transplant.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Medicare Part B (MedB) imposes penalties for certain errors in prescription billing of post-transplant medications, which can greatly affect pharmacy revenue. To prevent MedB billing fines, pharmacy staff must be cognizant of specific MedB requirements. OBJECTIVE: This quality improvement project aimed to retrain certified pharmacy technicians (CPhTs) on common billing errors and evaluate changes in error rates and potential fines after retraining. We aimed to determine whether retraining CPhTs minimizes MedB prescription billing errors and reduces potential fines owed by the Vanderbilt Transplant Pharmacy (VTP) to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). METHODS: This was a single-center, quality improvement study including post-transplant patients with at least one MedB prescription billing error who filled prescriptions through VTP. All CPhTs involved in MedB prescription billing received retraining focused on the top 3 errors in MedB billing identified at VTP: early refills, missing relationship of caller to patient and residence of patient on order documentation, or no day supply remaining recorded on the order file. Retraining consisted of developing a training checklist, testing current knowledge levels, individualized nonpunitive coaching based on technician specific errors, and retesting for knowledge retention. Outcomes included the number of prescriptions with at least one MedB prescription billing error and the projected amount of dollars fined owing to errors recorded during the 3 months before and 3 months after retraining. RESULTS: Fourteen CPhTs received retraining. Average refill too soon errors decreased by 37.5% (10.7% vs. 6.7%), average missing relationship by 21.7% (7.7% vs. 6%), and day supply errors by 39.7% (1.7% vs. 1%). Error reductions equaled a 28.2% decrease (approximately $12,700) in potential fines. CONCLUSION: Retraining focused on MedB billing error successfully reduced error frequency and fines from CMS. MedB billing error fines can be costly for pharmacies dispensing high-cost medications; therefore, identifying common errors and training staff can be useful and financially prudent.",
