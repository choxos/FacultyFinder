  "title": "Ten Years of Inaction on Antimicrobial Resistance: An Environmental Scan of Policies in Canada from 2008 to 2018.",
  "abstract": "We surveyed Canadian healthcare experts to identify policies to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Canada between 2008 and 2018. Respondents identified AMR policy interventions implemented in Canada during the previous 10 years. Additional policies were identified through systematic searches of seven electronic databases and a review of government documents. Fifty-two unique policies were identified, with at least one policy in most provinces and territories. This environmental scan suggests that Canadian AMR efforts are disjointed and inadequate, given the urgency of this public health threat. Governments have mostly refrained from using more powerful policy tools, including regulation, legislation and fiscal measures.",
