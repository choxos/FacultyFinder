  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Develop and evaluate the preliminary validity of a self-report measure of parents' treatment-related efficacy and control, Parental Efficacy and Control Questionnaire-Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (PECQ-HCT), in a pediatric HCT sample. METHODS: Participants included 185 parents of children (≤12 years old) receiving HCT participating in a larger, longitudinal study. Parents completed the PECQ-HCT as well as measures of social problem-solving skills, collective family efficacy, family beliefs, and parental distress. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis results indicated that a 37-item four-factor model was the best fitting and most theoretically sound, χ2(df = 1,596) = 14,089.95, p < .01, comparative fit index = 0.92, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.90, and root mean square error of approximation = 0.07. Preliminary subscale scores demonstrated adequate internal consistency as well as good content and criterion-related validity. CONCLUSIONS: If replicated using a confirmatory factor analysis in a separate sample, these findings suggest that the four-factor PECQ-HCT measure may be useful for measuring HCT-related parental efficacy and perceived control.",
