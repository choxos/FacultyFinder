  "title": "The Protective Effect of Sericin on AML12 Cells Exposed to Oxidative Stress Damage in a High-Glucose Environment.",
  "abstract": "Two types of sericin peptides with high molecular weight (HS) and low molecular weight (LS) were obtained by the green water boiling ultrasonic method and the Ca(OH)2 ultrasonic method, respectively. In this experiment, a high-glucose medium was used to simulate a high-glucose environment in the body, and appropriate concentrations of normal alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) hepatocytes were exposed to a series of concentrations of HS and LS. The effects of the two sericin peptides on AML12 cells in a high-glucose environment were investigated in detail in terms of oxidative stress and inflammatory factor expression in cells. HS and LS-groups reduced the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and the latter significantly reduced the levels of TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and nuclear factor (NF)-κB in AML12 cells. Additionally, it significantly reduced the oxidative stress damage caused by the high-glucose environment compared with normal AML12 cells. These results indicate that sericin may be an antioxidant recovered from industrial waste, and has potential and for use in the reduction of environmental pollution and the development of functional foods with antioxidation and antihyperglycemic effect.",
