  "title": "Measuring attributes of team functioning in primary care settings: development of the TEAMS tool.",
  "abstract": "This study examines attributes of a high-functioning primary care team by creating a survey measuring staff perceptions of team culture in primary care practices with innovative team-based workforce models. Survey data from a national study of 30 exemplar primary care practices with innovative team-based workforce models was used. Staff and clinicians (n = 943) at the 30 primary care sites completed a 31-item survey online. Survey items came from previous surveys of adaptive reserve and team culture. Factor analysis, reliability and validity were examined for the survey. Case summaries from site visits and survey comments were compared for high and low scoring sites to establish validity. Three core attributes of a high-functioning team were identified: joy in practice (4 items), personal growth (3 items), and leadership and learning (20 items). Four items did not measure any attribute. Using item correlations, the 20 items for leadership and learning were reduced to 7 items. All three attribute subscales had good reliability and validity. The final 14-item survey measuring joy in practice, personal growth and leadership and learning may be useful in clinical practice as a practical tool to gauge progress in developing a high-functioning team. Further research is needed to determine the sensitivity of this instrument to change over time with interventions designed to improve team functioning in primary care.",
