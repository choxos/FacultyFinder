  "title": "Negative Impact of Disorders of Gut-Brain Interaction on Health-Related Quality of Life: Results From the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Survey.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: This study used the database from the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology Survey to assess the differences in quality of life overall, and by age and sex, across individual disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), gastrointestinal anatomical region(s), and number of overlapping DGBI. METHODS: Data were collected via the Internet in 26 countries, using the Rome IV diagnostic questionnaire and a supplemental questionnaire including the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information Systems Global-10 quality of life measure. Factorial analyses of variance were used to explore physical and mental quality of life, adjusting for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Among the 54,127 respondents, quality of life deteriorated significantly with increasing number of overlapping DGBI, with respondents reporting ≥2 DGBI having significantly poorer quality of life than those with only 1 DGBI or those without any DGBI. Men with DGBI reported better quality of life than women, and those aged ≥65 years reported better quality of life than those <65 years. Age, sex, number of overlapping DGBI, somatization, anxiety, depression, and functional experiences (concern, embarrassment, or stress associated with bowel functioning) relating to DGBI, were significant predictors of poorer physical and mental quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the most comprehensive assessment of quality of life to date in adults living with a DGBI. It provides a representative picture of DGBI impact on adults in the global adult population and highlights the significant detrimental impact of living with a DGBI on quality of life.",
