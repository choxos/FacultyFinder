  "title": "Potential Role of Phytochemical Extract from Saffron in Development of Functional Foods and Protection of Brain-Related Disorders.",
  "abstract": "The present review is designed to measure the effects of saffron extract in functional foods and its pharmacological properties against various disorders. Saffron is a traditional medicinal plant used as a food additive. The stigma of saffron has bioactive compounds such as safranal, crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, kaempferol, and flavonoid. These bioactive compounds can be extracted using conventional (maceration, solvent extraction, soxhlet extraction, and vapor or hydrodistillation) and novel techniques (emulsion liquid membrane extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, enzyme-associated extraction, pulsed electric field extraction, microwave-assisted extraction, and supercritical fluid extraction). Saffron is used as a functional ingredient, natural colorant, shelf-life enhancer, and fortifying agent in developing different food products. The demand for saffron has been increasing in the pharma industry due to its protection against cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, and antidepressant properties. Conclusively, the phytochemical compounds of saffron improve the nutrition value of products and protect humans against various disorders.",
