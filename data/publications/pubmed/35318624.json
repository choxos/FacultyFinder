  "title": "[Transfer of Physicians' Tasks to Nurses in the Care of People with Dementia].",
  "abstract": "THE AIM OF THE STUDY: A transfer of medical activities to nurses and thus the redistribution of tasks has been discussed for almost 15 years. A legal base for model projects has been enacted. However, clearly defined tasks for substitution are still lacking. The aim of this study was to solicit opinions of general practitioners, nurses, people with dementia (PwD) and their relatives about the possibility of a large number of specific General practitioner (GP) tasks being performed by nurses in outpatient dementia care. METHODS: A mixed-methods study with a sequential in-depth design was conducted. The analysis presented here refers to the quantitative survey of the four participant groups. 865 participants were asked about the acceptance of substitution of assessments, primary and follow-up prescriptions, health monitoring measures and other activities currently performed by physicians. RESULTS: Across all groups of subjects, the highest level of approval for substitution was achieved for the assessment of mobility restrictions, everyday competencies, nutritional abnormalities, prescription of transportation, nursing aids, home nursing services and drawing of blood samples. Among PwD and relatives, the level of acceptance for substitution was very high. 88% of the PwD and relatives indicated that many activities can be substituted while the general practitioner remained their first point of contact. More GPs (63.2%) than nurses (56.7%) would accept the substitution. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that a large number of GPs, nurses, patients and their relatives welcome substitution. However, PwD and relatives have a significantly more positive attitude towards substitution.",
