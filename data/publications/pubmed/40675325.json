  "title": "Intranasal treatments for allergic rhinitis in preschool- and school-aged children: network meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intranasal medications are considered a first-line treatment of allergic rhinitis (AR). OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the efficacy and safety of intranasal antihistamines (INAH), intranasal corticosteroids (INCS) and their fixed combination (INAH+INCS) for the treatment of AR in children. METHODS: We searched four electronic bibliographic and three clinical trial databases for randomised controlled trials assessing the use of INAH, INCS and INAH+INCS in children (<18 years) with seasonal or perennial AR. We performed an NMA on the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS), Total Ocular Symptom Score (TOSS), Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), development of adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. The certainty of evidence (CoE) was assessed using GRADE-NMA. RESULTS: We included 31 studies (12,168 participants). All assessed medication classes were more effective than placebo in improving the TNSS. For seasonal AR, INAH+INCS were associated with a higher probability of a clinically relevant improvement in the TOSS and RQLQ compared with INCS alone. For the treatment of perennial AR, INCS displayed a higher probability than INAH of meaningfully improving the RQLQ. No relevant differences were found regarding safety outcomes. For the majority of comparisons, the CoE was deemed \"moderate\" or \"high\". CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal medications are effective and safe in the treatment of AR in children, although their efficacy in improving nasal symptoms does not seem to be as high as in adults. Further research is needed since the available evidence has provided mixed results depending on AR type and outcome measures assessed.",
