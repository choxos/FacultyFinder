  "title": "Cannabis or Cannabinoids for the Management of Chronic Noncancer Pain: Best Practice Advice From the American College of Physicians.",
  "abstract": "DESCRIPTION: The American College of Physicians' Population Health and Medical Science Committee (PHMSC) developed this best practice advice to inform clinicians about what is currently known about the benefits and harms of cannabis or cannabinoids in the management of chronic noncancer pain and to provide advice for clinicians counseling patients seeking this therapy. METHODS: The PHMSC considers areas where evidence is uncertain or emerging or practice does not follow the evidence to provide clinical advice based on a review and assessment of scientific work, including systematic reviews and individual studies. Sources of evidence included a living systematic review on cannabis and cannabinoid treatments for chronic noncancer pain and a series of living systematic reviews and primary studies. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1A: Clinicians should counsel patients about the benefits and harms of cannabis or cannabinoids when patients are considering whether to start or continue to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage their chronic noncancer pain. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1B: Clinicians should counsel the following subgroups of patients that the harms of cannabis or cannabinoid use for chronic noncancer pain are likely to outweigh the benefits: young adult and adolescent patients, patients with current or past substance use disorder, patients with serious mental illness, and frail patients and those at risk for falling. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Clinicians should advise against starting or continuing to use cannabis or cannabinoids to manage chronic noncancer pain in patients who are pregnant or breastfeeding or actively trying to conceive. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Clinicians should advise patients against the use of inhaled cannabis to manage chronic noncancer pain.",
