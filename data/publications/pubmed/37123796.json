  "title": "Unique Case of Cardiogenic Shock in the Setting of Cumulative Calcium Channel Blocker Toxicity.",
  "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are the most prescribed medications in clinical practice. These drugs treat many conditions, including migraine headaches, vasospasms, abnormal heart rhythms, and hypertension. This widespread use, however, has also been linked with the increased incidence of CCB toxicity cases. CCB toxicity may be from accidental ingestion or iatrogenic. Patients may show signs of cardiovascular toxicity such as hypotension, bradyarrhythmia, coma, or even death. The treatment includes discontinuing the offending medication, securing the airway, and raising blood pressure. Herein, we report a rare case of a 40-year-old male with a history of uncontrolled hypertension and advanced kidney disease who experienced iatrogenic cumulative calcium channel blocker toxicity while switching CCB classes due to a hypertensive emergency with concomitant atrial flutter. Although uncommon in clinical practice, iatrogenic CCB toxicity is possible and equally lethal. Clinicians must be cautious when initiating these drugs, switching between oral and intravenous formulations, or switching from one class to another to avoid overdoses.",
