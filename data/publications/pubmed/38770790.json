  "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline-Inconsistent Management of Fertility Preservation in Pediatric Cancer Patients in Community Settings: A Children's Oncology Group Study.",
  "abstract": "Background: The primary objective was to measure adherence to clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations for fertility preservation (FP) in pediatric cancer patients treated in National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP) sites. Secondary objectives were to describe factors such as site size associated with CPG-inconsistent care delivery and cryopreservation completion. Methods: This retrospective, multicenter study included patients 15 to 21 years old with a first cancer diagnosis from January 2014 through December 2015 who were previously enrolled to a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study and received care at a participating NCORP site. Patients were randomly selected from a list generated by the COG for chart review by participating sites. Primary outcome was care delivery that was inconsistent with a strong CPG recommendation on FP, namely discussion and offering of FP options before cancer treatment initiation, as adjudicated centrally by a panel. Results: A total of 129 patients from 25 sites were included. Among these, 48% (62/129) received CPG-inconsistent care. Most CPG-inconsistent care was due to lack of FP discussion documentation (93.5%, 58/62). Small site size, treatment at a pediatric (vs mixed adult/pediatric) site, and female sex were associated with higher odds of CPG-inconsistent care delivery. Conclusions: Newly diagnosed pediatric cancer patients often received CPG-inconsistent care for FP, with disproportionate gaps noted for females, and those treated at smaller or pediatric NCORP sites. The primary reason for CPG-inconsistent care is lack of FP discussion from clinicians. Opportunities to improve FP CPG implementation are highlighted.",
