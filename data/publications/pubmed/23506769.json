  "title": "A closer look at the BREAST-Q(©).",
  "abstract": "The BREAST-Q(©) is a multiscale, multimodule, patient-reported outcome instrument (PRO) measuring health-related quality of life and patient satisfaction in women who undergo breast surgery. This PRO instrument is the flagship of our team's research, which has spanned almost a decade. This article provides detail about the BREAST-Q(©). The BREAST-Q(©) represents a significant advance in measuring the impact and effectiveness of breast surgery from the patients' perspective. In addition, our overall approach may provide a useful template for the development of future PRO instruments.",
