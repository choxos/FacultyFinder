  "abstract": "Tick-borne pathogens harm livestock production and pose a significant risk to public health. To combat these effects, it is necessary to identify the circulating pathogens to create effective control measures. This study identified Anaplasma and Ehrlichia species in ticks collected from livestock in the Kassena-Nankana Districts between February 2020 and December 2020. A total of 1550 ticks were collected from cattle, sheep and goats. The ticks were morphologically identified, pooled and screened for pathogens using primers that amplify a 345 bp fragment of the 16SrRNA gene and Sanger sequencing. The predominant tick species collected was Amblyomma variegatum (62.98%). From the 491 tick pools screened, 34 (6.92%) were positive for Ehrlichia and Anaplasma. The pathogens identified were Ehrlichia canis (4.28%), Ehrlichia minasensis (1.63%), Anaplasma capra (0.81%) and Anaplasma marginale (0.20%). This study reports the first molecular identification of the above-mentioned Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species in ticks from Ghana. With the association of human infections with the zoonotic pathogen A. capra, livestock owners are at risk of infections, calling for the development of effective control measures.",
