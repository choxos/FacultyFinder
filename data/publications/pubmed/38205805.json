  "abstract": "The Society of Surgeons of Pakistan and The Society of Surgical Oncology of Pakistan with factions from various major centres comprising of surgical oncology, medical and radiation oncology collaborated to reach consensus on breast cancer management guidelines and a framework of \"good practice\" minimum standards of care. The aim of the task force was to enhance treatment standards, which have a direct correlation with improving patient mortality and morbidity and long-term survival whilst taking into consideration economic limitations of access to leading centers of excellence as well as minimum expertise required in health care. These multidisciplinary guidelines, whilst not exhaustive, aim to provide an algorithm of care for breast cancer patients at tertiary care centres and district level hospitals to provide most appropriate treatment.",
