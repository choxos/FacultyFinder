  "title": "Iridium(III) complex induces apoptosis in HeLa cells by regulating mitochondrial and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways: In vitro and in vivo experiments.",
  "abstract": "Cyclometalated iridium complexes with mitochondrial targeting show great potential as substitutes for platinum-based complexes because of their strong anti-cancer properties. Three novel cyclometalated iridium(III) compounds were synthesized and evaluated in five different cell lines as part of the ongoing systematic investigations of these compounds. The complexes were prepared using 4,7-dichloro-1,10-phenanthroline ligands. The cytotoxicity of complexes Ir1-Ir3 towards HeLa cells was shown to be high, with IC50 values of 0.83±0.06, 4.73±0.11, and 4.95±0.62 μM, respectively. Complex Ir1 could be ingested by HeLa cells in 3 h and has shown high selectivity toward mitochondria. Subsequent investigations demonstrated that Ir1 triggered apoptosis in HeLa cells by augmenting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and depleting ATP levels. Furthermore, the movement of cells was significantly suppressed and the progression of the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase following the administration of Ir1. The Western blot analysis demonstrated that the induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells by Ir1 involves the activation of the mitochondria-dependent channel and the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. No significant cytotoxicity was observed in zebrafish embryos at concentrations less than or equal to 16 µM, e.g., survival rate and developmental abnormalities. In vivo, antitumor assay demonstrated that Ir1 suppressed tumor growth in mice. Therefore, our work shows that complex Ir1 could be a promising candidate for developing novel antitumor drugs.",
