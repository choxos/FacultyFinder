  "title": "A Practical Guide for Primary Care Providers on Timely Diagnosis and Comprehensive Care Strategies for Hidradenitis Suppurativa.",
  "abstract": "Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic, progressive inflammatory disease of the skin with many systemic implications. Hidradenitis suppurativa is frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, particularly because of heterogeneity in presentation and low disease recognition. Patients can see multiple types of health care providers, including primary care providers, along their journey to an accurate diagnosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical presentation, associated comorbidities, and life impact associated with hidradenitis suppurativa. Disease features described here can facilitate earlier identification of hidradenitis suppurativa, differentiation from common mimickers, and timely referrals for multidisciplinary management when needed. Engagement of the medical community will also support comprehensive care strategies necessary in hidradenitis suppurativa.",
