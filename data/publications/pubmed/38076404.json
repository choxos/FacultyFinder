  "title": "Impact of extended-infusion piperacillin-tazobactam in a Canadian community hospital.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Studies have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes with extended infusion (EI) piperacillin/tazobactam (TZP) compared to standard infusion (SI). However, there is less evidence on its benefits in noncritically-ill patients. Hospital-wide EI TZP was implemented at our site on February 21, 2012. Our objectives were to compare clinical, safety and economic outcomes between EI and SI TZP. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of all adult patients who received EI TZP (3.375 g IV q8h infused over 4 hours and SI TZP for â‰¥ 48 hours during 3 years pre-and postimplementation was conducted. The primary study outcome was 14-day mortality while secondary outcomes included length of hospital stay (LOS), nursing plus pharmacy cost, occurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection, readmission within 30 days and change in Pseudomonas aeruginosa minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) distribution for TZP. The primary outcome and binary secondary outcomes were analyzed using a logistic regression model. LOS was examined using time to event analysis. Cost was examined using linear regression modelling. RESULTS: Overall, 2034 patients received EI TZP and 1364 patients received SI TZP. EI TZP was associated with lower odds of mortality (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.63-0.91), lower odds of C. difficile infection (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.41-0.84) and 8% lower cost (estimate 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) compared to SI TZP. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-wide implementation of EI TZP was associated with lower odds of 14-day mortality and incidence of C. difficile infection with cost savings at our institution.",
