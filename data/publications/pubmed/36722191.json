  "title": "The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging: A Vehicle for Research on Aging in Older Veterans.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Research on the health of older Veterans in Canada is an emerging area. Few population-based studies in Canada have included older Veterans as a specific group of interest. This paper describes a cohort of self-identified Veterans within the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using data from the CLSA baseline assessment (2011-2015), we describe sociodemographic and health characteristics along with military-related variables in a cohort of Veterans in Canada. We also estimate the number of Canadian and non-Canadian Veterans living in Canada at the time of the CLSA baseline data collection. RESULTS: We estimate that at the CLSA baseline, there were 718,893 (95% confidence interval [CI], 680,033-757,110) Canadian Veterans and 185,548 (95% CI, 165,713-205,100) non-Canadian Veterans aged 45-85 years living in Canada. Veterans were older and predominantly male compared to non-Veterans in the CLSA. Following age and sex adjustment, the distribution of sociodemographic and health characteristics was similar across all groups. The majority (> 85%) of participants in each comparison group reported self-rated general and mental health as excellent, very good, or good. Following age and sex adjustment, most characteristics across groups remained similar. One exception was mental health, where a greater proportion of Veterans screened positive for depression and anxiety relative to non-Veterans. CONCLUSIONS: Using CLSA baseline data, we estimate the number of older Veterans in Canada and present descriptive data that highlight interesting differences and similarities between Veterans and non-Veterans living in Canada. Canadian and non-Canadian Veterans in the CLSA are presented separately, with the latter group having not been previously studied in Canada. This paper presents a snapshot of a cohort of self-identified Veterans within the CLSA at study baseline and highlights the potential of the CLSA as a vehicle for studying the aging Veteran population in Canada for years to come.",
