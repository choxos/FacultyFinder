  "title": "Comparing Somatostatin Analogs in the Treatment of Advanced Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The 2 approved somatostatin analogs (SSAs) in the first-line treatment of advanced, well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NETs) are octreotide long-acting release (Sandostatin LAR) and somatuline depot (Lanreotide). The study's objective was to compare progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients (pts) with GEP-NETs treated with somatuline or octreotide LAR. Pts and Methods: Pts with advanced well-differentiated GEP-NET who received either SSA at Emory University between 1995 and 2019 were included after institutional review board approval. The primary end point was PFS, defined as time to disease progression (according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or clinical progression) or death. The secondary end point was OS. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated, and log-rank tests were conducted to compare the survival outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 105 pts were identified. The mean age was 62.1 years (SD Â± 11.8). The male-to-female ratio was 51:54. The majority (N = 69, 65.7%) were white. Most pts had grade 2 (G2) disease (N = 44, 41.9%). Primary location was small bowel in 58 (55.2%), pancreas in 27 (25.7%), and other in 20 (19.0%). Functional tumors were defined in 32 pts distributed equally between the 2 groups. Distribution of treatment was similar in the 2 groups, with 54 receiving octreotide LAR and 51 receiving somatuline depot. The median PFS for the octreotide LAR and somatuline depot groups was 12 months (95% CI, 6-18 months) and 10.8 months (95% CI, 6-15.6 months), respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.2665). For pts with G1 disease, the median PFS for the octreotide LAR and somatuline depot was 8.4 versus 32.4 months, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.159). For G2 disease, the difference in median PFS between octreotide LAR and somutaline depot groups was statistically significant (12 vs. 7.2 months, respectively; p = 0.0372). The mean follow-up time for octreotide LAR was 21.6 months versus 11.3 months for somatuline depot. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, there was no difference in PFS between octreotide LAR and somatuline depot for pts with well-differentiated, metastatic GEP-NETs. A prospective study is worth designing selecting for G.",
