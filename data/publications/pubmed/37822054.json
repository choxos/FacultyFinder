  "title": "Early humoral and cellular responses after bivalent SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273.214 vaccination in long-term care and retirement home residents in Ontario, Canada: An observational cohort study.",
  "abstract": "Immunogenicity of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) bivalent mRNA-1273.214 vaccine (Original/Omicron B.1.1.529 [BA.1]) is underreported in vulnerable older adults in congregate care settings. In residents of 26 long-term care and retirement homes in Ontario, Canada, humoral (i.e., serum anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain [anti-RBD]) IgG and IgA antibodies and live SARS-CoV-2 neutralization) and cellular (i.e., CD4[+] and CD8[+] activation-induced marker spike-specific T cell memory) responses were assessed 7-120 days postvaccination with four monovalent mRNA vaccines (n = 494) or subsequent bivalent mRNA-1273.214 vaccination (fifth vaccine) (n = 557). Within 4 months, anti-spike and anti-RBD antibody levels were similar after monovalent and bivalent vaccination in infection-na√Øve individuals. Hybrid immunity (i.e., vaccination and natural infection) generally increased humoral responses. After bivalent vaccination, compared to monovalent vaccination, residents with hybrid immunity had elevated anti-spike and anti-RBD IgG and IgA antibodies. Omicron BA.1 antibody-mediated neutralization, and CD8[+] T cell memory responses to the Omicron BA.1 spike protein, were also higher after bivalent vaccination. Humoral and cellular responses were, therefore, noninferior within 4 months of bivalent mRNA-1273.214 vaccination compared to monovalent mRNA vaccination. Waning of humoral but not cellular immunity was particularly evident in individuals without hybrid immunity. Continued monitoring of vaccine-associated and hybrid immunity against emerging Omicron variants of concern is necessary to assess longevity of protection.",
