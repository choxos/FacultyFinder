  "title": "A case report of mesenteric involvement in neurofibromatosis type 1.",
  "abstract": "Mutations in the Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF-1) gene, which is located on chromosome 17q11.2, are the cause of NF-1, an autosomal dominant hereditary condition in which tumors of the nerve system develop. Neurological, skeletal, and cutaneous abnormalities are symptoms of the condition. Of all gastrointestinal tract lesions, mesentery lesions are the least common. There are many gastrointestinal problems that can accompany mesenteric neurofibromas, or they may not. We describe a case of a 5-year-old kid with mesenteric neurofibromatosis, which results in bowel obstruction and abdominal discomfort. On a CT scan, the mesenteric vasculature was completely encircled by homogenous soft tissue lesions without any vessel wall invasion. Diffuse mesentery lesions were discovered during surgery, although they could not be fully removed.",
