  "title": "Emerging trends in biological therapy for intervertebral disc degeneration.",
  "abstract": "Intervertebral disc disease is characterized by a series of deleterious changes in cellularity that lead to loss of extracellular matrix structure, altered biomechanical loading, and symptomatic pain. At present the \"gold standard\" of therapy is discectomy -- surgical removal of the diseased disc followed by fusion of the adjacent vertebral bodies. The procedure alleviates pain, but fusion limits range of motion and alters the mechanical loading at other spinal levels, hastening disease at previously unaffected sites. Biological therapeutics have the potential to repair damaged tissue by several means: (1) altering cell phenotype to regenerate matrix components, (2) augmenting tissue with reparative cells, (3) delivering bioactive materials to reestablish disc biomechanics and serve as a template for cell-based regeneration. Although research into biological treatments for disc degeneration has been ongoing for over a decade, few treatments have progressed to clinical testing and none are currently commercially available, primarily due to a limited understanding of disease etiology. Further work is needed to identify targets and interventional time points as disc degeneration progresses from early to later stages. This review focuses on emerging trends in biological treatments and identifies key obstacles to their clinical translation.",
