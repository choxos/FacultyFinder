  "abstract": "B cells are key contributors to chronic autoimmune pathology in multiple sclerosis (MS). Clonally related B cells exist in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meninges, and CNS parenchyma of MS patients. We sought to investigate the presence of clonally related B cells over time by performing Ig heavy chain variable region repertoire sequencing on B cells from longitudinally collected blood and CSF samples of MS patients (n = 10). All patients were untreated at the time of the initial sampling; the majority (n = 7) were treated with immune-modulating therapies 1.2 (±0.3 SD) years later during the second sampling. We found clonal persistence of B cells in the CSF of 5 patients; these B cells were frequently Ig class-switched and CD27+. Specific blood B cell subsets appear to provide input into CNS repertoires over time. We demonstrate complex patterns of clonal B cell persistence in CSF and blood, even in patients on immune-modulating therapy. Our findings support the concept that peripheral B cell activation and CNS-compartmentalized immune mechanisms can in part be therapy resistant.",
