  "title": "Xarelto plus Acetylsalicylic acid: Treatment patterns and Outcomes in patients with Atherosclerosis (XATOA): Rationale and design of a prospective registry study to assess rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin for prevention of atherothrombotic events in coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, or both.",
  "abstract": "Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral artery disease (PAD), or both remain at risk of cardiovascular events (including peripheral ischemic events), even when they receive the current guideline-recommended treatment. The phase III COMPASS trial demonstrated that treatment with rivaroxaban vascular dose 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin (dual pathway inhibition [DPI] regimen) significantly reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (including peripheral ischemic events) and increased the risk of major bleeding, but not fatal bleeding or intracranial hemorrhage, versus aspirin alone in patients with CAD, PAD, or both. The results of the COMPASS trial supported the regulatory approval of the DPI regimen in several geographic regions. However, it is unclear whether the patients selected for treatment with the DPI regimen in clinical practice will have a similar risk profile and event rates compared with the COMPASS trial population. The prospective post-approval XATOA registry study aims to assess treatment patterns, as well as ischemic and bleeding outcomes in patients with CAD, PAD, or both, who receive DPI therapy in routine clinical practice. Up to 10,000 patients from at least 400 centers in 22 countries will be enrolled and followed up for a minimum of 12 months, and all treatment will be at the discretion of the prescribing physician. The primary objective of the XATOA study will be to describe early treatment patterns, while ischemic and bleeding outcomes will be described as a secondary objective.
