  "title": "Inhibition of rat aortic smooth muscle contraction by 2-methoxyestradiol.",
  "abstract": "Recent studies suggest that 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME), an estrogen metabolite, has a similar inhibitory effect as 17beta-estradiol (E2) on vascular tone. However, it is not known whether 2-ME mediates the effects of E2 or by what mechanism 2-ME regulates smooth muscle contraction. Therefore, we compared the effects of 2-ME and E2 on rat aortic smooth muscle contraction. A preincubation with 2-ME (10 microM) for 1 h inhibited phenylephrine (PE)-induced tension in endothelium-intact, but not -denuded, tissues, whereas E2 inhibited PE-induced contraction in both preparations. The effects of 2-ME and E2 on endothelium-intact preparations were prevented by L-NAME hydrochloride (a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor). The 2-ME treatment reduced PE-induced phosphorylation of the 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain. The inhibitory effects of 2-ME and E2 were not affected by ICI-182780 (an estrogen receptor antagonist) or actinomycin D (a gene transcription inhibitor); however, the effect of 2-ME, but not E2, was prevented by cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor). Furthermore, the effect of E2 was not blocked by 1-aminobenzotriazole (a cytochrome P-450 inhibitor) or Ro 41-0960 (a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor). The effect of 2-ME was not mimicked by microtubule-interfering agents (nocodazole or Taxol). We conclude that 2-ME inhibits smooth muscle contractility through an endothelium- and nitric oxide-dependent mechanism, which does not involve estrogen receptors or microtubule disruption. The effect of 2-ME, but not E2, involves de novo protein synthesis. 2-ME does not mediate the inhibitory effect of E2 on smooth muscle contraction. These results support a potentially important role of 2-ME in the regulation of smooth muscle tone in the vasculature.",
