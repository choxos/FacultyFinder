  "title": "Preventing and managing bleeding complications in anticoagulated patients: a case based approach.",
  "abstract": "Bleeding is the most common complication of anticoagulant therapy. Despite the frequency of its occurrence, little evidence is available to guide the care of anticoagulated patients with, or at high risk of, bleeding. This article attempts, using a case based format, to describe common clinical scenarios encountered by clinicians who manage anticoagulated patients and who are bleeding. The paper is \"case based\" and narrative since there is little evidence to guide practice in this area.",
