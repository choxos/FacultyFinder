  "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Current classification systems for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) based on bowel habit do not consider psychological impact. We validated a classification model in a UK population with confirmed IBS, using latent class analysis, incorporating psychological factors. We applied this model in the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiological Survey (RFGES), assessing impact of IBS on the individual and the health care system, and examining reproducibility. METHODS: We applied our model to 2195 individuals in the RFGES with Rome IV-defined IBS. As described previously, we identified 7 clusters, based on gastrointestinal symptom severity and psychological burden. We assessed demographics, health care-seeking, symptom severity, and quality of life in each. We also used the RFGES to derive a new model, examining whether the broader concepts of our original model were replicated, in terms of breakdown and characteristics of identified clusters. RESULTS: All 7 clusters were identified. Those in clusters with highest psychological burden, and particularly cluster 6 with high overall gastrointestinal symptom severity, were more often female, exhibited higher levels of health care-seeking, were more likely to have undergone previous abdominal surgeries, and had higher symptom severity and lower quality of life (P < .001 for trend for all). When deriving a new model, the best solution consisted of 10 clusters, although at least 2 seemed to be duplicates, and almost all mapped on to the previous clusters. CONCLUSIONS: Even in the community, our original clusters derived from patients with physician-confirmed IBS identified groups of individuals with significantly higher rates of health care-seeking and abdominal surgery, more severe symptoms, and impairments in quality of life.",
