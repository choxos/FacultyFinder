  "title": "An introduction to systematic reviews and meta-analysis: a workshop report on promoting evidence based medical practice through capacity building in research synthesis.",
  "abstract": "The increasing urgency for evidence based practice, especially in resource limited settings has inspired many initiatives to this effect. In Africa there is limited skill in research synthesis and the production of systematic reviews. The Centre for the Development of Best Practices in Health, together with the South African Cochrane Centre organised a workshop to train Cameroonian researchers on how to initiate and complete systematic reviews. Five facilitators and fifteen participants met over a period of four days. At the end of the workshop the participants expressed high levels of satisfaction and motivation to conduct systematic reviews, but expressed the need for additional support. Facilitators of future systematic review courses should address challenges related to internet access, adult education and realistic expectations from the participants.",
