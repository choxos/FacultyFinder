  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact and effectiveness of an experiential interprofessional education workshop on noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the setting of a neonatal intensive care unit. METHODS: In the present cross-sectional study, a full-day workshop, consisting of didactic and hands-on components, was developed to assess knowledge and perceptions, and to disseminate the latest evidence and practical aspects of NIV use. All health care professionals (HCPs) were asked to participate. Pre- and post-participation questionnaires and knowledge tests were used to assess the effectiveness of knowledge transfer, and to seek participants' reflections on the utility of the workshop. RESULTS: Among 214 participants, 206 (96%) and 195 (91%) completed the pre- and post-participation questionnaires, respectively. The majority agreed (14%) or strongly agreed (75%) that NIV education was important for their role. Participants scored their perceived comfort with NIV following the workshop highly (median 5 [interquartile range (IQR) 1]) on a five-point Likert scale and 96% would recommend it to a colleague. Median knowledge scores on NIV, assessed as percent correct responses, increased from 74% (IQR 16) to 86% (IQR 11) (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A focused, context-specific workshop helped improve understanding and comfort among HCPs while reducing misconceptions about NIV. Further research to assess optimal delivery of NIV education and impact on patient outcomes is required.",
