  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Type-2 diabetes (T2D) is a complex chronic condition associated with a lower quality of life due to disease specific distress. While there is growing support for personalized diabetes programs, care for mental health challenges is often fragmented and limited by access to psychiatry, and integration of care. The use of communication technology to improve team based collaborative care to bridge these gaps is promising but untested. METHODS: We conducted an explanatory sequential mixed methods study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the co-designed Technology-Enabled Collaborative Care for Diabetes and Mental Health (TECC-D) program. Participants included adults aged â‰¥18 years who had a clinical diagnosis of T2D, and self-reported mental health concerns. RESULTS: 31 participants completed the 8-week virtual TECC-D program. Findings indicate that the program is feasible and acceptable and indicate that there is a role for virtual diabetes and mental health care. DISCUSSION: The TECC-D program, designed through an iterative co-design process and supported by innovative, responsive adaptations led to good uptake and satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The TECC-D model is a feasible and scalable care solution that empowers individuals living with T2D and mental health concerns to take an active role in their care.",
