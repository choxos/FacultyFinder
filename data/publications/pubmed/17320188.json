  "title": "Non-contact micro-cantilevers detect photothermally induced vibrations that can segregate different categories of exfoliative cervical cytology.",
  "abstract": "We implemented a non-contact photo-thermo-mechanical recording method whereby a silicon nitride atomic force microscopy cantilever is placed several micrometer above the surface of samples. Samples were illuminated with infrared (IR) radiation after which, cantilever mechanical vibrations were optically sensed. Following spectrometric acquisition and Fourier transformation, true IR absorption spectra were obtained. With multivariate analysis, segregation between different categories of exfoliative cervical cytology was obtained. This approach points towards the implementation of a novel near-field system that allows IR spectral analysis without probe contamination.",
