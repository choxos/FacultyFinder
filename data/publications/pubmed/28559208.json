  "title": "Novel splice mutation in LRP4 causes severe type of Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome with oro-facial and skeletal symptoms.",
  "abstract": "Cenani-Lenz syndactyly syndrome (CLSS; MIM-212780) is a rare autosomal recessive limb malformation characterized by complete osseous fusion of all fingers and toes, disorganization of phalangeal elements and severe shortening of the radius and ulna. It is occasionally associated with renal hypoplasia, oro-facial defects, scoliosis of the thoracic spine, hearing loss, and genital anomalies. Here we describe a consanguineous Pakistani kindred with a severe form of CLSS characterized by complete syndactyly and disorganization of fingers, oligo-syndactyly of toes, shortening of limbs, frontal bossing, and hypoplasia/agenesis of left kidney. The affected individuals were additionally presented with short stature, cleft-lip and hypoplastic shoulder joint with restricted upper limb movement. A novel splice variant in LRP4 (c.316+1G > A) segregated with the phenotype in a five generations family. The mutation is predicted to add 29 non-native amino acids with a premature termination, resulting in approximately 90% length reduction of the wild-type transcript. These findings not only further expand the phenotypic variability of CLSS but also indicate that early truncated and loss-of-function mutations in LRP4 lead to a more severe CLSS phenotype.",
