  "abstract": "Ascites is the most common decompensation-associated complication of cirrhosis leading to reduced survival. Following significant development of antimicrobial resistance and studies comparing therapeutic options, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases released a new guidance providing an in-depth review of those studies and updated guidelines based on expert opinions and emerging data. We review salient 2021 guidance recommendations to provide brief pearls for diagnosis and management of ascites and relevant conditions associated with decompensated cirrhosis, such as hyponatremia, hepatic hydrothorax, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and hepatorenal syndrome, and use of transjugular intrahepatic shunt.",
