  "title": "Closed-Loop tACS Delivered during Slow-Wave Sleep Reduces Retroactive Interference on a Paired-Associates Learning Task.",
  "abstract": "Previous studies have found a benefit of closed-loop transcranial alternating current stimulation (CL-tACS) matched to ongoing slow-wave oscillations (SWO) during sleep on memory consolidation for words in a paired associates task (PAT). Here, we examined the effects of CL-tACS in a retroactive interference PAT (ri-PAT) paradigm, where additional stimuli were presented to increase interference and reduce memory performance. Thirty-one participants were tested on a PAT before sleep, and CL-tACS was applied over the right and left DLPFC (F3 and F4) vs. mastoids for five cycles after detection of the onset of each discrete event of SWO during sleep. Participants were awoken the following morning, learned a new PAT list, and then were tested on the original list. There was a significant effect of stimulation condition (p = 0.04297; Cohen's d = 0.768), where verum stimulation resulted in reduced retroactive interference compared with sham and a significant interaction of encoding strength and stimulation condition (p = 0.03591). Planned simple effects testing within levels of encoding revealed a significant effect of stimulation only for low-encoders (p = 0.0066; Cohen's d = 1.075) but not high-encoders. We demonstrate here for the first time that CL-tACS during sleep can enhance the protective benefits on retroactive interference in participants who have lower encoding aptitude.",
