  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This study aims to define contemporary trends in characteristics, costs and management of patients diagnosed with oesophageal adenocarcinoma in New Zealand. METHODS: Clinical, pathological and management data of the 135 patients presenting with histologically proven adenocarcinoma to our institution over a 5-year period (January 2010 to December 2014) was collected. Primary analysis reviewed patient demographics, co-morbidities, treatment strategy and survival. Secondary analysis defined operative outcomes including complications, mortality rates and overall survival to December 2016. RESULTS: Thirty-eight patients underwent oesophago-gastrectomy (resection rate 28%) with curative intent following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with Clavien-Dindo â‰¥3 complications in 17 patients (46%). Actuarial survivals from surgery at 1, 3 and 5 years were (79, 55 and 50%), with 19 patients (54%) alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 26.5 months (range 1-82 months). Overall, this represented one sixth of the national volume of oesophagectomy. Ninety-seven patients were managed non-surgically due to metastatic or advanced local disease (n = 64), co-morbid status (n = 27), patients choice (n = 2) and unknown (n = 4). Median survival from diagnosis in non-resected patients was 9 months (range 1-40 months). CONCLUSION: Oesophagectomy remains a challenging procedure for any institution, although good results can be achieved. Foci for referral are emerging in New Zealand for the surgical management of oesophageal cancer.",
