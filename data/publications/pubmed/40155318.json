  "title": "Synthesizing Public Health Preparedness Mechanisms for High-Impact Infectious Disease Threats: A Jurisdictional Scan.",
  "abstract": "AIM: High-impact infectious diseases pose major global health challenges, underscoring the urgent need for robust public health preparedness. Despite efforts to improve global health security, recent pandemics have revealed significant weaknesses in health systems' preparedness and response capabilities. METHODS: We reviewed and synthesized key strategies and lessons from existing public health preparedness plans for high-impact infectious diseases. This included examining national and global plans, focusing on strategic approaches, evidence integration, and real-world implementation lessons. A narrative synthesis, based on the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) model, identified effective practices and areas needing improvement. RESULTS: We screened 1987 documents, selecting 38 for detailed analysis. Findings highlighted strategies for long-term health emergency preparedness, workforce development, enhancing global health frameworks, and investing in infrastructure. Challenges included maintaining laboratory detection, managing sentinel surveillance, and logistical issues. Effective approaches emphasized early threat detection, rapid response, healthcare capacity, medical supply management, and strategic communication. CONCLUSIONS: Effective public health preparedness for high-impact infectious diseases requires a coordinated approach, including early threat detection, rapid response, robust healthcare systems, and strategic communication. Past outbreaks show the need for continuous investment, evidence-based policies, and adaptable health systems. Future research should assess ongoing preparedness efforts and implementation challenges.",
