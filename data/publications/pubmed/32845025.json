  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clinically significant attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are common and impairing in children and youth with autism spectrum disorder(ASD). The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to (a) evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in ASD and (b) distil findings for clinical translation. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and clinical trial registries (1992 onwards). We selected randomized controlled trials conducted in participants <25 years of age, diagnosed with ASD that evaluated ADHD outcomes (hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention) following treatment with stimulants (methylphenidate or amphetamines), atomoxetine, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, bupropion, modafinil, venlafaxine, or a combination, in comparison with placebo, any of the listed medications, or behavioral therapies. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (4 methylphenidate, 4 atomoxetine, 1 guanfacine, 14 antipsychotic, 1 venlafaxine, and 1 tianeptine) were included. Methylphenidate reduced hyperactivity (parent-rated: standardized mean difference [SMD] = -.63, 95%CI = -.95,-.30; teacher-rated: SMD = -.81, 95%CI = -1.43,-.19) and inattention (parent-rated: SMD = -.36, 95%CI = -.64,-.07; teacher-rated: SMD = -.30, 95%CI = -.49,-.11). Atomoxetine reduced inattention (parent-rated: SMD = -.54, 95%CI = -.98,-.09; teacher/investigator-rated: SMD = -0.38, 95%CI = -0.75, -0.01) and parent-rated hyperactivity (parent-rated: SMD = -.49, 95%CI = -.76,-.23; teacher-rated: SMD = -.43, 95%CI = -.92, .06). Indirect evidence for significant reductions in hyperactivity with second-generation antipsychotics was also found. Quality of evidence for all interventions was low/very low. Methylphenidate was associated with a nonsignificant elevated risk of dropout due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Direct pooled evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of methylphenidate or atomoxetine for treatment of ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD. The current review highlights the efficacy of standard ADHD pharmacotherapy for treatment of ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD. Consideration of the benefits weighed against the limitations of safety/efficacy data and lack of data evaluating long-term continuation is undertaken to help guide clinical decision-making regarding treatment of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD.",
