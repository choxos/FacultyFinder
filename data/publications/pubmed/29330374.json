  "title": "Predicting Fibrosis Progression in Renal Transplant Recipients Using Laser-Based Infrared Spectroscopic Imaging.",
  "abstract": "Renal transplants have not seen a significant improvement in their 10-year graft life. Chronic damage accumulation often leads to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IF/TA) and thus graft function loss over time. For this reason, IF/TA has been the chief suspect for a potential prognostic marker for long term outcomes. In this study, we have used infrared spectroscopic (IR) imaging to interrogate the biochemistry of regions of fibrosis from renal transplant biopsies to identify a biochemical signature that can predict rapid progression of fibrosis. IR imaging represents an approach that permits label-free biochemical imaging of human tissues towards identifying novel biomarkers for disease diagnosis or prognosis. Two cohorts were identified as progressors (n = 5, > 50% fibrosis increase between time points) and non-progressors (n = 5, < 5% increase between time points). Each patient had an early time point and late time point biopsy. Collagen associated carbohydrate moieties (ν(C-O), 1035 cm[-1] and ν(C-O-C),1079 cm[-1]) spectral ratios demonstrated good separation between the two cohorts (p = 0.001). This was true for late and early time point biopsies suggesting the regions of fibrosis are biochemically altered in cases undergoing progressive fibrosis. Thus, IR imaging can potentially predict rapid progression of fibrosis using histologically normal early time point biopsies.",
