  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of disorders of the gut-brain interaction (DGBI) among people with obesity in the general population is unknown. Our aim was to assess the prevalence of DGBI among obese subjects in the general population in comparison with normal or overweight subjects, as well as exploring factors associated with DGBI in obesity in Europe. METHODS: We included subjects who completed the internet-based survey of the Rome Foundation Global Epidemiology study in 11 European countries. Obesity was defined as a BMI>30 kg/m[2] and participants were divided into three classes: 1: BMI 30 to <35 kg/m[2], 2: BMI 35 to <40 kg/m[2], and 3: BMI 40 kg/m[2] or higher. The prevalence of symptoms compatible with DGBI was reported and compared between obese and normal or overweight (BMI between 18.5 and <30 kg/m[2]) participants. Factors potentially associated with DGBI and obesity including demographics, psychological distress (PHQ-4), non-GI somatic symptoms (PHQ-12), quality of life (PROMIS-10), healthcare access, medication and food consumption were assessed. RESULTS: We included 20,117 participants in our analysis. The prevalence of obesity was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.4), with 12.6%, 3.7% and 1.6% in obesity classes 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The prevalence of any DGBI was 44.2% in the obese group versus 39.6% in the normal or overweight group (OR = 1.20 (1.12, 1.30)), with all DGBI being more prevalent in the obese versus normal or overweight group, with the exception for functional constipation where the opposite pattern was seen. Female sex, higher level of psychological distress and more severe non-GI somatic symptoms were seen in the group with DGBI associated with obesity. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms compatible with DGBI are common among European people with obesity in the general population and are linked with certain demographic and disease-related factors. This should be acknowledged in the management of patients with obesity.",
