  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for determinants of physical activity in older adults. INTRODUCTION: Physical activity is an important predictor of multi-morbidity, falls, and cognitive decline in older adulthood. Understanding what influences older adults' physical activity behavior is an important first step for guiding effective interventions for promoting physical activity in this population. INCLUSION CRITERIA: This umbrella review will include systematic reviews (including scoping reviews) reporting on the relationship between determinants (also referred to as correlates or factors), measured by either self-report or direct measurement, and physical activity in adults ≥60 years. METHODS: A systematic search of six databases will be completed in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and AgeLine. Two independent reviewers will screen titles, abstracts, and full-text articles, and perform data extraction and quality assessment. Evidence for determinants of physical activity will be synthesized using the socio-ecological model. If possible, evidence will be compared by study design, type of physical activity, outcome measure used, setting, and sex. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020159332.",
