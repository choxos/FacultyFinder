  "title": "Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Association of Interventional Cardiology/Canadian Society of Cardiac Surgery position statement on revascularization--multivessel coronary artery disease.",
  "abstract": "This position statement addresses issues in revascularization for multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) from the perspective of both cardiologists and cardiac surgeons. Recommendations are made based on evidence from clinical trials and observational studies, with an emphasis on the increasing number of individuals with significant comorbid disease burden and functional debilitation who are being referred for definitive management of their multivessel CAD in the context of routine clinical practice. These types of individuals have traditionally not been included in the many clinical trials that have been the basis for guidelines and recommendations, and the objective of the proposed medical intervention or revascularization (or both) would not necessarily be to improve prognosis but to improve quality of life. One purpose of this document is to propose practical multidisciplinary approaches to the management of these patients. Recommendations are made for revascularization in acute coronary syndromes and stable CAD, with specific considerations for individuals with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure, chronic renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We also consider the use of various risk scores, including the Society of Thoracic Surgeons score, the EuroSCORE, and the SYNTAX II score. The importance of a heart team approach is also emphasized. The complementary role of coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention is highlighted, along with the importance of optimal medical therapy.",
