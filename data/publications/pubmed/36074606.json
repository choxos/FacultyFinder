  "title": "Mutant Samd9l expression impairs hematopoiesis and induces bone marrow failure in mice.",
  "abstract": "SAMD9 and SAMD9L germline mutations have recently emerged as a new class of predispositions to pediatric myeloid neoplasms. Patients commonly have impaired hematopoiesis, hypocellular marrows, and a greater risk of developing clonal chromosome 7 deletions leading to MDS and AML. We recently demonstrated that expressing SAMD9 or SAMD9L mutations in hematopoietic cells suppresses their proliferation and induces cell death. Here, we generated a mouse model that conditionally expresses mutant Samd9l to assess the in vivo impact on hematopoiesis. Using a range of in vivo and ex vivo assays, we showed that cells with heterozygous Samd9l mutations have impaired stemness relative to wild-type counterparts, which was exacerbated by inflammatory stimuli, and ultimately led to bone marrow hypocellularity. Genomic and phenotypic analyses recapitulated many of the hematopoietic cellular phenotypes observed in patients with SAMD9 or SAMD9L mutations, including lymphopenia, and pinpointed TGF-Î² as a potential targetable pathway. Further, we observed nonrandom genetic deletion of the mutant Samd9l locus on mouse chromosome 6, mimicking chromosome 7 deletions observed in patients. Collectively, our study has enhanced our understanding of mutant Samd9l hematopoietic phenotypes, emphasized the synergistic role of inflammation in exaggerating the associated hematopoietic defects, and provided insights into potential therapeutic options for patients.",
