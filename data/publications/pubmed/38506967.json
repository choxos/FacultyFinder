  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Haemophilia A negatively affects a patient's quality of life. There is a limited amount of health utility data (a measure of health-related quality of life) available for patients with haemophilia A. This information is crucial for cost-effectiveness analysis for haemophilia A treatment. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this project is to elicit the health utilities and factors impacting utility values for haemophilia A patients in Canada. METHODS: This is a population-based, cross-sectional, retrospective study of health utilities in patients with haemophilia A using Patient Report Outcomes Burdens and Experiences (PROBE) components from the Canadian Bleeding Disorders Registry (CBDR). A review of the mean utilities for three severity states, defined by clotting factor VIII level, was completed. A multiple linear regression analysis was completed to examine the determinants of health utilities including age, treatment type, chronic pain status, number of limited joints, and bleed rate. RESULTS: The average utility values (and standard deviations) for patients with haemophilia A in Canada are .79(.17), .76(.20), and .77(.19) for patients with severe, moderate, and mild haemophilia. The regression showed chronic pain status and the number of additional comorbidities as major significant factors (p-value < .001) in haemophilia A utility. Haemophilia severity was shown to be a major factor with smaller p-value (p-value < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Haemophilia A patients have lower utility than the general population. Chronic pain was shown to be a significant, major factor in health-related quality of life. Our study is essential for valuing health outcomes in haemophilia A-related cost-effectiveness analysis.",
