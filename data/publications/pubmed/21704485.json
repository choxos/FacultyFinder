  "title": "Assessing short-term functional outcomes and knee alignment of computer-assisted navigated total knee arthroplasty.",
  "abstract": "This retrospective study examined the relationship between the mechanical axis of the knee throughout its functional arc and functional outcomes in patients with computer-assisted navigation total knee arthroplasty. Data on final intraoperative functional arc alignment were obtained on 76 patients who had computer-assisted navigation total knee arthroplasty over a 2-year period and correlated with scores from postoperative Short Form 12 and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities functional outcome surveys. No correlation was found between functional arc alignment and outcomes from Western Ontario and McMaster Universities or Short Form 12 surveys; however, subgroup analysis of patients with more than 3° average final intraoperative alignment throughout the functional arc of motion demonstrated increased difficulty with daily activities (P = .05). The results indicate that patients with more than 3° average alignment throughout the functional arc of motion perform more poorly with daily activities postoperatively.",
