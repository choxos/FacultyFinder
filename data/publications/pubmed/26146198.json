  "title": "Long Term Outcomes Following Freestyle Stentless Aortic Bioprosthesis Implantation: An Australian Experience.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The Freestyle stentless bioprosthesis (FSB) has been demonstrated to be a durable prosthesis in the aortic position. We present data following Freestyle implantation for up to 10 years post-operatively and compare this with previously published results. METHODS: A retrospective cohort analysis of 237 patients following FSB implantation occurred at five Australian hospitals. Follow-up data included clinical and echocardiographic outcomes. RESULTS: The cohort was 81.4% male with age 63.2±13.0 years and was followed for a mean of 2.4±2.3 years (range 0-10.9 years, total 569 patient-years). The FSB was implanted as a full aortic root replacement in 87.8% patients. The 30-day all cause mortality was 4.2% (2.0% for elective surgery). Cumulative survival at one, five and 10 years was 91.7±1.9%, 82.8±3.8% and 56.5±10.5%, respectively. Freedom from re-intervention at one, five and 10 years was 99.5±0.5%, 91.6±3.7% and 72.3±10.5%, respectively. At latest echocardiographic review (mean 2.3±2.1 years post-operatively), 92.6% had trivial or no aortic regurgitation. Predictors of post-operative mortality included active endocarditis, acute aortic dissection and peripheral vascular disease. CONCLUSIONS: We report acceptable short and long term outcomes following FSB implantation in a cohort of comparatively younger patients with thoracic aortic disease. The durability of this bioprosthesis in the younger population remains to be confirmed.",
