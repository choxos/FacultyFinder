  "title": "Controversies in Allergy: Aspirin Desensitization or Biologics for Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease-How to Choose.",
  "abstract": "Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) can be a frustratingly complex syndrome to treat. Until recently, standard medical and surgical therapies for patients' asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis were the primary treatment modalities available, combined with either complete avoidance of all aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, or aspirin desensitization and initiation of high-dose aspirin therapy. There are now several targeted respiratory biologics added to the available armament for patients with AERD and choosing between this ever-growing list of options can be daunting for both patients and their clinicians. This review includes our understanding and interpretation of the existing data for each option, along with our own approach to weighing the pros and cons of each treatment for individual patients.",
