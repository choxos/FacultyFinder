  "abstract": "A 45-year-old woman with a history of uterine fibroids and abnormal uterine bleeding presents to the emergency department (ED) with presyncope and weakness. A gynecology consultation for definitive management was requested. The complete blood count demonstrates a hemoglobin (Hb) of 6.5 g/dL and a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 65 fL. What is the role of IV iron in managing iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) presenting to the ED/urgent care?",
