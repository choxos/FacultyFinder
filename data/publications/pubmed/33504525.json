  "abstract": "Upside-down reversal of vision (UDRV) is a rare form of metamorphopsia, or visual illusions that can distort the size, shape or inclination of objects. This phenomenon is paroxysmal and transient in nature, with patients reporting a sudden inversion of vision in the coronal plane, which typically remains for seconds or minutes, though occasionally persists for hours or days, before returning to normal. Distorted egocentric orientation (ie, the patient perceives the body to be tilted away from the vertical plane) is even more rare as a co-occurring phenomenon. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a veteran who presented with UDRV and distorted egocentric orientation during hospitalisation on an inpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation setting following an elective hip surgery. This case serves not only to document the presence of rare visual illusions, but also illustrates the importance and value of an interdisciplinary team approach.",
