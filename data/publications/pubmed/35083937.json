  "abstract": "Telemedicine modalities for patient care have seen significant global uptake during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to bibliometrically evaluate the evolution and current landscape of telemedicine literature in Canada. The Scopus database was searched to identify telemedicine publications for which the first or last author had a Canadian institutional affiliation. Study selection and data abstraction were conducted by two pairs of independent reviewers. Between 1976 and January 2021, 810 of 3,620 retrieved citations were telemedicine publications originating from Canada, including 29 randomized controlled trials and 6 systematic reviews. The annual publication output increased substantially from 1/year in 1976 to 80/year in 2020. Based on author keyword analysis, the most frequently investigated disciplines or disease entities were primary care, COVID-19, telepsychiatry, heart failure, and mental health. The insights this study provides will aid scientists, policy makers, and other stakeholders in identifying opportunities for future investigation and clinical application.",
