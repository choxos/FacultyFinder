  "title": "Gout and Excess Risk of Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection Among Vaccinated Individuals: A General Population Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Gout patients often have multiple comorbidities, making them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and poor outcomes. This study was undertaken to examine the association between gout and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes, especially in patients who have received a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. METHODS: We conducted 2 cohort studies using The Health Improvement Network in the UK. Individuals with gout and those without gout from the general population were followed up from December 8, 2020 to October 31, 2021. We estimated the rate difference (RD) and hazard ratio (HR) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes (i.e., hospitalization and death within 30â€‰days after SARS-CoV-2 infection) for individuals with gout versus those without gout using a Cox proportional hazards model according to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination status. We adjusted for potential confounders by using overlap weighting of exposure scores. RESULTS: Among the vaccinated cohort, 1,955 cases of breakthrough COVID-19 infection occurred in 54,576 individuals with gout (4.68 cases per 1,000 person-months), and 52,468 cases occurred in 1,336,377 individuals without gout (3.76 cases per 1,000 person-months). The partially adjusted RD of breakthrough infection was 0.91 cases per 1,000 person-months (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.62-1.20 cases per 1,000 person-months), and the partially adjusted HR was 1.24 (95% CI 1.19-1.30). Gout was also associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.30 [95% CI 1.10-1.53]) and death (adjusted HR 1.36 [95% CI 0.87-2.13]). Women with gout had an increased risk of hospitalization (adjusted HR 1.55 [95% CI 1.15-2.10]) and death (adjusted HR 2.46 [95% CI 1.12-5.41]). Similar associations with gout were observed in the unvaccinated cohort. CONCLUSION: These general population data suggest that individuals with gout, especially women, have higher risks of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes, even when vaccinated.",
