  "abstract": "This paper describes the use of silk protein, including fibroin and sericin, from an alkaline solution of Ca(OH)2 for the clean degumming of silk, which is neutralized by sulfuric acid to create calcium salt precipitation. The whole sericin (WS) can not only be recycled, but completely degummed silk fibroin (SF) is also obtained in this process. The inner layers of sericin (ILS) were also prepared from the degummed silk in boiling water by 120 °C water treatment. When the three silk proteins (SPs) were individually grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), three grafted silk proteins (G-SF, G-WS, G-ILS) were obtained. After adding I2959 (a photoinitiator), the SP bioinks were prepared with phosphate buffer (PBS) and subsequently bioprinted into various SP scaffolds with a 3D network structure. The compressive strength of the SF/ILS (20%) scaffold added to G-ILS was 45% higher than that of the SF scaffold alone. The thermal decomposition temperatures of the SF/WS (10%) and SF/ILS (20%) scaffolds, mainly composed of a β-sheet structures, were 3 °C and 2 °C higher than that of the SF scaffold alone, respectively. The swelling properties and resistance to protease hydrolysis of the SP scaffolds containing sericin were improved. The bovine insulin release rates reached 61% and 56% after 5 days. The L929 cells adhered, stretched, and proliferated well on the SP composite scaffold. Thus, the SP bioinks obtained could be used to print different types of SP composite scaffolds adapted to a variety of applications, including cells, drugs, tissues, etc. The techniques described here provide potential new applications for the recycling and utilization of sericin, which is a waste product of silk processing.",
