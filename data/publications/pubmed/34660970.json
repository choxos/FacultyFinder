  "title": "Fustin Ameliorates Elevated Levels of Leptin, Adiponectin, Serum TNF-α, and Intracellular Oxidative Free Radicals in High-Fat Diet and Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.",
  "abstract": "Fustin is a prominent ingredient of Rhus verniciflua Stokes (Anacardiaceae) and has a wide range of pharmacological and clinical effects. The present study attempted to evaluate the antidiabetic potential of fustin in streptozotocin- and high-fat diet-induced diabetes in rats. The efficacy of fustin 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg/day p.o. was studied in 60% of total calories from fat as a high-fat diet along with single-dose administration streptozotocin (50 mg/kg, i.p.) experimentally induced diabetes in rats for 42 days. The mean body weight; blood glucose; and biochemical parameters such as lipid profile, total protein (TP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), malondialdehyde (MDA), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), insulin, leptin levels, adiponectin levels, glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity in serum were measured. The rats' weight was maintained in the fustin groups compared to the diabetic control group. Diabetes caused a significant increase in serum levels in blood glucose, lipid profile, MDA, TNF-α, ALT, and AST parameters and a decrease in serum insulin, adiponectin, leptin, GSH, SOD, and CAT compared to healthy rats. The treatment regimen with fustin (50 and 100 mg/kg) significantly restored all serum parameters in test groups. The present study found clinical evidence for the first time regarding the significant antidiabetic property of fustin, which could be a worthwhile candidate for the treatment of diabetes.",
