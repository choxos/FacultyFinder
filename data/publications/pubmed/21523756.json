  "title": "Outcomes and metrics: measuring the impact of a comprehensive adolescent and young adult cancer program.",
  "abstract": "Against a background of poorly coordinated provision of holistic care to the adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer population, the Canadian National Task Force on Adolescent and Young Adult Oncology, which is supported by the Canadian Partnership Against Cancer and the C17 network, convened a workshop to formulate the components of a systematic approach to care for this age group. Because such a program will deflect scarce resources, it must be validated and justified by reproducible metrics. A subgroup of experts was convened, comprising attendees at the AYA workshop, including AYA cancer survivors. A substantial number of key, feasible, and consistent metrics were identified and are systematized, justified, and presented in this article. Prioritization from within this range will be necessary.",
