  "title": "Facedown Positioning in Macular Hole Surgery: A Systematic Review and Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "TOPIC: To assess the anatomic and visual effects of facedown positioning (FDP) advice in patients undergoing vitrectomy with gas tamponade for idiopathic full-thickness macular holes (FTMHs) and to explore differential treatment effects by macular hole size and FDP duration. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The necessity and duration of FDP for FTMH closure remain contentious, with no consensus guidelines. METHODS: Prospectively registered systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing FDP with no FDP (nFDP) across the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases and clinical trial registries from January 2000 to March 2023 (CRD42023395152). All adults with idiopathic FTMHs undergoing vitrectomy with gas tamponade were included. The main outcomes were primary macular hole closure and postoperative visual acuity at 6 months or nearest time point. RESULTS: Of 8 eligible trials, 5 contributed IPD for 379 eyes and were included in our analysis. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) for primary closure with FDP versus nFDP was 2.41 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.98-5.93, P = 0.06; low-certainty evidence), translating to a risk ratio (RR) of 1.08 (1.00-1.11) and a number needed to treat (NNT) of 15. The FDP group exhibited a mean improvement in postoperative visual acuity of -0.08 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (-0.13 to -0.02, P = 0.006; low-certainty evidence) compared with the nFDP group. Benefits were more certain in participants with larger holes of minimum linear diameter ≥ 400 μm: adjusted OR for closure ranged from 1.13 to 10.12 (P = 0.030) (NNT 12), with a mean visual acuity improvement of -0.18 to -0.01 logMAR (P = 0.022). Each additional day of FDP was associated with improved odds of anatomic success (adjusted OR, 1.02-1.41, RR, 1.00-1.02, P = 0.026) and visual acuity improvement (-0.02 logMAR, -0.03 to -0.01, P = 0.002), possibly plateauing at 3 days. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides low-certainty evidence that FDP improves the anatomic and visual outcomes of macular hole surgery modestly and indicates that the effect may be more substantial for macular holes exceeding 400 μm. The findings support recommending FDP for patients with macular holes exceeding 400 μm pending further investigation.
