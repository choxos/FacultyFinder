  "title": "Impact of access site choice on outcomes of patients with cardiogenic shock undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The benefit of transradial access (TRA) in patients with cardiogenic shock (CS) is uncertain. We sought to determine the benefits of TRA in patients with CS undergoing coronary angiography/intervention. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central, and electronic databases were searched for studies that assessed the following: (1) patients with CS who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and (2) the association between choice of arterial access, 30-day all-cause mortality, and 30-day major adverse cardiac and cerebral events (MACCEs) using random-effects model. RESULTS: From 3,652 retrieved citations, 8 studies involving 8,131 patients with CS undergoing PCI (via TRA: 2,321 patients, via TFA: 5,810 patients) were included. Transradial access was associated with significantly reduced risk for all-cause mortality (unadjusted: risk ratio [RR] 0.60, 95% CI 0.52-0.71, P < .001, I(2) = 29%, 8 included studies; adjusted: RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.46-0.65, P < .001, I(2) = 0%, 6 included studies) and MACCE (unadjusted: RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.63-0.73, P < .001, I(2) = 0%, 6 included studies; adjusted: RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.52-0.75, P < .001, I(2) = 0%, 4 included studies) at 30 days when compared with TFA. CONCLUSIONS: Transradial access is associated with reduced mortality and MACCE at 30 days in patients with CS undergoing PCI. Considering the possible influence of selection bias on the effect estimate in our analysis, randomized controlled trials are needed to better assess this association.",
