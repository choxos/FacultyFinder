  "abstract": "Lack of Factor VIII (FVIII) concentrates is one of limiting factors for Hemophilia A prophylaxis in resource-limited countries. Rondaptivon pegol (BT200) is a pegylated aptamer and has been shown to elevate the level of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and FVIII in previous studies. A population pharmacokinetic model for BT200 was built and linked to the kinetic models of VWF and FVIII based on reasonable assumptions. The developed PK/PD model for BT200 described the observed kinetic of BT200, VWF, and FVIII in healthy volunteers and patients with mild-to-moderate hemophilia A from two clinical trials. The developed model was evaluated using an external dataset in patients with severe hemophilia A taking recombinant FVIII products. The developed and evaluated PK/PD model was able to describe and predict concentration-time profiles of BT200, VWF, and FVIII in healthy volunteers and patients with hemophilia A. Concentration-time profiles of FVIII were then predicted following coadministration of plasma-derived FVIII concentrate and BT200 under various dosing scenarios in virtual patients with severe hemophilia A. Plasma-derived products, that contain VWF, are more accessible in low-resource countries as compared to their recombinant counterparts. The predicted time above 1 and 3 IU/dL FVIII in one week was compared between scenarios in the absence and presence of BT200. A combination dose of 6 mg BT200 once weekly plus 10 IU/kg plasma-derived FVIII twice weekly maintained similar coverage to a 30 IU/kg FVIII thrice weekly dose in absence of BT200, representing only 22% of the FVIII dose per week.",
