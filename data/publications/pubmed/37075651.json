  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate patient and clinician preferences regarding a preoperative educational program for patients undergoing shoulder replacement surgery. METHODS: This study used a cross-sectional survey of patients awaiting shoulder replacement surgery and clinicians. The survey was comprised of 41 questions for patients and clinicians, regarding preferences for receiving information, content preferences and device preferences. Descriptive statistics were reported for survey questions. RESULTS: 180 patients and 175 clinicians completed the survey. Patients and clinicians' top choices for ways to receive information were: in-person, website and booklets, with use of CD/DVD being extremely unlikely. Patients and clinicians had different preferences regarding content choices. Patients rated the following content topics as important to include in a program: including other patient's previous experiences with this surgery (83 % patients; 40 % clinicians), information for caregivers (84 % patients; 65 % clinicians), expectations for hospital stay (89 % patients; 57 % clinicians), process of anesthesia (87 % patients; 51 % clinicians), and how the surgery is performed (94 % patients; 60 % clinicians). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and patients have differing priorities and perspectives on the content and delivery of preoperative education programs, however, therapeutic goals and accessibility should be considered when designing programs. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Creating education programs should include the lens of both clinicians and patients.",
