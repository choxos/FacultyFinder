  "title": "Completion of the human papillomavirus vaccine series in females attending an urban immunization clinic.",
  "abstract": "This project characterized the extent to which women and girls who initiated human papillomavirus vaccination between 2007 and 2009 at the Baltimore City Health Department completed the full vaccine series, and reasons for failure to follow-up. More than 85% of girls and women had an incomplete series, and it was not possible to reach 80% of these girls and women using the phone number provided. Those who were contacted reported not knowing they needed further doses, having forgotten, being too busy, and/or finding the times and locations of the clinics inconvenient.",
