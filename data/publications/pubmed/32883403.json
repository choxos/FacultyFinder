  "abstract": "Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, discussions about the capabilities of health and social systems to control and contain infectious diseases have been reignited. In Resilient Managed Competition During Pandemics: Lessons from the Italian Experience, Costa-Font, Turatti and Levaggi ask whether or not institutional differences between the managed competition (MC) systems in three of Italy's regions may have affected their performance - and hence, population health outcomes - during the pandemic. Fuchs (2000) previously argued that institutional arrangements not only 'matter', but also sometimes 'matter a great deal' (p. 149, emphasis in original) and this may be particularly true in emergencies.",
