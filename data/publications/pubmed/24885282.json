  "title": "Sleep duration, snoring habits and risk of acute myocardial infarction in China population: results of the INTERHEART study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Less sleep time and snoring have been associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Western populations; however, few studies have evaluated the different aspects of sleep duration and snoring frequency in relation to CVD, and this association has not been examined in China. The present study aimed to address the relation between sleep duration, snoring frequency and risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in China population. METHODS: We conducted a hospital-based case-control study. Cases were first AMI (n = 2909). Controls were matched to cases on age and sex. 2947 controls who did not report previous angina or physical disability completed a questionnaire on sleep duration and snoring frequency. We used logistic regression to control for other risk factors. RESULTS: We observed an inverse association between serious snoring frequency and AMI risk. After adjustment for all the risk factors, and the OR for everyday group and 3-5 times per week group was 1.45 (95% CI: 1.01 to 1.91) and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.52-2.46) compared to no snoring group. The OR for serious level group and moderate group was 1.77 (95% CI: 1.29 to 2.43) and 1.37 (95% CI: 1.10 to 1.69) compared to no snoring group. People having serious snoring increased 77% risk of AMI. 15.2% people in control group have ≤ 6 hours sleeping, compared with 17.4% in AMI group. CONCLUSIONS: Snoring frequency, including as much as everyday and 3-5 times per week, was positively associated with AMI risk and less sleep duration was associated with risk of AMI. Less sleep time could increase AMI risk in China population.",
