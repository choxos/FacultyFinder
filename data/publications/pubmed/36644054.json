  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is growing evidence identifying coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a significant risk factor for thrombosis in inpatients. However, it remains uncertain if patients in the community have been influenced during the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown. This study, across four centres in the United Kingdom (UK), reviewed outpatients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT). AIM: This study aims to find out whether lockdown and COVID-19 led to a change in the characteristics of DVT and patients who are afflicted with it, alongside a review of DVT service. METHODS: Data was collected retrospectively from electronic patient records system for the following periods: April 1 to June 30, 2019, and April 1 to June 30, 2020. These were the key months during the first national lockdown in UK. Data were analysed for patient demographics, risk factors, characteristics of DVT, management, and DVT reoccurrence. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (Dotmatics, Boston, Massachusetts, United States). RESULTS: During the study periods, 227 outpatients from the community sustained DVT in 2019 and 211 in 2020. Of these patients, 13 in 2020 were COVID-19 positive. There was a difference in gender distribution with 128 males and 99 females in 2019, and 93 males and 118 females in 2020 (p= 0.0128). No significant difference was noted in the incidence of thrombophilia with nine in 2019 and three in 2020 (p=0.1437). Fewer long-haul journeys were made in 2020 (only two), compared to 16 in 2019 (p=0.012). Fewer patients had immobility as a risk factor in 2020 (n=55) compared to 2019 (n=79) (p=0.0494). However, there were more patients using oral contraceptive pills, with one in 2019 and nine in 2020 (p=0.0086) . CONCLUSION: There is no significant difference in the characteristics, extent, and management of DVT prior to and during the COVID-19 lockdown. National lockdowns do not affect DVT in the community; however, it is important to highlight the surrounding inpatient numbers.",
