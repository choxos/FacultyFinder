  "title": "Enzyme immobilization on nanomaterials in food industry: current status and future perspectives.",
  "abstract": "Enzymes, as macromolecular biocatalysts, play an essential role in various food processing operations, including juice, baking, brewing, and dairy production. However, their applications are often constrained by poor thermal and pH stability, as well as sensitivity to chemical inhibitors. Enzyme immobilization, as one of the most effective tools in the food industry, offers a solution to these problems. Its principal advantage lies in the ability to shield enzymes from harsh environmental conditions, such as elevated temperatures and extreme pH levels, and it can be readily recovered or recycled compared to its free forms. In addition to the benefits of enzyme immobilization itself, the integration of enzymes with nanotechnology holds great promise for improving the efficiency and specificity of enzyme-based processes in food industry. The use of nanomaterials as carriers for enzymes can increase the surface area available for enzyme-catalyzed reactions, leading to higher yields and faster processing times. Overall, this review highlights the significance of enzyme immobilization and nanotechnology in the food industry and their potential for future advancement. The integration of these technologies can lead to the development of new food products and the improvement of existing processes, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and competitiveness of the food industry.",
