  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of telehealth, which posed unique challenges for the provision of care to older adults who face numerous barriers to accessing and using technology. To improve older adults' online health-related abilities, the UCSF Geriatrics Workforce Enhancement Program (UCSF-GWEP) partnered with Little Brothers Friends of the Elderly-San Francisco (LBFE-SF) to develop a model telehealth training intervention. METHODS: LBFE-SF recruited older adults from their members with wi-fi and paired each one with a new device and volunteer trainer to cover seven lessons and four key tasks (emailing providers, video visits, accessing health information, and using patient portals). Older adults completed surveys to self-assess their skill level after training, and their confidence before, immediately after, and 3 months post training. A subset of trainees were also interviewed about their program goals and experiences. UCSF-GWEP conducted statistical analyses of survey data, and coded interview transcripts to identify aspects of the model supportive to learning and success. RESULTS: Of 43 participants, 31 completed training. Their median age was 75; 48% were non-white; 45% had no more than a high school education; and 63% reported yearly income below U.S. $20,000. Three months after completing the program, more than 50% of trainees reported that they needed little or no help performing all four key tasks, and confidence with video visits, online searches, and patient portals showed significant improvement. Additionally, in interviews participants reported improved health, social benefits, and explained that learning was facilitated by self-pacing, repetition, and longitudinal support from volunteer trainers. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with various barriers to learning technology showed online independence and increased confidence with some telehealth tasks after a novel training intervention. Key characteristics of the model included a tablet device, one-on-one longitudinal support from volunteers, comprehensive learning materials, and community-academic partnership.",
