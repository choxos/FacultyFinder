  "abstract": "Wheat amylase/trypsin inhibitors (ATIs) have gained significant relevance as inducers of intestinal and extra-intestinal inflammation. In this study, we present a novel hybrid data-independent acquisition (DIA) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) approach, combining QconCAT technology with short microflow LC gradients and DIA and apply the method toward the quantitative proteome analysis of ATI extracts. The presented method is fast, robust, and reproducible and provides precise QconCAT-based absolute quantification of major ATI proteins while simultaneously quantifying the proteome by label-free quantification (LFQ). We analyzed extracts of 60 varieties of common wheat grown in replication and evaluated the reproducibility and precision of the workflow for the quantification of ATIs. Applying the method to analyze different wheat species (i.e., common wheat, spelt, durum wheat, emmer, and einkorn) and comparing the results to published data, we validated inter-laboratory and cross-methodology reproducibility of ATI quantification, which is essential in the context of large-scale breeding projects. Additionally, we applied our workflow to assess environmental effects on ATI expression, analyzing ATI content and proteome of same varieties grown at different locations. Finally, we explored the potential of combining QconCAT-based absolute quantification with DIA-based LFQ proteome analysis for the generation of new hypotheses or assay development.",
