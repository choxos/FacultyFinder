  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: To systematically review neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy options for women with newly diagnosed stage II-IV ovarian cancer. METHODS: Phase III trials were searched using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Maintenance therapies were excluded. RESULTS: Thirty-three trials were included. For women with high-risk profiles that would contraindicate upfront cytoreductive surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be an option. In the post-surgical adjuvant setting, the three-weekly regimen consisting of paclitaxel and carboplatin remains the standard of care. Docetaxel may be offered to those who are unable to tolerate paclitaxel. Intraperitoneal cisplatin and paclitaxel increased OS for stage III optimally debulked women (GOG 172). The intraperitoneal regimens in GOG 252 offered no survival benefit and some harms in terms of toxicity and quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence to support adding a third agent to the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel. Results of the iPocc study will clarify the role of intraperitoneal chemotherapy.",
