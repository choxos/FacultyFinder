  "abstract": "BRIEF ABSTRACT: This is a protocol to assess feasibility of conducting a prospective cohort study comparing local flaps versus skin grafts for surgical excision of skin cancer from the face. INTRODUCTION: Skin cancer is the most common malignancy worldwide and the face is one of the most common locations of occurrence. Surgical excision is the most popular treatment for small lesions of the face. Defects can be reconstructed using local flaps or skin grafts. There is a paucity of literature evaluating outcomes after skin cancer surgery from the patient's perspective using valid measurement tools. The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective observational cohort study. The primary outcomes include recruitment rates, eligibility rate, compliance of intervention and rate of completion of the primary outcome (FACE-Q scales) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include examining patient characteristic and FACE-Q score differences between local flaps to skin grafts and adverse events. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a prospective cohort study consisting of an anticipated 30 patients aged ≥18 years. The study population will consist of a consecutive sample of non-melanoma facial skin cancer patients undergoing a skin graft or local flap. Patients will be followed and evaluated with the FACE-Q questionnaire at 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-operation. The following criteria will determine success: patients who meet eligibility criteria >70%; recruitment rate >70%; compliance with intervention >90%; rate of completion of full-scale prospective study primary outcome (FACE-Q at 3 months) >80%; retention rate at 6-month follow-up visit >70%. DISCUSSION: The findings of this study will be used to guide the sample size calculation for a future, large-scale prospective study.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04842279).",
