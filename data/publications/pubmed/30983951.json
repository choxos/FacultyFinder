  "abstract": "Depression is a common and disabling mental disorder characterized by high disability and mortality, but its physiopathology remains unclear. In this study, we combined a non-targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomic approach and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based proteomic analysis to elucidate metabolite and protein alterations in the hippocampus of rat after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS), an extensively used animal model of depression. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) was conducted to integrate underlying relationships among differentially expressed metabolites and proteins. Twenty-five significantly different expressed metabolites and 234 differentially expressed proteins were identified between CSDS and control groups. IPA canonical pathways and network analyses revealed that intracellular second messenger/signal transduction cascades were most significantly altered in the hippocampus of CSDS rats, including cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), phosphoinositol, tyrosine kinase, and arachidonic acid systems. These results provide a better understanding of biological mechanisms underlying depression, and may help identify potential targets for novel antidepressants.",
