  "abstract": "The objective was to compare the impact on treatment satisfaction (TS) and quality of life (QoL) of early insulinization with glargine versus adjusting oral antidiabetic drug (OAD) therapy in people with Type 2 diabetes with uncontrolled glycemia. TS and QoL were assessed at baseline, weeks 12 and 24 within the Canadian INSIGHT, a randomized 24-week trial of Type 2 patients. A total of 366 patients randomized to either the insulin glargine arm (n=182) or the adjusted OAD therapy arm (n=184) completed both questionnaires. At baseline, TS and QoL were similar in both groups. A1c reduction was greater in the insulin glargine arm. TS improved from baseline in both treatment arms; however, there was greater increase with insulin glargine+OAD. Perceived frequency of hypoglycemia and hypoglycemia were lower at week 24, with no differences between the two groups. Perceived frequency of hyperglycemia improved with glargine at week 12, and no difference was found at 24 weeks. Finally, QoL improved in both groups, but significantly more with glargine at both weeks 12 and 24. Improving glucose control by adding insulin glargine to OAD therapy had a positive impact on TS and general QoL without complaints related to hypoglycemia.",
