  "title": "Using Patient-Specific 3D Modeling and Simulations to Optimize Microwave Ablation Therapy for Liver Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Microwave ablation (MWA) of liver tumors presents challenges like under- and over-ablation, potentially leading to inadequate tumor destruction and damage to healthy tissue. This study aims to develop personalized three-dimensional (3D) models to simulate MWA for liver tumors, incorporating patient-specific characteristics. The primary objective is to validate the predicted ablation zones compared to clinical outcomes, offering insights into MWA before therapy to facilitate accurate treatment planning. Contrast-enhanced CT images from three patients were used to create 3D models. The simulations used coupled electromagnetic wave propagation and bioheat transfer to estimate the temperature distribution, predicting tumor destruction and ablation margins. The findings indicate that prolonged ablation does not significantly improve tumor destruction once an adequate margin is achieved, although it increases tissue damage. There was a substantial overlap between the clinical ablation zones and the predicted ablation zones. For patient 1, the Dice score was 0.73, indicating high accuracy, with a sensitivity of 0.72 and a specificity of 0.76. For patient 2, the Dice score was 0.86, with a sensitivity of 0.79 and a specificity of 0.96. For patient 3, the Dice score was 0.8, with a sensitivity of 0.85 and a specificity of 0.74. Patient-specific 3D models demonstrate potential in accurately predicting ablation zones and optimizing MWA treatment strategies.",
