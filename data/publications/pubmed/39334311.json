  "title": "The research activities of Ontario's large community hospitals: an updated scoping review.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Community hospitals provide the majority of patient care in Canada but traditionally do not participate in clinical research. The disconnect between where most patients receive their health care and where health research is conducted leads to decreased study recruitment, reduced generalizability of study results, and inequitable patient access to novel therapies. A scoping review of the research activities of Ontario's large community hospitals (LCHs) between 2013 and 2015 reported an annualized output of 266 publications. In the last decade, efforts have been made to engage more community hospitals in research. In this updated scoping review, we provide a snapshot of the research activities of Ontario's LCHs between 2016 and 2022, describing the number and type of research publications as well as the frequency of collaboration within and between LCHs. METHODS: Three medical databases (PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL) were searched for publications that included at least one author affiliated with one of Ontario's 47 LCHs, and for which the topic was hospital or health related. Screening and extraction occurred concurrently. RESULTS: We identified 3,719 publications from 2016 to 22 with at least one Ontario LCH-affiliated author, representing an annualized output of 531 publications. The most frequent publication type was observational study (n = 1,654; 45%), quality improvement (n = 355; 10%), systematic reviews (n = 352; 9%) and randomized controlled trials (n = 325; 9%). The most common disciplines were outpatient care (n = 1,144; 31%), health systems research (n = 806; 22%), inpatient care (n = 437; 12%) and surgery (n = 403; 11%). LCH-affiliated first authors were identified in 997 (27%) publications, representing 755 unique authors, while LCH-affiliated senior authors were identified in 962 (26%) publications, representing 583 unique authors. Among the 1,565 studies with an LCH-affiliated first or senior author, 574 (37%) included collaborators from the same LCH and 86 (5%) included collaborators from other Ontario LCHs. CONCLUSIONS: Health research by LCH-affiliated clinicians and researchers increased significantly in 2016-2022 relative to 2013-2015. Participation in randomized controlled trials however, remains low, suggesting that further efforts are required to build clinical research infrastructure in LCHs.",
