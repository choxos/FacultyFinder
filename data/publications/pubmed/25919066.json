  "title": "Temperature-dependent and bistable current-voltage measurements in zinc porphyrin molecular junctions.",
  "abstract": "We report bistability in current-voltage curves from di(PEP)PorZn in an electromigrated molecular junction. Bistability was observed at ±0.3 V at 300 K but did not occur at 4 K. No bistability was identified at 300 K for another porphyrin molecule (di(Xyl)PorZn), where the phenyl-ethnyl-phenyl (PEP) side groups were replaced with a flexible p-xylene. Molecular dynamics simulations show that bistability may be due to conformation changes related to the fluctuation of the dihedral angle surrounding the zinc and/or the rotation of the porphyrin central plane of the molecule. Results suggest that other mechanisms may play a role in the current-voltage characteristics observed.",
