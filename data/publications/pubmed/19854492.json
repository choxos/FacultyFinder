  "abstract": "Emerging minimally invasive procedures for the treatment of patients with benign prostatic obstruction may have advantages over transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). We performed a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of randomized trials published upto April 2008 comparing TURP with photoselective vaporization, holmium laser ablation, and bipolar TURP. A total of 38 articles reporting results from 21 trials were included (photoselective vaporization = 3; holmium laser ablation = 1; bipolar TURP = 17). An assessment of perioperative and postoperative outcomes up to 12 months indicates benefits for these procedures. However, long-term follow-up and stronger methodological quality of the evidence is required to assess the long-term durability of the technologies.",
