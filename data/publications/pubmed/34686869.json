  "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines For The Management Of Colorectal Cancer, A Consensus Statement By The Society Of Surgeons® And Surgical Oncology Society Of Pakistan®.",
  "abstract": "A joint effort by the Society of Surgeons Pakistan and Society of Surgical Oncology Pakistan, these guidelines provide a framework for the practicing surgeons involved in care and management of patients with colorectal cancer. The guidelines take into account the issues related to our local circumstances and provide a minimum standard of care that must be given to these patients. The Guideline Committee had members from all disciplines, including surgery, surgical oncology, medical oncology and radiation oncology. The guidelines have attempted to simplify things to understand and follow for the practicing surgeons. With these guidelines we wish to eliminate disparities in treatment among institutions and prevent any under treatment of patients.",
