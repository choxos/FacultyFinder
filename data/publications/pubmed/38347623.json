  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Excessive energy intake in modern society has led to an epidemic surge in metabolic diseases, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, posing profound threats to women's reproductive health. However, the precise impact and underlying pathogenesis of energy excess on female reproduction remain unclear. METHODS: We established an obese and hyperglycemic female mouse model induced by a high-fat and high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, then reproductive phenotypes of these mice were evaluated by examing sexual hormones, estrous cycles, and ovarian morphologies. Transcriptomic and precise metabolomic analyses of the ovaries were performed to compare the molecular and metabolic changes in HFHS mice. Finally, orthogonal partial leastÂ squares discriminant analysis was performed to compare the similarities of traits between HFHS mice and women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). RESULTS: The HFHS mice displayed marked reproductive dysfunctions, including elevated serum testosterone and luteinizing hormone levels, irregular estrous cycles, and impaired folliculogenesis, mimicking the clinical manifestations of women with PCOS. Precise metabolomic overview suggested that HFHS diet disrupted amino acid metabolism in the ovaries of female mice. Additionally, transcriptional profiling revealed pronounced disturbances in ovarian steroid hormone biosynthesis and glucolipid metabolism in HFHS mice. Further multi-omics analyses unveiled prominent aberration in ovarian arginine biosynthesis pathway. Notably, comparisons between HFHS mice and a cohort of PCOS patients identified analogous reproductive and metabolic signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide direct in vivo evidence for the detrimental effects of overnutrition on female reproduction and offer insights into the metabolic underpinnings of PCOS.",
