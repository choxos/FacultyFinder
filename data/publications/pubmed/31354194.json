  "title": "Impact of omega-3 fatty acids on calorie intake and certain anthropometric measurements in children with sickle cell disease in Saudi Arabia.",
  "abstract": "The nutritional status and growth in children with sickle cell disease is compromised due to intake of diet that is low in calories as well as deficient in nutrients. Growth stunting and a low body mass index have been observed in these children. Some children exhibit pica, which is an abnormal eating pattern by ingesting things other than food, like paper, wood etc. This also was found to correlate to lower hemoglobin values. Interventions with certain essential nutrients such as omega-3 fatty acids are known to benefit these children in terms of lowering their complications due to the disease. We therefore wished to see if omega-3 fatty acids exhibit positive effects on their nutritional intake and growth parameters too. Hence, we supplemented these children with omega-3 fatty acids for a period of six months. Both the male and female children with the disease significantly improved their calorific intake as well as body mass index. Also a lowering of pica status was distinctly observed.",
