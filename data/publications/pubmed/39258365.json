  "title": "Stroke Prevention With Prophylactic Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion in Cardiac Surgery Patients Without Atrial Fibrillation: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized and Propensity-Score Studies.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The role of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in patients without previous atrial fibrillation (AF) is not established. This meta-analysis was conducted on patients with normal sinus rhythm who underwent cardiac surgery, with and without concomitant LAAO, to evaluate its effect on the incidence of cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs). METHODS: A systematic review was conducted from inception until December 2023 for randomized and propensity-score studies comparing CVA in patients without AF undergoing cardiac surgery with or without LAAO. RESULTS: Six studies met our inclusion criteria with a total of 4130 patients: 2146 in the LAAO group and 1984 in the no-LAAO group. The risk ratio of postoperative AF was 1.05 (95% CI, 0.86-1.28); P=0.628. The CVA rates at 5 years were 6.8±1.0% in the no-LAAO group and 4.3±0.8% in the LAAO group (log-rank P=0.021). The Cox regression analysis for CVA in patients undergoing LAAO reported a hazard ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.45-0.94); P=0.022. Landmark analysis at 4 years highlighted a significant difference in overall survival between no-LAAO and LAAO groups, 86±12.2% versus 89.6±11.0%; P=0.041. CONCLUSIONS: In this meta-analysis of patients without previous AF undergoing cardiac surgery, LAAO was associated with a decreased risk of CVA, no difference in the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation, and a significant overall survival benefit at a 4-year landmark analysis. Although these findings support LAAO, the randomized LeAAPS trial (Left Atrial Appendage Exclusion for Prophylactic Stroke Reduction Trial), LAA-CLOSURE trial (A Randomized Prospective Multicenter Trial for Stroke Prevention by Prophylactic Surgical Closure of the Left Atrial Appendage in Patients Undergoing Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Surgery), and LAACS-2 trial (Left Atrial Appendage Closure by Surgery-2) will help define the effectiveness of LAAO in patients undergoing cardiac surgery who have risk factors for AF and CVA.
