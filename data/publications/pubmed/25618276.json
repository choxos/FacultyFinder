  "title": "Femoro-acetabular impingement clinical research: is a composite outcome the answer?",
  "abstract": "Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of hip pain in the young adult. However, the methods of evaluating the efficacy of surgical intervention are often not validated and/or inconsistently reported. Important clinical, gait, radiographic and biomarker outcomes are discussed. This article (1) presents the rationale for considering a composite outcome for FAI patients; (2) examines a variety of important end points currently used to evaluate FAI surgery; (3) discusses a strategy to generate a composite outcome by combining these end points; and (4) highlights the challenges and current areas of controversy that such an approach to evaluating symptomatic FAI patients may present.",
