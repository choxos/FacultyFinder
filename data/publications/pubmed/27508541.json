  "title": "Rotavirus Diarrhea in Children Presenting to an Urban Hospital in Western Uttar Pradesh, India.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the proportion and clinical profile of rotavirus associated diarrhea in children aged 6 months to 5 years. METHODS: Clinical details and stool samples were collected from 254 children aged between 6 months to 5 years presenting with acute diarrhea, irrespective of hydration status, to the outpatient department or emergency room of a hospital in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, India. RESULTS: Rotavirus accounted for 26.3% (51 of 194) of diarrhea cases overall, and 41.2% (14 of 34) in hospitalized children. Rotavirus infection was associated with significantly longer duration [3.3 (1.4) d vs. 2.5 (1.1) d; P=0.004) of diarrhea, and more chances of dehydration (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.19, 3.57) as compared to non-rotavirus diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: Rotavirus is a common cause of acute diarrhea in under-five children, and is associated with a longer duration and more chances of dehydration than non-rotavirus diarrhea.",
