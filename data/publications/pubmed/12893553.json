  "abstract": "This study examined students' perceptions of their learning through participation in an interprofessional problem-based course on rehabilitation and HIV. Students representing five health professions participated in an eight-week tutorial course. Qualitative analysis of journals that the students completed throughout the course, and of interviews of the students at completion of the course, revealed that they valued their learning experience. Students gained an appreciation of the roles of others and developed a sense of confidence through justifying their professional role. Through the interprofessional discussions, students were able to increase the breadth and depth of their learning and also gained a rehabilitation perspective. Learning related to HIV and rehabilitation is ideally suited to an interprofessional, problem-based environment.",
