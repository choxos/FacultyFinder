  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The frequent prescribing of psychotropics and high prevalence of polypharmacy among older adults with intellectual disabilities require close monitoring. AIMS: To describe change in prevalence, predictors and health outcomes of psychotropic use during the four waves (2009/2010, 2013/2014, 2016/2017, 2019/2020) of the Intellectual Disability Supplement to the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing (IDS-TILDA). METHOD: Eligible participants were adults (≥40 years) with intellectual disabilities who participated in all four waves of IDS-TILDA and who reported medication use for the entire period. Differences between groups were tested using Cochran's Q test for binary variables and the McNemar-Bowker test for variables with more than two categories. Generalised estimating equation models were used to assess associations between psychotropic use, participants' characteristics and health outcomes. RESULTS: Across waves (433 participants) there were no significant differences in prevalence of psychotropic use (61.2-64.2%) and psychotropic polypharmacy (42.7-38.3%). Antipsychotics were the most used subgroup, without significant change in prevalence between waves (47.6-44.6%). A significant decrease was observed for anxiolytics (26.8-17.6%; P < 0.001) and hypnotics/sedatives (14.1-9.0%; P < 0.05). A significant increase was recorded for antidepressants (28.6-35.8%; P < 0.001) and mood-stabilising agents (11.5-14.6%; P < 0.05). Psychotropic polypharmacy (≥2 psychotropics) was significantly associated with moderate to total dependence in performing activities of daily living over the 10-year period (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.21-2.69; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The study indicates an increase in usage of some classes of psychotropic, a reduction in others and no change in the relatively high rate of antipsychotic use over 10 years in a cohort of older adults with intellectual disabilities and consequent risk of psychotropic polypharmacy and medication-related harm.",
