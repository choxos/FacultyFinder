  "title": "Ectopic Intrathoracic Kidney due to Diaphragmatic Eventration Detected on Bone Scan.",
  "abstract": "The technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate ([99m]Tc-MDP) whole-body bone scan along with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT) can detect challenging soft tissue uptake patterns. We present a case of a 67-year-old female in whom the [99m]Tc-MDP scan, performed 3 hours after injection, revealed abnormal soft tissue uptake in the right thoracic region. No functioning right kidney was seen in the right lumbar region. Hybrid SPECT/CT revealed an ectopic right kidney in the subdiaphragmatic location, accompanied by gut loops and eventration of the right-sided diaphragm. This case underscores the value of SPECT/CT in identifying and characterizing unexpected anatomical abnormalities, such as ectopic kidneys.",
