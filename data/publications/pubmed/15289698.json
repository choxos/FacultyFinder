  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal management for ulnar shaft fractures remains debatable. Investigators have advocated nonoperative management as well as internal fixation of these fractures. OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of this study was to determine the effect of alternative management strategies of fractures of the ulnar shaft on rates of union, infection, and functional outcomes. A secondary objective was to examine outcomes after alternative strategies in managing patients with bone defects.",
