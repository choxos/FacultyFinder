  "title": "Cyclic thrombocytopenia with statistically significant neutrophil oscillations.",
  "abstract": "Cyclic thrombocytopenia is often misdiagnosed as immune thrombocytopenia due to similar clinical features, a fact of significance because cyclic thrombocytopenia generally responds poorly to treatments used successfully in immune thrombocytopenia. A precise diagnosis must establish the statistical significance of periodicity of the platelet counts using statistical methods (eg, Lomb-Scargle periodogram).",
