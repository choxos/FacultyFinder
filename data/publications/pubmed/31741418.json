  "title": "Preadmission Antiplatelet Use and Associated Outcomes and Costs Among ICU Patients With Intracranial Hemorrhage.",
  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Patients with intracranial hemorrhage (including intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic hemorrhage) are commonly admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Although indications for oral antiplatelet agents are increasing, the impact of preadmission use on outcomes in patients with intracranial hemorrhage admitted to the ICU is unknown. We sought to evaluate the association between preadmission oral antiplatelet use, in-hospital mortality, resource utilization, and costs among ICU patients with intracranial hemorrhage. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected registry (2011-2016) and included consecutive adult patients from 2 hospitals admitted to ICU with intracranial hemorrhage. Patients were categorized on the basis of preadmission oral antiplatelet use. We excluded patients with preadmission anticoagulant use. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality and was analyzed using a multivariable logistic regression model. Contributors to total hospital cost were analyzed using a generalized linear model with log link and gamma distribution. RESULTS: Of 720 included patients with intracranial hemorrhage, 107 (14.9%) had been using an oral antiplatelet agent at the time of ICU admission. Oral antiplatelet use was not associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio: 1.31 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-2.22]). Evaluation of total costs also revealed no association with oral antiplatelet use (adjusted ratio of means [aROM]: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.82-1.02, P = .10]). Total cost among patients with intracranial hemorrhage was driven by illness severity (aROM: 1.96 [95% CI: 1.94-1.98], P < .001), increasing ICU length of stay (aROM: 1.05 [95% CI: 1.05-1.06], P < .001), and use of invasive mechanical ventilation (aROM: 1.76 [95% CI: 1.68-1.86], P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Among ICU patients admitted with intracranial hemorrhage, preadmission oral antiplatelet use was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality or hospital costs. These findings have important prognostic implications for clinicians who care for patients with intracranial hemorrhage.",
