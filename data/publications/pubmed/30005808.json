  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Radioguided seed localization (RSL) is an alternative technique to wire-guided localization (WL) for localizing non-palpable breast lesions for breast conserving surgery. The purpose of this study was to assess adoption and outcomes of RSL at 3 academic hospitals in our city. METHODS: Data for consecutive invasive and in-situ breast cancer cases localized with RSL or WL at 3 hospitals between January 2012 and February 2016 were abstracted. Data analysis was conducted using the Student's t-test, ANOVA with Tukey's HSD test for post-hoc multiple comparisons, and chi-squared test. RESULTS: There were 803 consecutive cases. Hospital 1 exclusively used RSL (247 cases), whereas H2 adopted RSL (109 cases), but continued to use WL (347 cases). Hospital 3 exclusively used WL (100 cases). There was no difference between RSL and WL groups in positive margin rate (p = 0.337), re-operation (p = 0.413), or mean specimen volume (p = 0.190). DISCUSSION: There has been variable adoption of RSL in our city. Despite this, relevant surgical outcomes have been similar across groups. The causes of variable adoption of this novel technique merit further investigation.",
