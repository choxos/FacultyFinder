  "title": "Treatment with an antibody to VLA-1 integrin reduces glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring in a rat model of crescentic glomerulonephritis.",
  "abstract": "The alpha 1 beta 1 integrin (VLA-1) is a major collagen/laminin receptor that regulates fibroblast proliferation and mesangial cell migration and cell contraction. We have examined the effect of an antibody to VLA-1 in crescentic glomerulonephritis. Nephrotoxic nephritis was induced in Wistar-Kyoto rats and rats were given monoclonal antibody to VLA-1 (Ha31/8), 2.5 mg/kg, on alternate days. Antibodies were given from day -1 to day 10 or from day 14 to day 28. Treatment from day -1 to day 10, during the early inflammatory phase of nephrotoxic nephritis, had no effect on albuminuria or glomerular crescent formation. In the delayed treatment experiment, all rats developed florid crescentic glomerulonephritis, and control rats showed marked glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring at day 32. VLA-1 expression, by immunohistochemistry, was increased in glomeruli and around tubules. Proteinuria did not differ between groups. In anti-VLA-1-treated rats, serum creatinine was significantly lower at day 32 (P = 0.002) and renal survival was significantly better (P = 0.045). Both glomerular and interstitial scarring were significantly less at day 32 in rats given anti-VLA-1 (P = 0.002). Deposition of ED(A) fibronectin, a marker of new matrix synthesis, and of type IV collagen, were reduced in glomeruli and interstitium in anti-VLA-1-treated animals (P = 0.0006). Expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin, a marker of myofibroblasts, showed no significant difference. Expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was increased in the glomeruli of rats treated with anti-VLA-1. We conclude that VLA-1 mediates both glomerular and interstitial fibrosis in crescentic glomerulonephritis and that neutralization of VLA-1, which enhanced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-9, is a possible therapeutic strategy in progressive renal scarring.",
