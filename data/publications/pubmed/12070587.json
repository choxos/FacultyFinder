  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the use of antiplatelet and lipid lowering therapy among patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery, and to compare their use with that reported among a similar population of patients in Canada. METHODS: Chart review of a cohort of 52 patients undergoing peripheral vascular surgery. The study was carried out at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in May 2000. RESULTS: On discharge, less than 50% of the patients received any antiplatelet or antithrombotic medication. Only 13% of the patients received lipid-lowering therapy. Those findings parallel those of Canadian publications. CONCLUSION: Current literature supports the use of anti platelet and lipid-lowering therapy among patients with peripheral vascular disease. In King Fahad Hopsital, National Guard, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the use of those beneficial interventions is likely sub-optimal. Factors other than randomized clinical trail derived evidence likely influence practice and behavior. Whether dissemination of evidence may change such a pattern of behavior requires further study.",
