  "title": "Method and Atlas to Enable Targeting for Cardiac Radioablation Employing the American Heart Association Segmented Model.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Cardiac radioablation using stereotactic body radiation therapy is gaining popularity as a noninvasive treatment for otherwise refractory ventricular arrhythmias. As radiation oncologists might be unaccustomed to the lexicon used by cardiologists to describe the location of arrhythmogenic foci, a preliminary guide to cardiac-specific anatomy and orientation is needed to foster effective communication between the radiation oncologist and cardiology team. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Electrocardiogram-gated and respiratory-gated computed tomography imaging was acquired per institutional protocol. Additional relevant imaging modalities are described. The American Heart Association 17-segment model is described in detail because this framework is used frequently by cardiologists to describe the location left ventricular abnormalities. RESULTS: A step-by-step guide is provided for properly rotating the heart from standard orthogonal views obtained during radiation simulation to the cardiac-specific orientation needed to appreciate the 17-segment model. Once the proper configuration is achieved, the location of each segment is defined in detail. CONCLUSIONS: This atlas serves as an introduction to the relevant anatomy and principles, and it provides a suggested approach to help delineate cardiac radioablation targets using the established American Heart Association 17-segment model.",
