  "title": "Acupuncture for the Management of Chronic Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.",
  "abstract": "AIM: Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) affects up to half of all patients with diabetes mellitus. Acupuncture is often used to manage chronic pain, but its' effects on DPN are uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture for DPN. METHODS: We searched databases from inception to September 30, 2024. Paired reviewers independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We used random effects models for all meta-analyses and the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence. RESULTS: We included 14 RCTs (1,169 participants, 45% female). Low certainty evidence suggests that, compared to sham, acupuncture may reduce pain (weighted mean difference [WMD] -1.44 cm on a 10 cm VAS, 95%CI -1.72 to -1.15; modelled risk difference [RD] for achieving the minimally important difference [MID] of 1.5 cm: 45%, 95%CI 35-54%). Comparted to sham or usual care, low certainty evidence suggests that acupuncture may reduce overall neurological symptom severity (WMD - 1.22 [95%CI -1.85, -0.59] on the 19-point Toronto Clinical Scoring System [TCSS]), and provide little to no difference in physical functioning, mental functioning, or adverse events. Low certainty evidence suggests that, compared to amitriptyline or pregabalin, acupuncture may reduce pain associated with DPN. CONCLUSIONS: Acupuncture for DPN may reduce pain when compared to sham acupuncture and may reduce neurologic symptom severity and result in little to no difference in physical functioning, mental functioning or adverse events, when compared with sham acupuncture or usual care.",
