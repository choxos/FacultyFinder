  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Developmental stress causing enamel thinning is an important topic in primate biology. Because taxa differ in growth rates and enamel thickness, the goal is to provide a new method allowing direct comparison of prevalence and salience of enamel defects among samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Casts of ape teeth spanning the Late Pleistocene to Late Miocene from three site areas of increasing seasonality, equator (Sumatra) to 20° (Vietnam) and 25°N latitude (China), were examined for enamel defects among paleo-orangutans (n = 571, 222, respectively) and Lufengpithecus lufengensis (n = 198). Frequency of affected teeth and number of linear enamel hypoplasia were recorded. Defect dimensions were measured with a confocal microscope. Simple prevalence is compared to weighted prevalence (%), calculated by dividing \"number of LEH from specific tooth groups\" by \"specific tooth sample size\"; this quantity divided by \"tooth-specific years of imbricational enamel formation.\" Defect dimensions are reduced to a dimensionless index termed \"enamel deficit ratio\" through dividing \"daily enamel deficit\" by \"daily secretion rate.\" RESULTS: Weighted prevalence increases to the North, highlighting latitudinal similarities. In contrast, \"enamel deficit ratio,\" designed to express comparative severity of developmental stress among samples, was least in the high latitude sample and differed little between paleo-orangutan samples. DISCUSSION: The actual numbers generated are not as important as efficacy of the proposed methods for other taxa. Developmental stress appears least severe in the high latitude (Lufengpithecus) sample but affects a greater proportion, compared to paleo-orangutans. Regardless of findings, the proposed solutions to improve comparability of disparate samples, yield reasonable results.",
