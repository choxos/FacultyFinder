  "title": "Starch Janus Particles: Bulk Synthesis, Self-Assembly, Rheology, and Potential Food Applications.",
  "abstract": "Although incredible progress in the field of Janus particles over the last three decades has delivered many promising smart-material prototypes, from cancer-targeting drug delivery vehicles to self-motile nanobots, their real-world applications have been somewhat tempered by concerns over scalability and sustainability. In this study, we adapt a simple, scalable 3D mask method to synthesize Janus particles in bulk using starch as the base material: a natural biopolymer that is safe, biocompatible, biodegradable, cheap, widely available, and versatile. Using this method, starch granules are first embedded on a wax droplet such that half of the starch is covered; then, the uncovered half is treated with octenyl succinic anhydride, after which the wax coating is removed. Janus particles with 49% Janus balance can be produced in this way and were observed to self-assemble into wormlike strings in water due to their hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature. Our Janus starch granules outperform the non-Janus controls as thickening and gelling agents: they exhibit a fourfold increase in water-holding capacity, a 30% lower critical caking concentration, and a viscosity greater by orders of magnitude. They also form gels that are much firmer and more stable. Starch Janus particles with these functional properties can be used as novel, lower-calorie, highly efficient, plant-based super-thickeners in the food industry, potentially reducing starch use in food by 55%.",
