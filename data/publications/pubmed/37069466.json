  "title": "The Data Monitoring Committee: A Collective or a Collection?",
  "abstract": "In this commentary, we urge that a Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) should operate as a collective, that is, as a unitary whole. In so doing, its recommendations should emerge through a consensus development process, not through a vote of the members. The summary notes of its closed session, that is, its minutes, should report the recommendations of the DMC and, if necessary, the justification for those recommendations; it should not attribute opinions to individual members. Importantly, the proceedings of the DMC meetings should not be electronically recorded.",
