  "abstract": "AIMS/INTRODUCTION: To investigate the changes in the gut microbiome in the second trimester of pregnancy associated with later-diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and their relationship with fasting serum levels of metabolites, especially glucose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out a case-control study with 110 GDM patients and 220 healthy pregnant women who provided fecal samples for 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid sequencing in the second trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: Our results showed that GDM patients had lower Î±-diversity that was significantly associated with glycemic traits. Principal coordinates analysis showed significantly different microbial communities, as within GDM patients, seven genera within the phylum Firmicutes and two within the phylum Actinobacteria were significantly decreased, and four genera within phylum Bacteroidetes were increased. In addition, microbiota co-occurrence network analysis was carried out, and decreased genera within the phylum Firmicutes in GDM patients showed a significant negative correlation with oral glucose tolerance test values. Finally, microbial gene functions related to glycan biosynthesis and metabolism were found to be enriched in GDM patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the relationship between changed gut microbiota composition in the second trimester of pregnancy before the diagnosis of GDM and fasting serum levels of metabolites, which might inform the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of GDM.",
