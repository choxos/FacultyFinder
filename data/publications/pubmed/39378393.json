  "title": "OPAR: A Randomized Trial of Partial Breast Irradiation in Five Fractions Once Daily for Early Breast Cancer.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: Previous studies suggest that external-beam partial breast irradiation (PBI) delivered twice a day can lead to increased adverse cosmesis (AC). The objective of our trial was to determine whether two regimens for PBI given once daily over 1 week resulted in acceptable AC to inform a phase III trial. METHODS: Patients age ≥50 years with invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, ≤3 cm in size treated by lumpectomy with negative axillary nodes were randomly assigned to external-beam PBI of 30 Gy or 27.5 Gy, each given in five fractions once daily. The primary outcome was AC (fair or poor) by photographic assessment at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included AC assessed by nurse at 2 years, by patient self-assessment at 3 years, and late toxicity. On the basis of a 17% risk of AC with whole-breast irradiation, the upper bound of a two-sided 90% CI, 23% was set as the tolerance margin (OPAR, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02637024). RESULTS: In total, 142 patients were randomly assigned to 30 Gy and 139 to 27.5 Gy. The median follow-up was 5 years. The mean age was 65 years, and the mean tumor size was 1.2 cm. Both schedules met acceptability criteria by photographic assessment (AC, 12.1% [90% CI, 8.2 to 17.6] for 30 Gy and 15.2% [90% CI, 10.8 to 21.1] for 27.5 Gy) and by nurse assessment. AC by patient self-assessment exceeded the 90% CI for the 30 Gy regimen. At 5 years, 16 (11.3%, 90% CI, 7.6 to 16.4) patients treated with 30 Gy and eight (5.8%, 90% CI, 3.3 to 9.9) patients treated with 27.5 Gy were observed to have grade 2 or more late toxicity. CONCLUSION: According to the study design, 30 Gy and 27.5 Gy resulted in acceptable cosmetic outcomes. In light of recent studies, a lower dose was chosen for the phase III trial.",
