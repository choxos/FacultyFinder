  "title": "Antibodies against platelet factor 4 and the risk of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in patients with vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is a rare complication of adenoviral vector-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. This syndrome is caused by antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4; CXCL4) that lead to platelet activation and is characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in unusual locations, including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). VITT can be classified based on anti-PF4 antibodies properties in vitro: those that require PF4 to activate platelets (PF4-dependent) and those that can activate platelets without additional PF4 (PF4-independent) in the serotonin release assay. OBJECTIVES: We aim to characterize the relationship of VITT platelet-activating profiles with CVST. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study involving patients with confirmed VITT who were tested between March and June 2021. Data were collected with an anonymized form and cases were identified as VITT with high clinical suspicion according to platelet activation assays. Anti-PF4 antibody binding regions on PF4 were further characterized with alanine scanning mutagenesis. RESULTS: Of the patients with confirmed VITT (n = 39), 17 (43.6%) had PF4-dependent antibodies and 22 (56.4%) had PF4-independent antibodies. CVST occurred almost exclusively in PF4-independent patients (11 of 22 vs 1 of 17; P < .05). Additionally, PF4-independent antibodies bound to 2 distinct epitopes on PF4, the heparin-binding region and a site typical for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia antibodies, whereas PF4-dependent antibodies bound to only the heparin-binding region. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that VITT antibodies that cause PF4-independent platelet activation represent a unique subset of patients more likely to be associated with CVST, possibly due to the 2 different types of anti-PF4 antibodies.",
