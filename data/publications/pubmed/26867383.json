  "title": "MOLECULAR CONFIRMATION OF ENTEROVIRUS FROM SEWAGE AND DRINKING WATER SAMPLES FROM THREE CITIES, PAKISTAN: A POTENTIAL RISK FACTOR FOR PUBLIC HEALTH.",
  "abstract": "Gastroenteritis causes from 4 to 10 million children deaths every year worldwide, mainly from infection with water-borne Enteroviruses, which consist of 67 diverse serogroups. Forty-two sewage and drinking water samples from three metropolitan cities of Pakistan were analyzed for the occurrence of Enterovirus by nested RT-PCR amplification. Molecular detection was based on amplification of a part of 5'UTR region of the viruses. Our results revealed an alarming situ- ation in densely populated areas of the three main cities of Pakistan: 28%, 19% and 21% of drinking water samples were positive for enteroviruses in Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore, respectively. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic study of the amplified region of the virus revealed its close relationship with Coxsackie A strains reported from Greece, Singapore and USA.",
