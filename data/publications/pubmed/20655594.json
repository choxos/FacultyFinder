  "title": "Diversion down under - Programs for offenders with mental illnesses in Australia.",
  "abstract": "This article provides an overview of mental health courts and diversion programs operating for offenders with mental illnesses in Australia. Methods of diversion that have been established in Australia include Magistrates courts diversion programs, psychiatric court liaison services and legislative powers of diversion. Some of the problems associated with diversionary options are discussed and recommendations for reform made. It is argued that no matter what form diversionary programs take, detailed consideration must be given to how the court or program will be evaluated and that sufficient funding be allocated for ongoing evaluation.",
