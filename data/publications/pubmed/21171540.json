  "title": "The supportive care needs of family members of men with advanced prostate cancer.",
  "abstract": "This exploratory study identified the supportive care needs of family members of men with advanced hormone-sensitive (HS) and hormone-refractory (HR) prostate cancer. In focus groups and individual interviews, we asked eight family members of men with HS disease and 11 family members of men with HR disease to identify their supportive care needs and recommend strategies for improving care to meet these needs. Unmet needs common to both groups were lack of information and uncertainty about the future. Unmet needs specific to family members affected by HR prostate cancer related to caregiver burden, practical assistance, and isolation. Implications for practice to improve supportive care services for families affected by APC are provided.",
