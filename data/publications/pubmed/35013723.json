  "abstract": "Heterologous SARS-CoV-2 vaccine approaches with a second mRNA-based vaccine have been favored in the recommendations of many countries over homologous vector-based ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination after reports of thromboembolic events and lower efficacy of this regimen. In the middle of 2021, the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant of concern (VoC) has become predominant in many countries worldwide. Data addressing the neutralization capacity of a heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/mRNA-based vaccination approach against the Delta VoC in comparison to the widely used homologous mRNA-based vaccine regimen are limited. Here, we compare serological immune responses of a cohort of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2-vaccinated participants with those of BNT162b2/BNT162b2 vaccinated ones and show that neutralization capacity against the Delta VoC is significantly increased in sera of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2-vaccinated participants. This overall effect can be attributed to ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2-vaccinated women, especially those with more severe adverse effects leading to sick leave following second immunization.",
