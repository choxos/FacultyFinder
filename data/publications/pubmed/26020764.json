  "title": "Dysglycemia and Cognitive Dysfunction and Ill Health in People With High CV Risk: Results From the ONTARGET/TRANSCEND Studies.",
  "abstract": "CONTEXT: Avoidance of death, disability, dementia, and cognitive dysfunction (DDCD) are high priorities for people in aging societies. Evidence is mounting that these conditions are associated with impaired glycemic control. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the strength of relationship between the degree of glucose elevation and the development of the composite elements of DDCD that impede successful/healthy aging in a population at high risk for cardiovascular disease. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The relationship between baseline fasting plasma glucose values and DDCD was determined among 31 227 participants of the Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial/Telmisartan Randomized Assessment Study in ACE intolerant Subjects With Cardiovascular Disease studies followed up for a median of 4.7 years. Several statistical models were used for the entire cohort and for those with and without normal fasting plasma glucose (ie, < 5.6 mmol/L) or a history of diabetes mellitus. RESULTS: After adjusting for age and sex, a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus was associated with an approximately 1.6 greater odds of DDCD; every 1 mmol/L higher baseline fasting plasma glucose value was associated with a 1.09 (95% confidence interval 1.07, 1.10) greater odds. These associations persisted in the multivariate models (a 1.08 95% confidence interval 1.07, 1.1 greater odds after adjustment for age, sex, education, and depression). CONCLUSION: In individuals with high cardiovascular risk, a direct relationship exists between levels of dysglycemia and the risk of DDCD. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying such an association and whether benefits can be derived from preventative strategies.",
