  "abstract": "Plant cell wall polysaccharides, including xylan, mannan, xyloglucan, and pectins, are often acetylated and members of the domain of unknown function 231 (DUF231)/trichome birefringence-like (TBL) family have been shown to be O-acetyltransferases mediating the acetylation of xylan, mannan, and xyloglucan. However, little is known about the O-acetyltransferases responsible for pectin acetylation. In this report, we biochemically characterized a suite of Arabidopsis DUF231/TBL proteins for their roles in pectin acetylation. We generated 24 TBL recombinant proteins in mammalian cells and demonstrated that 10 of them were able to transfer acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA onto the pectins homogalacturonan (HG) or rhamnogalacturonan-I (RG-I), and thus were named pectin O-acetyltransferase 1 to 10 (POAT1 to 10). It was found that POAT2,4,9,10 specifically acetylated HG and POAT5,6 acetylated RG-I, whereas POAT1,3,7,8 could act on both HG and RG-I. The acetylation of HG and RG-I by POATs was further corroborated by hydrolysis with pectin acetylesterases and by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In addition, mutations of the conserved GDS and DXXH motifs in POAT3 and POAT8 were shown to lead to a loss of their ability to acetylate HG and RG-I. Furthermore, simultaneous RNA interference downregulation of POAT1,3,6,7,8 resulted in reduced cell expansion, impaired plant growth, and decreased pectin acetylation. Together, our findings indicate that these POATs are pectin O-acetyltransferases involved in acetylation of the pectin polysaccharides HG and RG-I.",
