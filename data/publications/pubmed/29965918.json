  "title": "Ethics in Plastic Surgery: Applying the Four Common Principles to Practice.",
  "abstract": "The topic of ethics in plastic surgery remains underrepresented in the literature. By applying the four principles of biomedical ethics-respect for autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice-as described by Beauchamp and Childress to proposed ethical scenarios, this article attempts to provide plastic surgeons with a systematic approach to recognize and address ethical dilemmas as they present in day-to-day practice. Through the perspective of an experienced plastic surgeon and medical ethicist, this article is intended to spark discussion, reflection, and debate on ethical challenges in plastic surgery.",
