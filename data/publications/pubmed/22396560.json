  "abstract": "Results of studies that use laboratory tests are often easy to interpret, because we are familiar with the units and how to interpret them. However, this is not the case when the results are presented as ORs, relative risks, correlation, or scores on an unfamiliar scale. This article explains these various indices of effect sizes-how they are calculated, what they mean, and how they are interpreted.",
