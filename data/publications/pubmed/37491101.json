  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: We explored the magnitude of attrition, its pattern and risk factors for different forms of attrition in the cohort from the Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Participants were recruited from physician practices in Hamilton, Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: Postmenopausal women aged ≥55 years who had consulted their primary care physician within the last 2 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to all-cause, non-death, death, preventable and non-preventable attrition. RESULTS: All 3985 women enrolled in the study were included in the analyses. The mean age of the cohort was 69.4 (SD: 8.9) years. At the end of the follow-up, 30.2% (1206/3985) of the study participants had either died or were lost to follow-up. The pattern of attrition was monotone with most participants failing to return after a missed survey. The different types of attrition examined shared common risk factors including age, smoking and being frail but differed on factors such as educational level, race, hospitalisation, quality of life and being prefrail. CONCLUSION: Attrition in this ageing cohort was selective to some participant characteristics. Minimising potential bias associated with such non-random attrition would require targeted measures to achieve maximum possible follow-rates among the high-risk groups identified and dealing with specific reasons for attrition in the study design and analysis.",
