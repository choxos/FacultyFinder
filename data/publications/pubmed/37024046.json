  "title": "Murine Coronavirus Disease 2019 Lethality Is Characterized by Lymphoid Depletion Associated with Suppressed Antigen-Presenting Cell Functionality.",
  "abstract": "The disease severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) varies considerably from asymptomatic to serious, with fatal complications associated with dysregulation of innate and adaptive immunity. Lymphoid depletion in lymphoid tissues and lymphocytopenia have both been associated with poor disease outcomes in patients with COVID-19, but the mechanisms involved remain elusive. In this study, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) transgenic mouse models susceptible to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection were used to investigate the characteristics and determinants of lethality associated with the lymphoid depletion observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lethality of Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 infection in K18-hACE2 mice was characterized by severe lymphoid depletion and apoptosis in lymphoid tissues related to fatal neuroinvasion. The lymphoid depletion was associated with a decreased number of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and their suppressed functionality below basal levels. Lymphoid depletion with reduced APC function was a specific feature observed in SARS-CoV-2 infection but not in influenza A infection and had the greatest prognostic value for disease severity in murine COVID-19. Comparison of transgenic mouse models resistant and susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that suppressed APC function could be determined by the hACE2 expression pattern and interferon-related signaling. Thus, we demonstrated that lymphoid depletion associated with suppressed APC function characterizes the lethality of COVID-19 mouse models. Our data also suggest a potential therapeutic approach to prevent the severe progression of COVID-19 by enhancing APC functionality.",
