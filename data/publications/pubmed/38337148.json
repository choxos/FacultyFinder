  "abstract": "Storiform collagenoma, also known as sclerotic fibroma, is a relatively rare benign cutaneous tumor consisting of a proliferation of fibroblasts that shows increased production of type I collagen. It may appear as a solitary, sporadic lesion, or, especially when multiple, associated with Cowden syndrome. Giant cell collagenoma has a histopathologic appearance similar to that of storiform collagenoma with the addition of floret-type giant cells. Herein, we report the finding of multiple giant cell collagenomas arising in an individual with Cowden syndrome. In a review of the published literature, this histopathologic variant appears to be rarely observed in association with Cowden syndrome.",
