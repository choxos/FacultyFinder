  "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare clinical-pathologic characteristics and outcomes of pregnancy-associated, post-partum (PP) and nulliparous (NP) breast cancer (BC) patients and explore mediators of the poor prognosis associated with post-partum BC. METHODS: A prospective database of 233 women ≤ 40 years of age diagnosed with BC between February 2008 and January 2015 was analysed. Clinical-pathologic characteristics and outcomes among pregnant, PP and NP patients were compared using chi-square or Kruskal-Wallis tests. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS), distant DFS and overall survival (OS). Survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to evaluate factors that were potentially prognostic for the clinical outcomes of interest; a multivariable Cox model was constructed using a forward stepwise selection process. Androgen receptor (AR), GATA3, PDL1 status and the presence/absence of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were assessed when possible. Pre-treatment neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were abstracted retrospectively. Statistical significance was defined as a p value ≤ 0.05. RESULTS: Women ≤ 2 years PP had a numerically higher incidence of lymph node-positive and high-grade disease and were significantly more likely to have estrogen receptor-negative BC compared to NP controls. With a median follow-up of 7.2 years, increasingly poor outcomes were observed among NP (longest OS), > 2 years PP, ≤ 2 years PP and pregnant (shortest OS) patients, but these differences were not statistically significant. The ≤ 2 years PP group had significantly lower AR expression, a strong trend toward higher PDL1 expression and a higher expression of stromal TILs compared to NP women. CONCLUSIONS: PPBC patients had numerically lower DFS and OS compared to NP controls. Higher PDL1 and stromal TILs in PPBC suggest that adjuvant immunotherapy may be effective in the post-partum BC subgroup.",
