  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To find the association between interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 rs3027898 gene polymorphism and preeclampsia. METHODS: The case-control study was conducted from October, 2018 to September, 2019 at the Railway General Hospital and the Department of Biochemistry, Islamic International Medical College, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and comprised patients diagnosed with preeclampsia and healthy controls. The interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 polymorphism was determined using multiplex tetra primer amplification refractory mutation system polymerase chain reaction. Outcomes were determined in terms of association of interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 with preeclampsia. Data was analysed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Of the 160 subjects, 80(50% were cases with a mean age of 30±5.3 years and 80(50%) were controls with a mean age of 27±3.7 years. AC genotype was seen in 45(56.25%) cases and 30(37.5%) controls, AA genotype in 25(31.25%) cases and 30(37.5%) controls, while CC genotype was seen in 10(12.5%) cases and 20(25%) controls (p>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant association of interleukin receptor-associated kinase-1 genotypes with preeclampsia.",
