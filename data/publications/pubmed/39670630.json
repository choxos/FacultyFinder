  "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is mounting and convincing evidence that patients with postoperative troponin elevation, with or without any clinical symptoms, are at higher risk for both, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. Myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery (MINS) is a relatively newly described syndrome, and the pathogenesis is not fully understood yet. MINS is now an established syndrome and multiple guidelines address potential etiologies, triggers, as well as preventive and management strategies. RECENT FINDINGS: Surveillance in high-risk patients is required, as most MINS would otherwise be missed. There is no reliable and established preventive strategy, but several potentially avoidable triggers like hypotension, pain and anemia have been identified. Managing patients with MINS postoperatively includes minimizing triggers (such as hemodynamic abnormalities and anemia) that can continue the damage. Long-term pharmacologic strategies include beta-blockers, statins, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulation. SUMMARY: MINS affects up to 20% of surgical patients, remains clinically mostly silent, but is associated with elevated morbidity and mortality. A multidisciplinary approach, that includes involvement of anesthesiologists, for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of MINS is recommended.",
