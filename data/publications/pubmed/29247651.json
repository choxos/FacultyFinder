  "title": "Berberine-induced activation of AMPK increases hepatic FGF21 expression via NUR77.",
  "abstract": "Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hormone-like protein mainly derived from liver, exhibits multiple beneficial effect on energy metabolism. Similar to FGF21, berberine exerts anti-hyperglycemic and anti-dyslipidemic properties. Previous studies revealed that the beneficial metabolic effect of berberine was attributed to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Here we investigated the effect of berberine on FGF21 expression in primary mouse hepatocytes. As expected, berberine induced hepatic FGF21 expression in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, along with the increased expression of NUR77, a proved transcription factor of FGF21. Berberine stimulated the phosphorylations of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in primary mouse hepatocytes. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constitutively active AMPK triggered hepatic FGF21 and NUR77 expressions. The inhibition of AMPK by compound C abolished berberine-stimulated FGF21 and NUR77 expressions. These results suggest that berberine-induced activation of AMPK may contribute to hepatic FGF21 expression via NUR77.",
