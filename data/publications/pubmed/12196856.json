  "abstract": "Cervical cancer is one of the most devastating conditions that can complicate a pregnancy. Stage for stage, treatment for squamous cell cervical cancer is the same as that given in the non-pregnant patient. Radical surgery is the treatment of choice for the early stages of the disease. Although a planned delay in therapy may be considered for up to 20 weeks, for stages IA and IB1, it should be implemented cautiously and with the patient's full awareness of the risks. If delay is considered for higher stages, the patient must be aware of the paucity of data to support this plan. Chemoradiation is the standard treatment for advanced cancer of the cervix. When acceptable fetal maturity has been reached, a classical Caesarean section is usually performed prior to definitive treatment.",
