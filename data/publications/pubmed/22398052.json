  "title": "Management of inflammatory bowel disease with vitamin D: beyond bone health.",
  "abstract": "A relationship between vitamin D and several disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD), has recently been proposed. Vitamin D appears to have several important actions beyond the maintenance of bone health, including various effects on the immune system. Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the development of CD, and its analogues may have a role in the treatment of CD. Current research also suggests a role for vitamin D in counteracting some IBD-specific complications, including osteopenia, colorectal neoplasia, and depression. There remains a need for prospective studies to further delineate these relationships. Given current evidence and the apparent safety of vitamin D supplementation, it appears reasonable to screen for and treat vitamin D deficiency in patients with IBD.",
