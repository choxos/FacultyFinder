  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the outcome of arthroscopic treatment for femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) syndrome 5 years post-surgery using patient-reported outcome scores (PROMs) validated for a young and active population with hip complaints. METHODS: Patients were prospectively included in the study. A total of 184 patients [males = 110 (59.8%), females = 74 (40.2%)], with mean age 38.0, underwent arthroscopic treatment for FAI syndrome and were analysed. Preoperatively and at the 5-year follow-up, patients completed a set of self-administered web-based PROMs consisting of the International Hip Outcome Tool (iHOT-12), the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS), the Hip Sports Activity Scale (HSAS), the EuroQoL-5 Dimension Questionnaire (EQ-5D), the EQ-Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the VAS for overall hip function and overall satisfaction. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare preoperative PROM values with those obtained at the 5-year follow-up. RESULTS: A comparison of preoperative PROM scores and those obtained at the 5-year follow-up revealed statistically significant improvements for all outcome scores (p < 0.05), except for the HSAS score, which were unchanged; iHOT-12 (42.9 vs 67.2), HAGOS different subscales (50.2 vs 69.6, 55.7 vs 76.1, 59.2 vs 72.3, 41.1 vs 66.4, 30.8 vs 60.2, 31.6 vs 60.4), EQ-5D (0.570 vs 0.742), EQ-VAS (66.6 vs 74.4), HSAS (3.13 vs 3.17) and VAS for overall hip function (47.9 vs 69.2). At the 5-year follow-up, 154 patients reported that they were satisfied with surgery (84.6%). Survivorship at the 5-year follow-up was 86.4%. CONCLUSION: Arthroscopic treatment for FAI syndrome yields good patient-reported outcome at the 5-year follow-up. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II.",
