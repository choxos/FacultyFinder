  "title": "Factors Influencing Medical Laboratory Science Career Choice Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic.",
  "abstract": "The purpose of this research study was to explore: (1) the factors that influence career choice among medical laboratory science (MLS) students and recent graduates, and (2) the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on these factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted using a modified version of the Health Care Choice instrument to include questions regarding COVID-19. Seventy-two students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate-level MLS programs at a single mid-Atlantic university completed the survey. Statistical analyses were performed to identify relationships between factors that influence career choice and particular demographic factors, as well as the impact of COVID-19 on these factors. Personal interests and nature of the work were the influencing factors rated highest, followed by job prospects. Prior healthcare exposure, self-efficacy, and social influences were rated lower. There were few significant differences based on demographic factors. Participants reported being personally impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but for most it did not change their career choice. Recruitment strategies should focus on the impact that medical laboratory sciences professionals have on people's lives and the highly skilled, hands-on nature of the work, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
