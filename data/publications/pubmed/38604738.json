  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: People living with HIV (PLHIV) have a higher risk of developing pulmonary hypertension (PH) with subsequent poorer prognosis. This review aimed to determine the (1) survival outcomes and (2) proportion of emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalisations of PLHIV and PH. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies reporting survival outcomes for PLHIV and PH. Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus and Cochrane Library), trial registries and conference proceedings were searched until 22 July 2023. We pooled similar measures of effect, assessed apriori subgroups and used meta-regression to determine mortality and associated variables. RESULTS: 5248 studies were identified; 28 studies were included with a total of 5459 PLHIV and PH. The mean survival (95% CI) of PLHIV and PH was 37.4 months (29.9 to 44.8). Participants alive at 1, 2 and 3 years were 85.8% (74.1% to 95.0%), 75.2% (61.9% to 86.7%) and 61.9% (51.8% to 71.6%), respectively. ED visits and hospitalisation rates were 73.3% (32.5% to 99.9%) and 71.2% (42.4% to 94.2%), respectively. More severe disease, measured by echocardiogram, was associated with poorer prognosis (β -0.01, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.00, p=0.009). Survival was higher in high-income countries compared with lower-income countries (β 0.50, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.73, p<0.001) and in Europe compared with the America (β 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.75, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study confirms poor prognosis and high healthcare utilisation for PLHIV and PH. Prognosis is associated with country income level, geographic region and PH severity. This highlights the importance of screening in this population. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42023395023.",
