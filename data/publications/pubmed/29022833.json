  "title": "How to Initiate Dementia Care Networks? Processes, Barriers, and Facilitators During the Development Process of a Practice-Oriented Website Toolkit Out of Research Results.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite its high relevance, scientific evidence often fails to be disseminated into practice. Information websites can be a successful information dissemination tool, but very little is known about the processes involved in the interdisciplinary development of such websites. This article aims to demonstrate the processes, barriers, and facilitators during the development and publication of a practice-friendly information website grounded in scientifically based research findings about dementia care networks obtained by the DemNet-D study. METHOD: The qualitative data of this article are based on a work progress protocol and a recorded interview with the project's science journalist. The interview was transcribed, analyzed, and coded based on structured content analysis. Quantitative data were extracted to display the website usage rate. RESULTS: The results indicate that interdisciplinary teamwork is an essential factor for successful website development. Furthermore, the use of a formalized model can help to organize the development structure. To transform scientific content, a specialized expert in the field is needed. Continuous evaluations and marketing strategies are vital for the success of a website. The final website had a high access rate 1 month after launch. CONCLUSION: Crucial processes, barriers, and facilitators during the development of a practice-related information website about dementia care networks are presented and discussed. These findings can help people who aim to disseminate research findings to other practitioner-associated priority groups as well as public health-related groups.",
