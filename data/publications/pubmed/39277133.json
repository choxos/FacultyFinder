  "title": "Nrf2 pathways in neuroprotection: Alleviating mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in aging.",
  "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment are widespread phenomena among the elderly, being crucial factors that contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an important regulator of cellular defense systems, including that against oxidative stress. As such, increased Nrf2 activity may serve as a strategy to avert mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive decline. Scientific data on Nrf2-mediated neuroprotection was collected from PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct, specifically addressing mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in older people. Search terms included \"Nrf2\", \"mitochondrial dysfunction,\" \"cognitive impairment,\" and \"neuroprotection.\" Studies focusing on in vitro and in vivo models and clinical investigations were included to review Nrf2's therapeutic potential comprehensively. The relative studies have demonstrated that increased Nrf2 activity could improve mitochondrial performance, decrease oxidative pressure, and mitigate cognitive impairment. To a large extent, this is achieved through the modulation of critical cellular signalling pathways such as the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway, mitochondrial biogenesis, and neuroinflammatory responses. The present review summarizes the recent progress in comprehending the molecular mechanisms regarding the neuroprotective benefits mediated by Nrf2 through its substantial role against mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment. This review also emphasizes Nrf2-target pathways and their contribution to cognitive function improvement and rescue from mitochondria-related abnormalities as treatment strategies for neurodegenerative diseases that often affect elderly individuals.",
