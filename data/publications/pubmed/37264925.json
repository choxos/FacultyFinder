  "title": "Management and Outcomes of Wilms Tumor With Suprarenal Intravascular Extension: A Pediatric Surgical Oncology Research Collaborative Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe management and outcomes from a contemporary cohort of children with Wilms tumor complicated by inferior vena caval thrombus. BACKGROUND: The largest series of these patients was published almost 2 decades ago. Since then, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been commonly used to manage these patients, and outcomes have not been reported. METHODS: Retrospective review of 19 North American centers between 2009 and 2019. Patient and disease characteristics, management, and outcomes were investigated and analyzed. RESULTS: Of 124 patients, 81% had favorable histology (FH), and 52% were stage IV. IVC thrombus level was infrahepatic in 53 (43%), intrahepatic in 32 (26%), suprahepatic in 14 (11%), and cardiac in 24 (19%). Neoadjuvant chemotherapy using a 3-drug regimen was administered in 82% and postresection radiation in 90%. Thrombus level regression was 45% overall, with suprahepatic level showing the best response (62%). Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was potentially avoided in 67%. The perioperative complication rate was significantly lower after neoadjuvant chemotherapy [(25%) vs upfront surgery (55%); P =0.005]. CPB was not associated with higher complications [CPB (50%) vs no CPB (27%); P =0.08]. Two-year event-free survival was 93% and overall survival was 96%, higher in FH cases (FH 98% vs unfavorable histology/anaplastic 82%; P =0.73). Neither incomplete resection nor viable thrombus cells affected event-free survival or overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal therapy resulted in excellent outcomes, even with advanced-stage disease and cardiac extension. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased the need for CPB to facilitate resection. Complete thrombectomy may not always be necessary.",
