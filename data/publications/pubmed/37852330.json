  "title": "Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty as an early tool against obesity: a multicenter international study on an overweight population.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is an effective, minimally invasive gastric remodeling procedure to treat mild and moderate obesity. Early adoption of ESG may be desirable to try to halt progression of obesity, but there are few data on its efficacy and safety for overweight patients. METHODS: This was a multicenter, international, analytical case series. Six U.S., 1 Brazilian, 1 Mexican, and 1 Indian center were included. Overweight patients according to local practice undergoing ESG were considered eligible for the study. The end points were percent total weight loss (%TWL), body mass index (BMI) reduction, rate of BMI normalization, and rate of adverse events. RESULTS: One hundred eighty-nine patients with a mean age of 42.6 ± 14.1 years and a mean BMI of 27.79 ± 1.17 kg/m[2] were included. All procedures were successfully accomplished, and there were 3 intraprocedural adverse events (1.5%). The mean %TWL was 12.28% ± 3.21%, 15.03% ± 5.30%, 15.27% ± 5.28%, and 14.91% ± 5.62% at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively. At 12 and 24 months, 76% and 86% of patients achieved normal BMI, with a mean BMI reduction of 4.13 ± 1.46 kg/m[2] and 4.25 ± 1.58 kg/m[2]. There was no difference in mean %TWL in the first quartile versus the fourth quartile of BMI in any of the time points. However, the BMI normalization rate was statistically higher in the first group at 6 and 12 months (6 months, 100% vs 48.5% [P < .01]; 12 months, 86.2% vs 50% [P < .01]; 24 months, 84.6% vs 76.1% [P = .47]; 36 months, 86.3% vs 66.6% [P = .26]). CONCLUSIONS: ESG is safe and effective in treating overweight patients with high BMI normalization rates. It could help halt or delay the progression to obesity.",
