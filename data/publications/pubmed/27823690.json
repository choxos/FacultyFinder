  "title": "Baseline characteristics, adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor treatment patterns, and in-hospital outcomes of myocardial infarction patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in the prospective Canadian Observational AntiPlatelet sTudy (COAPT).",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Contemporary use of dual antiplatelet therapy and consistency with guideline recommendations in acute coronary syndrome patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have not been well characterized. METHODS: The COAPT was a prospective, observational, multicenter, longitudinal study of patients with myocardial infarction (MI) undergoing PCI. Baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, processes of care, factors associated with switching to and from novel adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitors (ADPris), and in-hospital outcomes are described. RESULTS: Among 2,179 MI patients undergoing PCI during their index hospitalization, 1,328 (60.9%) had ST elevation. Initial ADPri use included clopidogrel in 1,812 (83.2%), prasugrel in 125 (5.7%), and ticagrelor in 242 (11.1%). At discharge, 1,597 patients (73.4%) were prescribed clopidogrel, 220 (10.1%) prasugrel, and 358 (16.5%) ticagrelor. Switching between ADPri therapies during the index hospitalization occurred in 15.3%, 22.4%, and 25.2% of patients initially started on clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor, respectively. Most switches over the 15-month study period occurred during the index admission (16.8% of patients vs 4.4% switches postdischarge). Major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 7.5% of patients during the index hospitalization. In-hospital bleeding events occurred in 6.0% of patients and most were mild. CONCLUSIONS: Despite randomized trial evidence and guideline recommendations, only a minority of Canadian MI patients undergoing PCI initially received or were discharged on one of the newer ADPri agents. These findings suggest an opportunity to improve upon the appropriate selection of the ADPris at index hospitalization and discharge in Canadian MI patients undergoing PCI.",
