  "title": "Physical Activity: A Systematic Review to Inform Nurse Recommendations During Treatment for Colorectal Cancer.",
  "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in the world (American Cancer Society [ACS], 2021). Because of increasing survival rates, there is a need improve survivors' quality of life (QOL), physical functioning, recurrence risk, and comorbidity prevalence (ACS, 2020). Many patients with CRC have poor QOL during and after treatment; other common side effects include fatigue, depression, anxiety, and decreased sleep quality (Bourke et al., 2014; Cramer et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2020). Focusing on the treatment period is important because physical activity (PA) may decrease side effects and prevent PA decline and functional decline, both of which can become significant barriers to PA following treatment. In addition, patients with CRC have a higher rate of comorbidities than patients without cancer, making lifestyle changes pre- and post-treatment particularly important for their continued survival and QOL (ACS, 2020).",
