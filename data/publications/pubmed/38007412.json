  "title": "Molecular characterization of lumpy skin disease virus from recent outbreaks in Pakistan.",
  "abstract": "Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a contagious viral transboundary disease listed as a notifiable disease by the World Organization of Animal Health (WOAH). The first case of this disease was reported in Pakistan in late 2021. Since then, numerous outbreaks have been documented in various regions and provinces across the country. The current study primarily aimed to analyze samples collected during LSD outbreaks in cattle populations in the Sindh and Punjab provinces of Pakistan. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using partial sequences of the GPCR, p32, and RP030 genes. Collectively, the LSDV strains originating from outbreaks in Pakistan exhibited a noticeable clustering pattern with LSDV strains reported in African, Middle Eastern, and Asian countries, including Egypt, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, India, China, and Thailand. The precise reasons behind the origin of the virus strain and its subsequent spread to Pakistan remain unknown. This underscores the need for further investigations into outbreaks across the country. The findings of the current study can contribute to the establishment of effective disease control strategies, including the implementation of a mass vaccination campaign in disease-endemic countries such as Pakistan.",
