  "title": "Correlating Ex Vivo Carotid Calcification Measurements With Cerebrovascular Symptoms: A Proof-of-Concept Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the ability of ex vivo derived Agatston, Volume, and Density-Volume calcium scores or calcium density measurements to differentiate between carotid plaques based on preoperative cerebrovascular symptomatology. METHODS: Thirty-eight carotid plaques were acquired from standard endarterectomy. Micro-computed tomography was performed on the ex vivo samples. Image series were downsampled to represent the resolution of clinical multidetector computed tomography. Agatston, Volume, and Density-Volume carotid calcium scores were then calculated using coronary methodologies. The fractions of low- and high-density calcification were also determined. RESULTS: The coronary calcium scores could not differentiate between carotid plaques from asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients. However, plaques from asymptomatic patients contained significantly lower fractions of low-density calcification and higher fractions of high-density calcification. CONCLUSIONS: Screening for carotid calcium density in noncontrast computed tomography could reflect plaque stability.",
