  "title": "Risk factors for prolonged opioid consumption following hip arthroscopy: A secondary analysis of the Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed controlled Trial and embedded cohort study.",
  "abstract": "PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to identify prognostic risk factors for prolonged opioid use at 2 and 6 weeks after hip arthroscopy using data from the Femoroacetabular Impingement RandomiSed controlled Trial and its external validation cohort study. METHODS: Opioids were prescribed for postoperative pain management at the surgeon's discretion, with a majority being prescribed a combination of oxycodone and paracetamol (5/325 mg). Prolonged opioid use was defined as the ongoing use of any dosage of opioids reported at either 2 or 6 weeks after surgery to treat femoroacetabular impingement, as recorded in the patient's study medication log. Multivariable logistic regressions were performed to evaluate patient and surgical characteristics, such as preoperative opioid use, type of surgical procedure and intraoperative cartilage state that may be associated with prolonged opioid use at either 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 265 and 231 patients were included for analysis at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively, respectively. The median age of participants was 35 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 27-42) and 33% were female. At 2 weeks postoperatively, female sex (odds ratio [OR]: 2.56; 95% confidence interval: [CI] 1.34-4.98, p = 0.005), higher body mass index (BMI) (OR: 1.10; 95% CI: 1.02-1.18, p = 0.009), active tobacco use (OR: 4.06; 95% CI: 1.90-8.97, p < 0.001), preoperative opioid use (OR: 10.1; 95% CI: 3.25-39.1, p < 0.001) and an Outerbridge classification of ≥3 (OR: 2.33; 95% CI: 1.25-4.43, p = 0.009) were significantly associated with prolonged opioid use. At 6 weeks postoperatively, only preoperative opioid use was significantly associated with prolonged opioid consumption (OR: 10.6; 95% CI: 3.60-32.6, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Preoperative opioid use was significantly associated with continued opioid use at 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively. Specific patient factors including female sex, higher BMI, active tobacco use and more severe cartilage damage should be considered in developing targeted strategies to limit opioid use after surgery. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.",
