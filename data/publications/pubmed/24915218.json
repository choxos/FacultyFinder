  "abstract": "During a 2-year period, the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) acquisition rate was 10.9% (40/368) in patients who had shared a room with a newly detected VRE carrier. Exposure to vancomycin and to anti-anaerobic antibiotics were identified as independent risk factors for VRE acquisition. Sensitivity of the first rectal VRE screening was less than 50%.",
