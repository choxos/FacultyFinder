  "title": "Ischemia of the hand secondary to radial artery thrombosis: A report of three cases.",
  "abstract": "Upper extremity arterial thrombosis, though rare, is more prevalent on the ulnar side of the circulation, with the most common etiology being repetitive blunt trauma to the hypothenar eminence. Radial artery thrombosis is even more rare and when it does occur, is associated most often with iatrogenic cannulation, producing subsequent thrombi and emboli. Three cases of spontaneous thrombosis of the radial artery extending to the superficial palmar arch and the princeps pollicis artery are presented here. Two patients underwent thrombectomies and one underwent excision of the thrombosed segment and reconstruction with a reversed saphenous vein graft. The etiology of the thrombus was consistent with cancer in two cases and trauma in one.",
