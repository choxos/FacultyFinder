  "title": "Symptoms in Persons With Either Active or Inactive Crohn's Disease Are Agnostic to Disease Phenotype: The Magic in Imagine Study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the relationship between disease symptoms and disease phenotype in a large Canadian cohort of persons with Crohn's disease (CD). METHODS: Adults (n=1515) with CD from 14 Canadian centers participated in the Mind And Gut Interactions Cohort (MAGIC) between 2018 and 2023. Disease activity was measured using the 24-item IBD Symptom Inventory-Short-Form (IBDSI-SF). We compared the symptoms commonly associated with active versus inactive disease, and explored symptoms patterns in relation to disease phenotype, based on the Montreal Classification. To assess psychological status the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were used. RESULTS: The mean disease duration was 15.6Â±11.8 years. The 5 most common symptoms were similar for those with active disease, although at higher prevalence (89% to 98%) versus those with inactive disease (47% to 79%), and included fatigue, diarrhea, gas, bloating, and urgency. The intensity of symptoms was higher in those with active than inactive IBDSI-SF scores. The rank order and relative distribution of the symptoms and intensity of the symptoms reported were similar between those with different disease phenotypes B1, B2, and B3 and L1, L2, and L3. Persons with active IBDSI-SF had a higher prevalence of anxiety (24.6%) and depression (38.2%) versus persons with inactive IBDSI-SF (6.3% and 8%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with CD with active and inactive disease by IBDSI, experience similar symptoms, but the prevalence of symptoms and their intensity is greater in persons with active IBDSI. Persons with inactive IBDSI report many symptoms. There was no difference in symptom reporting by disease behavior or location.",
