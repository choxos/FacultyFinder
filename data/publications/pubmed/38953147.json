  "title": "The pervasive influence of systems of power on transition readiness for adult care in sickle cell disease: A qualitative study.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Adolescence and young adulthood are vulnerable developmental periods for individuals with sickle cell disease (SCD), particularly given the impact of social inequities, challenges with transitioning to adult healthcare services, and increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Systems of power, such as institutionalized and interpersonal manifestations of bias, could impact SCD transfer and engagement in adult care through their influence on healthcare transition readiness; yet research in this area is limited. OBJECTIVE: To characterize how systems of power impact transition readiness factors described in the Social-ecological Model of AYA Readiness for Transition to Promote Health Equity (SMART-E) framework at the patient, caregiver, and practitioner levels. METHODS: Pediatric adolescents and young adults (AYA), transferred AYA, caregivers, and practitioners participated in semi-structured focus groups and individual interviews examining health equity and systems of power during healthcare transition. Focus groups/interviews were transcribed and coded using a deductive approach via the updated SMART-E framework. RESULTS: Ten pediatric AYA with SCD, nine transferred AYA with SCD, eight caregivers, and nine practitioners participated in a focus group or interview. Qualitative findings across reporters emphasize the impact of systems of power (e.g., racial bias and disease stigma) on knowledge, skills and self-efficacy, beliefs and expectations, goals and motivation, and emotions and psychosocial functioning at the patient, caregiver, and practitioner levels. CONCLUSION: Systems of power are prevalent with respect to transition barriers for AYA with SCD and their supports. Structural, institutional, and individual factors with potential to reduce the influence of systems of power should be further identified and targeted for intervention.",
