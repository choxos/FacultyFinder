  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The incidence of childhood overweight and obesity has been increasing in recent years. Immune dysregulation has been demonstrated as a condition related to childhood obesity. Whether the neonatal immune status is related to infant overweight and obesity at 1 year of age is unclear. METHODS: To explore the relationship between neonatal cytokines and infant overweight and obesity, we conducted a prospective study in Suzhou Municipal Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing Medical University from 2015 to 2016. 514 neonates were recruited and their dried blood spots were collected after birth. Infants were grouped into normal size groups and overweight and obesity groups based on BMI at 1 year of age. 27 neonatal cytokines levels were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: 370 infants were included in final analysis. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), interleukin-17A (IL17A) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) levels were independently associated with childhood overweight and obesity (OR =1.27, 95%CI 1.03, 1.57; OR =1.29, 95%CI: 1.06, 1.60; OR =0.69, 95%CI: 0.49, 0.96). Additionally, neonatal GCSF and IL17A levels were positively associated with increased BMI (β = 0.11, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.19; β = 0.07, 95%CI 0.01, 013) and BMI z-scores (β = 0.10, 95%CI: 0.02, 0.18; β = 0.06, 95%CI 0.01, 0.13). Neonatal PDGF-BB levels were negatively associated with BMI (β = -0.12, 95%CI: -0.23, -0.01) and BMI z-scores (β = -0.12, 95%CI: -0.23, -0.01). The inverse probability weighting (IPW) was performed to account for potential selection bias of this study, and the results were consistent with the above mentioned findings. CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal GCSF, IL17A and PDGF-BB levels were correlated with infant overweight and obesity at 1 year of age, suggesting that early life immune status play a significant role of late obesity.",
