  "abstract": "A prospective study was undertaken to determine if patients recover pre-injury level of shoulder function 1 year after 1 part proximal humeral fractures. Of the 67 patients enrolled, 43 were female and 24 male with an average age of 64.8 years (range, 25-90 years). All patients underwent a similar treatment protocol consisting of early therapy for range of shoulder motion and strengthening. Baseline demographics and functional assessment, including the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) evaluation form and the SF-36, were obtained at the time of injury. Functional and demographic data were evaluated with a Student's t test. Fifty-four patients (80%) completed a 1-year follow-up. By 3 months, all patients attained radiographic and clinical evidence of union and no loss of reduction. At 1 year, the ASES score was similar to pre-injury status (93.7 vs 99.1; P = .12). The range of shoulder motion of the affected side was diminished compared to the unaffected extremity in internal rotation (P < .001) and external rotation (P < .001) but not forward flexion. Patients, who sustain minimally displaced proximal humeral fractures treated nonoperatively, largely returned to preoperative functional status at 1-year follow-up. Patients should be counseled and made aware of the decreased range of shoulder motion following this fracture.",
