  "title": "Persistent Elevation of Thyroglobulin in Patient Treated for Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Ten-Year Review.",
  "abstract": "Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (DTC) is increasing in prevalence due to better diagnostic tools and excellent long-term survival. This study is to understand the outcome of twenty-six patients with DTC over a period of 10 years after the initial treatment with surgery and radioiodine therapy. Our study analysis showed no deaths, and indicated that older men were more likely to have persistent disease. Further studies are needed to focus on cost effective long-term management of DTC.",
