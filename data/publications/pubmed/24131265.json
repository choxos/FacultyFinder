  "title": "Evaluation of the RAAPS Risk Screening Tool for Use in Detecting Adolescents With Depression.",
  "abstract": "PROBLEM: Screening is vital to quality adolescent care, but using multiple surveys to screen depression and interrelated risk behaviors is difficult. The aim of this study was to evaluate RAAPS (Rapid Assessment for Adolescent Preventive Services) effectiveness as a screening tool for adolescent depression. METHODS: Cronbach's α, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were assessed. FINDINGS: Cronbach's α was 0.66 overall. The ROC curve is 0.86. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.86 and 0.71, respectively. The positive predictive value is 0.46 and the negative predictive value is 0.95. CONCLUSION: Results indicate RAAPS may be an effective screening tool for identifying adolescent depression.",
