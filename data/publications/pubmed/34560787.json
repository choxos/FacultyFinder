  "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The Nuss procedure is the most common and preferred operative correction of pectus excavatum. Surgeon preference and patient factors can result in variations in Nuss procedure technique. We hypothesize that certain techniques are associated with increased risk of complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS:  We performed a single-center retrospective review of Nuss operations from 2016 to 2020. Variations in intraoperative techniques included sternal elevator (SE) use, number of bars placed, and usage of bilateral stabilizing sutures. Patient demographics, intraoperative data, and postoperative outcomes were reported as median with interquartile ranges or percentages. Statistical significance (p < 0.05) was determined with Wilcoxon's rank-sum and chi-square tests. Multivariate analysis was performed to control for introduction of intercostal nerve cryoablation and surgeon volume, and reported as odds ratio with 95% confidence interval. RESULTS:  Two hundred and sixty-five patients were identified. Patients repaired with two bars were older with a larger Haller index (HI). Patient demographics were not significantly different for SE or stabilizing suture use. Placement of two bars was associated with significantly increased risk of readmission. Similarly, SE use was associated with increased risk of pleural effusion and readmission. Finally, the use of bilateral stabilizing sutures resulted in less frequent slipped bars without statistical significance. CONCLUSION:  Older patients with a larger HI were more likely to need two bars placed to repair pectus excavatum. Placement of multiple bars and SE use are associated with significantly higher odds of certain complications.",
