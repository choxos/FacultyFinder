  "title": "Aesthetic composite veneers for an adult patient with amelogenesis imperfecta: a case report.",
  "abstract": "UNLABELLED: This case has been presented as part of the continual assessment requirement for the MSc in Aesthetic Dentistry, King's College Dental Institute. Amelogenesis imperfecta (AI) is a hereditary disorder of enamel formation, affecting both the permanent and deciduous dentitions. It can be classified into hypoplastic, hypomaturation and hypocalcified types and presents with different hereditary patterns. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of amelogenesis imperfecta, including a detailed case report for an aesthetically concerned adult patient presenting in general practice with a Witkop's Type IA defect managed with the placement of direct, layered resin composite veneers. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Amelogenesis imperfecta patients are susceptible to the restorative cycle of replacement restorations like any other patient, but start with a distinct disadvantage.This case report demonstrates a minimally invasive, relatively simple and cost-effective option for the aesthetic correction of a case of hypoplastic amelogenesis imperfecta with layered composite veneers.
