  "title": "Ecological change of the gut microbiota during pregnancy and progression to dyslipidemia.",
  "abstract": "The composition of the gut microbiome was previously found to be associated with clinical responses to dyslipidemia, but there is limited consensus on the dynamic change of the gut microbiota during pregnancy and the specific microbiome characteristics linked to dyslipidemia in pregnant women. We collected fecal samples from 513 pregnant women at multiple time points during pregnancy in a prospective cohort. Taxonomic composition and functional annotations were determined by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. The predictive potential of gut microbiota on the risk of dyslipidemia was determined. The gut microbiome underwent dynamic changes during pregnancy, with significantly lower alpha diversity observed in dyslipidemic patients compared to their healthy counterparts. Several genera, including Bacteroides, Paraprevotella, Alistipes, Christensenellaceae R7 group, Clostridia UCG-014, and UCG-002 were negatively associated with lipid profiles and dyslipidemia. Further metagenomic analysis recognized a common set of pathways involved in gastrointestinal inflammation, where disease-specific microbes played an important role. Machine learning analysis confirmed the link between the microbiome and its progression to dyslipidemia, with a micro-averaged AUC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.782-0.855) combined with blood biochemical data. Overall, the human gut microbiome, including Alistipes and Bacteroides, was associated with the lipid profile and maternal dyslipidemia during pregnancy by perturbing inflammatory functional pathways. Gut microbiota combined with blood biochemical data at the mid-pregnancy stage could predict the risk of dyslipidemia in late pregnancy. Therefore, the gut microbiota may represent a potential noninvasive diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for preventing dyslipidemia in pregnancy.",
