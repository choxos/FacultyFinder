  "title": "Global 3'-UTRome of porcine immature Sertoli cells altered by acute heat stress.",
  "abstract": "Alternative polyadenylation (APA) affects the composition of cis-elements in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), to regulate gene expression and localization, and subsequently the downstream biological processes. Acute heat stress could change rapidly the cellular transcriptome, however the underlying molecular changes are less explored. Here, we systematically catalogued the global 3'-UTRome dynamics, by analyzing our previously reported transcriptome sequencing data of porcine immature Sertoli (iST) cells before (Control group), acute heat stress treatment at 43 °C for 0.5h (HS0.5 group), and 36h recovery culture (HS0.5-R36h group) after acute heat stress treatment. After three group comparisons (HS0.5 vs. Control, HS0.5-R36 vs. HS0.5, and HS0.5-R36 vs. Control), DaPars (dynamic analysis of alternative polyadenylation) identified 639, 464 and 290 mRNAs, and APAtrap (a tool to identify APA sites and detect changes of APA site usage) identified 713, 518 and 321 mRNAs, with significantly different 3'-UTRs (Padj.≤0.05), respectively. These genes with different 3'-UTR patterns were mainly enriched in P53, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, HIF-1, apoptosis, PI3K-Akt and AMPK signaling pathways. Further analysis identified that average 3'-UTR lengths of Acss2, Inpp1 and Nr1h4 were more than 140 nt longer (HS0.5-R36 vs. HS0.5), and contained different cis-elements (PAS, CPE and microRNA binding sites). Moreover, Hsp70.2, Inhbb and Dhrs were identified to have extremely different 3'-UTR abundances. Further 3'RACE assays validated several 3'-UTRs of Nr1h4, and RT-qPCR confirmed the abundance changes of different 3'-UTR isoforms for Nr1h4 and Hsp70.2. Our findings provide useful information and resources to further uncover the molecular role of 3'-UTR, in regulating the response of porcine iST cells to acute heat stress.",
