  "title": "Comprehensive analysis based in silico study of alternative bisphenols - Environmental explanation of prostate cancer progression.",
  "abstract": "Industries have begun to shift their focus on exploring substitute chemicals for BPA due to their concerns about safety and environmental pollution. In recent years, alternative bisphenols, including BPS, BPF, and BPAF have been extensively used as BPA substitutes. Based on previous studies, BPA is considered a risk factor for prostate cancer. This work aims to explore the interactive genes related to alternative bisphenols and prostate cancer using the TCGA, CTD, and GEO databases. After performing the GO and KEGG enrichment analysis, a correlation between alternative bisphenols and prostate cancer was detected using bioinformatics analysis. Among the interactive genes of alternative bisphenols, ferroptosis-related genes revealed strong correlations with prostate cancer. Moreover, the prognostic predictive model, ROC curve, and survival analysis confirmed that ferroptosis-related genes displayed a strong correlation in the prognosis of prostate cancer. We successfully evaluated the relationship between prostate cancer and alternative bisphenols; as a result, a novel approach was proposed to explore the damaging effect of environmental endocrine disruptors.",
