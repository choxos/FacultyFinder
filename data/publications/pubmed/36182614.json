  "title": "Patient-reported Benefits and Limitations of Mobile Health Technologies for Diabetes in Pregnancy: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: For women with pre-existing and gestational diabetes, pregnancy involves specialized and intensive medical care to optimize maternal and infant outcomes. Medical management for patients with diabetes in pregnancy typically occurs via frequent face-to-face outpatient appointments. COVID-19-induced barriers to face-to-face care have identified the need for high-quality, patient-centred virtual health-care modalities, such as mobile health (mHealth) technologies. Our aim in this review was to identify the patient-reported benefits and limitations of mHealth technologies among women with diabetes in pregnancy. We also aimed to determine how the women's experiences aligned with the best practice standards for patient-centred communication. METHODS: The framework presented by Arksey and O'Malley for conducting scoping reviews, with refinements by Levac etÂ al, was used to guide this review. Relevant studies were identified through comprehensive database searches of MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare and PsycINFO. Thomas and Harden's methods for the thematic synthesis of qualitative research in systematic reviews guided the synthesis of patient-reported benefits and limitations of mHealth technology. RESULTS: Overall, 19 studies describing the use of 16 unique mHealth technologies among 742 women were included in the final review. Patient-reported benefits of mHealth included convenience, support of psychosocial well-being and facilitation of diabetes self-management. Patient-reported limitations included lack of important technological features, perceived burdensome aspects of mHealth and lack of trust in virtual health care. CONCLUSIONS: Women with diabetes report some benefits from mHealth use during pregnancy. Codesigning future technologies with end users may help address the perceived limitations and effectiveness of mHealth technologies.",
