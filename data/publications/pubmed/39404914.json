  "abstract": "Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors provide cardiovascular and kidney benefits to patients with heart failure (HF) and/or chronic kidney disease (CKD), regardless of diabetes status and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Despite robust data demonstrating the efficacy of SGLT-2 inhibitors in both ambulatory and hospital settings, real-world evidence suggests slow and varied adoption of SGLT2 inhibitors among patients hospitalized for HF. Barriers to implementation of SGLT2i may include clinicians' concerns regarding potential adverse events such as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), volume depletion, and symptomatic hypoglycemia; or concerns regarding physiologically expected reductions in eGFR. Guidelines lack specific, practical safety data and definitive recommendations regarding in-hospital initiation and continuation of SGLT2i in patients hospitalized with HF. In this review, we discuss the safety of in-hospital SGLT2 inhibitor initiation based on recent trials and highlight the clinical implications of their early use in patients hospitalized for HF.",
