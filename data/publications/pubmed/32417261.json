  "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: There has been a lack of consensus on which criteria are important when selecting health-related outcome measures (HROM), especially in primary health care A Delphi consensus was undertaken to identify core criteria for selecting among different HROM and contextual factors affecting decision-making. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A Delphi survey using standard methodology (consensus set as 75% agreement) was sent to primary care practitioners, administrators, policymakers, researchers and experts in HROM development. Criteria (n = 35) were selected from a targeted literature search; questions probed contextual factors that may influence selection of core criteria including the following: 1) weighting, 2) clinical contexts, and 3) core areas. RESULTS: Participants (n = 45) achieved consensus on 17 items in round 1 (plus four new criteria), with one more item in round 2. Unequal weighting of criteria was favored, and the type of clinical scenario did not influence selection of HROM. CONCLUSION: Eighteen core criteria from 39 were identified for inclusion in a core set, reflected predominately aspects of feasibility and acceptability. This is the first study providing evidence that contextual factors affect selection of HROM in a core criteria set. Care in primary health care is complex, and therefore, the items not reaching consensus may reflect this heterogeneity.",
