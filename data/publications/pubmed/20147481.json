  "title": "Composite measures in psoriatic arthritis: GRAPPA 2008.",
  "abstract": "At the 2008 annual meeting of GRAPPA (Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) in Leeds, UK, members discussed the value and current status of composite measures for the assessment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In plenary presentations, examples of composite measures developed for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) were reviewed, followed by a presentation of the assessment of disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus. Three recently devised composite methods of assessing activity or response in PsA also were presented. Considerable discussion followed in breakout groups, and members agreed that a new composite measure specifically for PsA is necessary. The composite measure should include components that encompass the spectrum of psoriatic disease, i.e., in addition to assessment of peripheral joints, it should include assessment of sacroiliitis, spondylitis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, as well as skin and nail disease.",
