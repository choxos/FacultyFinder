  "title": "Protein Biomarkers and Cardiovascular Outcomes in People With Type 2 Diabetes and Acute Coronary Syndrome: The ELIXA Biomarker Study.",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To use protein biomarkers to identify people with type 2 diabetes at high risk of cardiovascular outcomes and death. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Biobanked serum from 4,957 ELIXA (Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial participants was analyzed. Forward-selection Cox models identified independent protein risk factors for major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death that were compared with a previously validated biomarker panel. RESULTS: NT-proBNP and osteoprotegerin predicted both outcomes. In addition, trefoil factor 3 predicted MACE, and angiopoietin-2 predicted death (C = 0.70 and 0.79, respectively, compared with 0.63 and 0.66 for clinical variables alone). These proteins had all previously been identified and validated. Notably, C statistics for just NT-proBNP plus clinical risk factors were 0.69 and 0.78 for MACE and death, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NT-proBNP and other proteins independently predict cardiovascular outcomes in people with type 2 diabetes following acute coronary syndrome. Adding other biomarkers only marginally increased NT-proBNP's prognostic value.",
