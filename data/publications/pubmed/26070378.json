  "title": "Thinking like an expert: surgical decision making as a cyclical process of being aware.",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Education researchers are studying the practices of high-stake professionals as they learn how to better train for flexibility under uncertainty. This study explores the \"Reconciliation Cycle\" as the core element of an intraoperative decision-making model of how experienced surgeons assess and respond to challenges. METHODS: We analyzed 32 semistructured interviews using constructivist grounded theory to develop a model of intraoperative decision making. Using constant comparison analysis, we built on this model with 9 follow-up interviews about the most challenging cases described in our dataset. RESULTS: The Reconciliation Cycle constituted an iterative process of \"gaining\" and \"transforming information.\" The cyclical nature of surgeons' decision making suggested that transforming information requires a higher degree of awareness, not yet accounted by current conceptualizations of situation awareness. CONCLUSIONS: This study advances the notion of situation awareness in surgery. This characterization will support further investigations on how expert and nonexpert surgeons implement strategies to cope with unexpected events.",
